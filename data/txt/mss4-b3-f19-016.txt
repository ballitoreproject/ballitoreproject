Dear Uncle


        Thy Letter of the 19th Current adds a fresh favour to the many I have received from thee for which I am very thankful. I was concerned to hear of my Aunts indisposition; but as I was since informed of her being at the Meeting of Carlow, hope it is pretty well, if not entirely removed. I am very anxious to hear how my dear Cousin Debby is now, having been just acquainted the critical period was arrived, on which so much depended the satisfaction of her Friends: That the rest of the Family were pretty well is very pleasing intelligence. Upon inquiry I do not hear of any vacancies of Clerkships in town except at the house of Strangman, Courtenay & Ridgway: I spoke to H Ridgway concerning Jno Thacker who gave me to understand they would not chuse to employ any one who had not a competent knowledge of business before as young men who come merely to learn are often apt to go away as soon as they might become useful. I suppose J:T: must be pretty well acquainted with business as he lived with some of his Friends in Dublin for a considerable time I told him so & as Joshua Strangman intends for the Half Years Meeting there may be an opportunity of speaking more about it. I wish I could give thee a more satisfactory account of thy pen knife than my last afforded I have made a very strict inquiry & am apprehensive I cannot recover it. I received the Linen safe & am obliged to thee for paying for it I will endorse 2..2.2 [sic] on thy Note which is for 40. from the 1st of this month 1780. We have no Franks directed to the House at present as soon as we get a supply I intend to send someI had not any conversation with T: Geldart when in Corkonly just saw him at a distance. Archibalds Wife has been in a very dangerous way some time since but is now better Friends in general are I believe pretty well. Pray remember me very affectionately to all Friends at home & in Athy. I am &c
