There has been an injunction imposed
on me, I may say, a dying one, by John Doyle,
your Sisters husband, namely, to prove to you, by the most
incontrovertible facts, her unfeeling and unnatural conduct
towards him. I have heard of bad characters, but if the
annals of villany were ransacked, a character so foul - so
polluted by every species of abomination would not be
found amongst its gloomy catalogue. To you he appeals
for some small relief - if its denied him, endeavour, at least,
to illicit from his Son, a [underline]something[/underline], to relieve the author
of his existence. If his unnatural mother succeeded in instilling
into his mind the seed of disunion - if she has
led him to believe that his father had violated, in any
one instance, his fidelity as a husband, still, that
would not exonerate him, either in the eyes of [underline]God[/underline]
or man, from doing his [underline]duty[/underline], as his child. 'Tis true
that John Doyle had been visited by his [underline]wife[/underline] when
ill, that is, when he was in Benefit, but the moment
he ceased to be considered as an object of charity by

his Society, that moment his faithless wife ceased to come
near him. And what stamps her character as a still blacker
wretch is, that she purloined his last 1/2 Guinea (his Society
money) and two of his shirts, and when expostulated with
for so doing, she remarked, that an Hospital was the
fittest place for him. And Oh! if God is just (and
sure it would be blasphemy to deny it) why does he
[insertion]suffer[/insertion] such a monster to exist? or why does he suspend the
Thunderbolt of vengeance from crushing her to the earth?
Behold the husband of this [underline]being[/underline], lying on an earthen
floor - nothing separating his poor and emaciated body
from its frigid substance, save a sheaf of straw - no [underline]wife[/underline]
to soothe his agonized feelings - or child to assuage his
excruciating agony! - surrounded by individuals who
know him not, and whose carelessness and apathy, adds
but fuel to the fire of his sufferings. But the lamp
of life, in him, is nearly extinguished! the length of his
sufferings are nearly at a close! But, whilst a vestige
of life [deletion]yet[/deletion] remains - whilst his flittering [underline]soul[/underline] yet clings
to its earthly tenement, send him some relief lest his blood
remain at your door Show this Letter to his

Son, tell him a dying Father invokes his
bounty; and if complied with, he will give in
return - a Father's Blessing.
John Doyle.
PB. He remains where Mrs. Doyle [deletion]last[/deletion]
saw him last.
Mr. Doyle requests you and Andy to come to
See him as he thinks he is growing worse and
Would wish to see you before he is called
From this earth if this request be not complied
With [deletion][/deletion] the next application shall be to
