Oh Board Norma
My dear Mamma
Here we are safe
 & well, where we arrived yesterday
Evening about 9 O'Clock
but our Companion Mr Gowan
has not yet arrived, as he
did [insertion]not[/insertion] like to start as early as
 we did, as he wished to go
to Mass first, so we are
 watching for him, we had
a pleasant sail yesterday

& enjoyed the scenery very
much, When coming near this
place, Larne also was very
pretty- I am in hopes we
will now have fine weather
as both yesterday & today
are fine - we sent to look
for letters from you, but
the post will not be in,
untill this Evening, in consequence
of yesterday being
Sunday -- we were wishing
very much for Richd yesterday
Evening when we
were coming in here, it looked
so very beautiful, the day
before yesterday we made
an attempt to start, but
had to turn back for want
of wind, & fear of a fog, indeed
none of us ever had experienced
what a fog was, untill this
time, not even Mr. Gowan
had ever been so long in
it, we were about 24 hours
at one time that we could
scarcely see the length of

the vessel before us, but I
think we are quite out of
them now - there will
 [unclear]not[/unclear] be any use I suppose
in your writing here again
but I will keep this open
till I ask Manliff where
we will have the best chance
of hearing from you -
 M, says , you might write
a line on chance to Inverary
& also another
letter to Gourock, in haste
your much attached MJB
