My dear Sarah
I feel quite ashamed
that I have not got the butter
sent before this but be assured it
was not inattention to thy commission
for I had it pack'd since
the beginning of last week but was
disapointed by Kenagh going sooner
than I expected, however I hope
it is pretty fresh still as I kept it
in a cool place. - I received [unclear][/unclear]
acceptable letter by Theadore, [unclear][/unclear]
[unclear][/unclear] very kind of thee writing at [unclear][/unclear]
a hurried time - I have much
satisfaction in telling thee thy
dear Mother seems materially
better, she gets out every day in the
chaise and feels less fatigue after
it each day, her appetite is quite
good, and her limbs not near as
much swelled, her legs instead of
the cold unnatural feel they had
are now comfortably warm, I was
surprised the other- evening at feeling

[deletion]near as[/deletion] much easier got through
than I expected, and for a wedding
I think was pleasant. Mary
joins me in love to thee and the
little ones
thy very affectionate

heat even through the oil silk.
The last account of Lydia was favourable,
it mentioned her having walked
to Summerville, but I suppose thou
hast heard all this before.
I dare says thou hast seen poor Ellen
before this, I am limited for time
now or would tell thee particulars
of the wedding, but may [insertion]say[/insertion] it was [deletion]not[/deletion]
I heard something
of your coming to
Fullers Court for the
summer, is it so?
excuse mistakes
For Sarah
