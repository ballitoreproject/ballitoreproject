Anne Ken[deletion]n[/deletion]yons Visions
As many & grievous were the Bitter Potions, the Almighty in
the Days of my youth, caus'd me to drink, the Wormwood & the Gall, my Soul
hath it still in Remembrance, leading me thro many bitter Afflictions
up to his Holy Hill Sion, thro the inworking of that holy Power, raised
a Cry in me, Lord what wouldst thou have me to be, for being separated
from all outward Worship, I was one wandering in the World alone,
till when he had brought forth Judgement unto Victory, & in his own
time, made me what he wou'd have me to be not knowing, if any people
worshipped him in his own Way.
A Cry was raised in my Heart, who can shew me
any Good, being desirous to know if there were any People more
near to him than others, & he in his wonderful [insertion]mercies[/insertion] to the afflicted,
remembered me, for one Evening desiring much to know what his
Will & Mind, was, I had no sooner lay down than I was seized with
a Slumber, which was at that Time unusual to me, I was, as I thoug[insertion]ht[/insertion]
in a great Multitude of People by a River Side, but it was not the
River of God. There was of all Denominations or of those that bear
the outward Name to each Religion, Friends excepted; for none of
them I saw, there was a large Bridge built on the right Hand, over
which appeared three Angels coming Arm in Arm, their Robes
White, glittering exceedingly as if set with Precious Stones, their
countenance bright & lively as the sun shining in its full Strength,
one of them seemed to be a Woman supported by two young Men.
(Women's preaching before that I disbelieved) she beckoned with her
Hand for me to Advance toward her wch I immediately did, though
with great Fear & trembling & many of that Multitude advanced
likewise, but she told them with authority to keep their Distance
for she had nothing to say to them, her Message was to me, so being
commanded I drew nigh her who thus began, I am an Angel

sent Down by the Almighty to preach to the Inhabitants of the Earth but in
a more Particular Manner to that People called Quakers, who are a peculiar
People chosen by God himself, & for thy Sake am I sent to tell that
thy Prayers have reached the Almighty in his Holy Habitation, &
to tell thee that its his Will thou shou'd turn to him with all Speed
that can Possibly be, for no Way else thou can please him, at wch my
heart was exceedingly effected, it being away to the Kingdom I very much
disliked. Not duly considering that it was this Number who were willing
to become Fools for christs sake, that he was able to make wise unto Salvation,
the Angel seemed touched with my Sorrow, & with affection told me,
there was a great crown laid up for me in Heaven, but to obtain it there
was a hard work for me to do on the Earth, And she coud assure if I performed
that work with Faith & Patience as she doubted not in the least,
I shou'd enjoy that Crown of life wch shou'd never fade away; & she preached
as powerful, that I thought her Words wou'd have convinced the whole
World if present; thus awak'd; but the Dream was certain, & the Interpretation
sure, being lock'd as in a close Cabinet from the wise of this
World, but opened by him who hath the Key of David, who open's & none
can shut & when he shuts no Man in his Wisdom can open -
Betwixt two & three Years after this I was seized with
a violent Fever whereof all that saw me believ'd I shou'd resign my Spirit
to him that gave it; being one Evening brought near to Dearth, many
of my Friends & Neighbours were called to see me depart; I was
desirous to Die being well assured that my soul was hid with
Christ in God, & thought my Spirit left this Body & was taking
its flight to the blessed Regions above, Wherein the Vision of life,
I beheld a Glorious City, whose wall exceeded the polish'd Gold
the Gates of precious pearls exceeding the Light of the Sun being
enlightened by the lamb who dwelt therein, beholding it, my soul
longed to arrive thereat, but in my Way to it, I was met by two

shining ones, who tenderly embraced me, saying they were sent by the great
I [unclear]Jam[/unclear] to Welcome me so far on my Journey & at the same time to inform
me I was to Depart back from whence I came, for my Work was not yet
perfected & thus my Spirit returned & took up its Habitation again
in the Body, for what Time the Almighty in his own Wisdom
may see good for he not only Rules but by Ruling makes alive
& none can find their lives but such as are truly willing to lose
them for his Sake, who hath hitherto preserved me as a monument
of his Mercy, therefore may I live to sing his praises.
