My dear Richard,

	++++ Ye have heard no doubt of our dear friend Joseph Williams having uncovered his head, his anointed head, in the religious assemblies in Dublin. My heart was glad when I heard itAnd the desire of my spirit is that many more may, in all humility & prostration of self, wait in the deeps, each keeping to their own peculiar exercise, till they receive qualification & ability to bring up their several stones of memorial, living stones, polished & fitted in the depths from which they are brought. I have seen many sweet & promising blossoms, fair & fragrant, from which delicious fruits might have been expected in due seasonmany hopeful youths of both sexes, whom the Lord has been graciously pleased to visit, & to open an eye in them to see the beauty & excellence which is in the Truth, & to view this world as it really is,but there has not been a following on to know the Lord in progressive stages of advancementthere has not been a sufficiently diligent waiting for the ^re-^ baptizing power which purges & makes clean from all defilement of flesh & spirit, nor for the re-anointing which keeps the internal eye open & clear to see things natural, & things spiritual in the proper lightso there is a dwelling dwindling, a decaying & a dwarfishness in staturea deficiency in measure & weight& the vacant seats of the princes & nobles, removed from works & ^[pencil] to^ rewards, [page number] 184 are not effectually filled upso that defect & weakness have overspread; the dignity of the church is towered, & his ^her^ authority, which stands in the life & in the power of Truth, is greatly diminishedIf ye are persuaded that these things are so, my dear Richard, do thou & some of thy near connexions look about you, & see whereabouts you arelet not the uses cares of this life supersede your interested concern in those things, which relate to a better that is to comeWhile ye are commendably & moderately diligent in outward business, be diligent & 
fervent in spirit, serving the Lord & his cause with your best in your generation. Above all things fell after after the dew of heaven, & as much of the fatness of the earth as is suitable for you will be added. Let the pure Truth & its heavenly wisdom circumscribe your desires & designs in all thingsyou ^will^ find its government & direction most profitable, both as to the life, which now is, & that which is to come.
	thy truly affectionate
		Richard Shackleton
