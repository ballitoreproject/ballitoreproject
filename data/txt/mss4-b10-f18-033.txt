Larne July 28th
On board the Norma
My dear Mamma
As the weather &
wind was contrary to our crossing
to Scotland we came up the
Coast here from Belfast, we
made an attempt to start
today, but had no wind, so
are waiting till we get a chance
to cross to Scotland, but I
write to tell you we are all
quite well, but we have had

very foggy bad weather however
I hope it may improve
now - Manliff desires his
love & to ask you to tell
Arthur, to send [underline]a pound[/underline]
to Christie's wife, and 14
shillings to George's, & if
we are not home before
the following Saturday, he
wishes him to do the same
again - I cant write more
at present than that I am
your much attached MJB -
I hope we may soon hear from
you when we get across -
we cannot tell yet, which
it is to Campbelton or
Gourock we will get first,
but I hope you will write
to both - and that we
may have a good account
of you all - please say
if you heard any thing of
my poor Invalid Mary -
