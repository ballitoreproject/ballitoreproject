but it was too distant for our limited
time to admit of [deletion]I[/deletion] our going
to [underline]it[/underline]. So having traversed the
pretty walks we returned to the house
where after awhile we had a very
comfortable snack - (-) is the
most amiable young man I ever
met I really do think -
After this the Doctor brought us
out to see his thrashing machine
and then we took a pleasant
walk until the cars over=took us
Then in we packed again and
returned by another and shorter
road - The evening was a beautiful
one and most unusually mild
for this time of year -
Well! Charlie and Patrick
had arrived as I expected, and
seem I am sorry to say rather
disappointed in the place - They
are already beginning to think it stupid
Can't be helped - I know [underline]I[/underline] dont,
Miss Fanny sung us some songs
