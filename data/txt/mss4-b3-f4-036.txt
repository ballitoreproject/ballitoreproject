Cork 5th 12th month 1790

My dear friend

	Thou hast doubtless ^heard^ of our beloved S:R:Gs illness and wilt I believe be, with many more, anxious about her. It is hoped she is better, but no material alteration is looked for till 3d or 4th day next. I thought before this family visit was began that it might have ^been^ a while delayed till this dear friend should, if permitted, grow better, that so S: Lees and I might attend her, but she was unwilling to hinder the work so insisted on S:Ls leaving ^her^. However yesterday afternoon we went up there ^to Springmount^, I staid till late, could not conveniently to that family lodge with them but S. L. staid to be with her all night. She was there another night since the visit began, but it seems too trying even ^to^ her strength to labour as she does in the day and nurse at night. We were [?] suffered to see dear S:R:G. on account of her extreme weakness, and the Physician tries to prevent her talking as he says by doing so the cold air gets to her lungs and they seem much affected, her cough very troublesome, it seems to shake her whole poor, pained, sore frame. I was one of the favoured few who got to her last evening. She desired I would talk, that my talk would not hurt her, and was as always ^as^ heretofore affectionately kind. She mentioned haveing [sic] had a letter from thee, and said as thou wast such a Father to us she wished me to tell thee how she was  which I told her I intended to do, and as I found she was not inclined to be silent I told ^her^ I was fearful I should be blamed about her, and when her husband came to her bed-side I slipped away. Hearing after that she enquired several times for me I went up stairs again and sat a while silently by ^her^ she holding my hand. I thought it was a favour to be near her  at length she said she wished to send thee a few sentences and desired I might get a Pencil & write which I did she expressed herself with difficulty, & some words [illegible] to say, I believe, she did not articulate, but I endeavoured to be as faithful a scribe as I could, gave her all my attention, and mean to transcribe her words on the other side. When she had done I desired her to try to be still & be 
composed, she said, she was not less composed than when she began, but I meant to try to rest  Cousin Robert and Joshua Beale are much with her  all the family at Springmount thou mayst be sure very attentive to her  Sarah Hatton is also confined to her bed, an inflammation on her lungs seems apprehended. Edward was with us in the families till yesterday, that he could not be [illegible] stay from home. Joshua White is the only man friend beside whose company we have had, he & Edward seem well furnished for the work, as does Loveday Allen. Rachel Davis is mostly with us. S: Lees manifests, i think, that ^it^ is right she should be here. As to poor me I can say little, but that suffering & deep trials seem my lot, however I am not, by anything I have professed, bound to go on, and I endeavour not to look much forward and ^but^ to do as well as I can. My health is in a state not suited for such work, but I am favoured to keep about as well as I came  We have sat with 12 families 
Springmount 1st day afternoon. I came here directly from 1st meeting to leave S:L at liberty to go to 2d: Dear S:R:G. is very weak, her ^heads^ a little discomposed, I think, by opiates, but she lies sweet & still, I write in her chamber having this precious ^charge^ during meeting time. Thou may say my writing [illegible] to hy eyes  excuse me & my materials & let dear Mary read. My heart salues her in affectionate sympathy, and you all. Samuel Neale sends dear love, and desires you may know that E. Penroses children are all well over the small-pox. We and Sarah are pretty well. Dear S:R:G said to me just ^now^ I am pretty well if I can be content to be nothing for I seem to have no sense, no knowledge nor no strength. There was handed to me after meeting a very grateful salutation from thee. Continue if thou canst thy good desires ^for me^. I feel at present satisfied that I am here, and I believe ought to be thankful but I am encompassed with ^weakness^ & infirmity. Great is the condescension t ome! My lodging at ^my^ Aunt Pikes is very agreeable  the dear girls I believe love me. I intended to have left dear S:R:Gs part entire not to have scribbled on it, but attending to her causes me to make many mistakes. Dearly farewell  E. Pim

I have but a scrap of time from affecting [?] use [?] of this kind [illegible]  no very material change since yesterday in SRG but what there is I fear is not for the better  she is very low I have to say
Wilt thou kindly mention whether my Nephew Js. [?] Harvey is quite well when thou writes me  his fond Mother has had needless fear I suppose about his throat Thy J.A

S:F:G. to R:S
	When I heard thy salutation read my mind was convinced that it sprang from the deep & immortal spring ground of religious sympathy, for the baptism into which my mind has been introduced since I returned home, could not have been ministered to, but from so sacred an unction: It met me, though apparently out of course, in the right time, and being under impressions which make time & circumstances of little account, composed with the unlimited consolations of the spirit or a preparation to receive them at the Divine hand. My Soul though encompassed with manifold infirmities of a very afflicted tabernacle can feelingly worship & rejoice in nothing more than this, that the Lamb immaculate is still redeeming by his precious blood out of every nation, kindred, tongue & people, and making a glorious audition to the Church triumphant whose names will stand eternally recorded in the book of Life. I express not these things from a redundancy of Heavenly virtue but from the Soul sustaining evidence that amidst all our weakness & conflicts of flesh or spirit, an interest is mercifully granted in Him who giveth the victory over Death, Hell, & the [seal torn]
I have been afflicted beyond what I can describe since I came to [seal torn] Cork, but the violence of the storm is a little abated since last [seal torn] hope is, may be, whether increase or decrease remains wisely amongst the hidden things  As I am not able to dictate much more I leave the particulars of my illness to be more fully related by my dear ^beloved^ E:P  who, with dear S. Lees, are here on a great & good work. They will I hope often find their capacities often renewed to draw water out of the wells of Salvation. Their being detained in Cork at this time is a comfort to me even when I do not see them. For the works sake they have to oppose a strong draught ^draft^ [both words left] of natural affection in ministering to a sister in affliction
