Limerick 9th Month 12th 1818.
Dear Sarah,
The last letter I received from
thee, & I fear the last I ever shall receive from
thee was dated the 18th of 7th Month. In one part
of it thou expresst a fear that I should not be
able to make [underline]head or tail[/underline] of it; but I have since
been sorry to find that I am obliged to make a [underline]tail[/underline]
of it, as it is the termination of the [underline]body[/underline] of thy letters
to me. I need not ask any questions in this letter,
it being a final one.
I shall now give thee an account of a very agreeable
excursion which I took this week. Last third day about half
after 10 o'clock, I left this in company with my uncle Dawson
& Harvey & Benjamin Fisher in a steam-packet which
plies between this & Kilrush, a small town near the mouth
of the Shannon about 45 miles distant from Limerick. We
went a good part of the way against wind & tide. We arrived
at Kilrush about 6 in the evening. We dines, drank tea
at Kilrush about 6 in the evening. We dined, drank tea
& lodged at a magnificent hotel near Kilrush; & the
time spent in this house was the most unpleasant of
the whole, as we were obliged to take our meals in the
presence of strangers more accustomed to state & ceremony
than ourselves, which always appears extremely irksome
to me, who most heartily detest ceremony. Next morning,

the four of us set off in a sociable belonging to the hotel, to
Kilkee, a small watering place on the western coast of the
county Clare about 7 miles distant. The country was most uninteresting.
Scarcely a [deletion]ta[/deletion] tree to be seen, the soil was
chiefly bog, interspersed with patches of green oats. However
I was well recompensed for the want of interest in this
short journey by the sight of the majestic Atlantic at
Kilkee. The sea was rather rough & I was in raptures
at [insertion]view of[/insertion] the tremendous foaming billows lashing as it were
with anger the proud & rugged rocks, & then [deletion]rising in upon[/deletion]
the spray rising to the height of many feet. It was
with difficulty I could be brought to leave it when it
was time to return home. However before we went, my
uncle Dawson, Ben Fisher & I took a dip in a little
rocky nook, which although it [deletion]only[/deletion] received but a slight
share of the effect of the waves, was so much agitated by
them as to have thrown us down, had we not held a rock
while the surges were rolling over our heads. In the course
of this day Byron's grand address to the ocean at the conclusion
of his fourth canto of Childe Harold frequently occurred
to me. Thou canst see it in the last Edinburgh Review.
We returned home in the evening to the Kilrush hotel, where
we dined, drank tea & lodged. We set off next morning at 6
in the same sociable for Miltown another watering place on
the same coast, about 15 miles from Kilrush. The morning
was calm & delightful, enlivened by the beams of the
newly-risen sun. We arrived at Miltown about 10. when we
immediately bathed again in the ocean, which was much calmer

than the day before, & then went to breakfast. After breakfast
we went out to walk, which we continued to do until near 4 o'clock
when we left it, & arrived in Kilrush about 8. [deletion]I no me[/deletion]
We then dined, immediately after which, we felt, after the
fatigues of the day, very glad to resign ourselves into the arms
of Morpheus. The next morning, which was yesterday, the
most delightful which we had since we went, we left Kilrush
in the Steam-packet about half after 9, & arrived after
a very agreeable sail in Limerick at 3. On coming home,
I [deletion]re[/deletion] found a letter for me from thy mother, which was
very acceptable. - My uncle, aunt & Mary Dawson intend
going home on second day, they do not go by way of Dublin,
& consequently, not through Ballitore. - Reuben Harvey
lately had a letter from Jacob (last first-day) which
I have not seen. The only news that I heard from
it was that last summer was most oppressively hot
in America, & Jacob suffered very much from it; but is
now pretty well. - I was very much pleased with the account
thy mother gives me of Joseph Fayle. I intend [unclear][/unclear]
write to him to-day. - I am now drawing near the close
of my letter, & of our correspondence, which has lasted for about
three quarters of a year. As long as it did last, it has been
a very great source of gratification & I believe of instruction
to me; & for those reasons I cannot but feel &
lament the loss of it in future. However, I must say,
that I feel grateful for the favour of being allowed
to correspond with thee even for so short a time, & I heartily
thank thee for the letters which thou [underline]hast[/underline] written to
me, & which I intend for ever to keep, as memorials of
our friendship. This appears to me almost like parting with
a friend whose company I began to relish; but when I should

never see again. In future, I must value thy personal
presence more than ever, & reap all the advantages I can
from it, [deletion]as[/deletion] [insertion]since[/insertion] I am [deletion]hitherto debarred[/deletion] hereafter to be debarred
from the enjoyment of thy epistolary society. Although henceforward
I shall not have the pleasure of considering myself
thy correspondent, I still have one pleasure left,
that of being
thy faithful, constant sincere &
affectionate friend.
"Farewell! a word that must be, & hath been -
A sound which makes us linger; - yet - farewell!"
Thomas Fisher.
