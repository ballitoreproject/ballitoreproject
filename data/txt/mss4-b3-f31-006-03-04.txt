My dear cousin Sally,


        I thought it might be agreeable to thee to receive a line from me, and therefore put pen to paper, though hardly expecting any thing [sic] to turn up worthy of thy acceptance +++ I am (thank Providence) favoured with health  my companions also hold out bravely ^+^ +++ I was disappointed at not getting a letter from home to-day  I have a soft place in me  I wanted to know how my beloved wife, my beloved M.S. and my beloved S.H. were  It is very grateful to me when abroad to receive intelligence from home. I put a letter in the post-office ^here^ yesterday-morning for our dear M.S  My heart has been in trepidation about her  I want to learn the lesson of resignation  Mayest thou, my dear Sally, be instructed in it, so as that thou mayst be enabled to say, Come life, come death, thy will be done, O Lord! Happy beyond ^human^ conception, happy are those, whose warfare is accomplished, whose iniquity is pardoned, and who have received at the Lords hand double for all their sins  who, conscious of their own demerits and absolute insufficiency, throw themselves entirely on upon the mercy of their great Judge, and patiently, and submissively, and resignedly wait till their change come  that glorious change, which will be from mortality to immutability ^immortality^  and from [page number] 250 temporary pain and sorrow to everlasting joy and peace  May this, my beloved cousin Sally, be thy experience, saith thy very affectionate kinsman, truly sympathizing and faithful friend  Give my cordial love to thy dear sister  Send my kind salutation to my wife, and to the rest of them at both houses. ++ I suppose thou may get this on first-day-morning  Though I may probably see thee next day, yet as I thought it might perhaps cheer thee, I was willing, if in my power, to make thee glad by a letter +++ Farewell, my dear, dear child,  may the best, and only effectual consolation be thine, now and for every.
        R. S.
