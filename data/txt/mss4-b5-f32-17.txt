Anner Mills, 6th of 3rd month 1822
My dear friend,
This afternoon brought me thy kind
& interesting epistle, for which I am truly grateful
particularly so because thy attention is called to an
important event. I should not now trespass on thy
time but that thou mayst feel disappointed in not
being successful with the little parcel directed
to my brother J N. R's care for Mary Richardson. he
left us on 2nd day, & intended to drop a few lines in Athy
containing an extract from my Aunt Hannah, which
I hope thou hast received. we had a high treat of my dear
brother's company for nearly a week. I dare say that
his Anna is well pleased to have him safely out
of this turbulent country.. the illegal associations
seem to have spread & become general & serious
'tis time our poor country folk have grievances
of which [underline]Tythes[/underline] may be termed the chief - but we do
not perceive that they confine their dreadful outrage
within these limits.. The lives of their fellow [unclear]creatures[/unclear]
are of small account, and it is dreadful to
contemplate that blood is become so familiar. [unclear]My[/unclear]
valued Aunt Courtenay is increasingly feeble, her
son John has lost his little girl by a mysterious complaint
in the arm, which puzzled her medical attendants -
Ah! dear Anne Doyle, it is a fine thing to be
[unclear]prepared[/unclear].. her affectionate sister is an object of sympathy
she has however no husband, or little innocents.
to feel her loss.. a fine friend has been snatched
from a tender husband, and a numerous acquaintance
in the prime of life & usefulness. Henry Newman's
wife of Peckham near London. she had been fourteen
years married, [insertion]when[/insertion] [deletion]and[/deletion] a little unexpected stranger promised
an increase of happiness, as with our beloved Princess
the poor mother suffered long protracted agony. the boy lived

about 8 hours, but in defiance of the efforts of 4 Physicians
the suffering patient expired. E Dudley staid to close her
eyes - & then went to her brother Williams wife, then in labor
she had a trying time of 34 hours. When they were presented
with a little girl. who with its mother were doing
well when we heard - we hope to gain Dinah Whites
company tomorrow. I am obliged by the mentions of our [underline]poor[/underline]
Edward - he is very well tho' not so fit as some weeks
ago - Jane has commissioned me with very dear love
to thy Elizabeth, & Joseph desires his to Sally White
mine is most cordially to each of my much loved
friends, whom I hope never to forget. thy obliged
E. Clibborn
