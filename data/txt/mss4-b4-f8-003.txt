Endeared Fr: A: S.
If I had known how to direct to thee
I had probably wrote to thee ere now,
having therefore this opportunity per my Worthy Frd. J. E.
thou mayest hereby understand that our Family and
Meeting are (thro' Mercy) generally well, & that thou art
not forgotten by us, but thy name and Memory lives
secretly among us, if ever thou thought otherwise thou
mistook: I would not have had any thing but Death to
have parted thee and Me; My respects to thee were and
are without discrimination, for that good Principle of Honesty
Innocency, & Sincerity, which I know dwell (& hope dwells
and desire may ever dwell) in thee.
I had wrote thee a little farewell Epistle which I
hoped would have reached thee before thou hadst left Todmerden,
but 'twas too late.
