Lisburn April 24th 1812
My dear friend
The poor in this town are so much
distressed that we are endeavouring to have a
soup shop established, and [insertion] as[/insertion] I have heard that
you have an excellent method of making soup
for the poor at Ballitore, may I request thee to
send me a copy of the receipt, please also say at
what price the soup can be sold per quart. We
have been making experiments in making rice
meat for the poor, & according to the receipt given
in a late number of the Belfast Magazine, excellent
food can be sold to the poor at 1d per pound, as
one pound of rice prepared according to that receipt
produces [underline]nearly [/underline]seven pounds of food. It is
intended to [underline]sell [/underline] the soup & rice meat to the poor,
as they seldom prize food which is given gratis ;
but money is distributed every week to poor house
keepers, & to beggars on condition that they give
up their habits of mendicity, & employ themselves
at some useful work.
We had a very short visit from Thomas
Haughton; we are quite angry at his short visit
[deletion][/deletion]. He has not had time to see some of

The finest scenery in the North. I hope we shall
be able to persuade Betsy Shackleton to come to
see us in the summer. I am anticipating great
pleasure from her visit.
Joseph Lancaster has paid another visit
to Belfast; he did not seem to like his journey
to Munster. He paid high compliments to the
inhabitants of Belfast.
The proprietors of the Belfast Magazine
have received many little packets from thee;
some of the papers are to appear in the next
magazine. The sketch of Clonmel is very much
admired. Since I last wrote to thee one
of the Belfast booksellers promised to pay me
for the Anecdotes, & I intend sending him some
more to sell. I am sorry that the cottage
Dialogues are not more generally known in
this country. I believe there is not a single
copy of either the English or Irish edition to be
sold in Belfast. I think it would be well to
get the London & Dublin publishers of the Dialogues
to send some copies to the Belfast booksellers
in case of a new edition of the Dialogues,
or if thee should publish more. I would recommend.

Sam.l Archer as the best bookseller. Ward is
a more fashionable one, but he does not like
paying money as long as he can avoid it.
I wish much to hear about Ballybarny;
are the houses & gardens kept as neat as they
were? If your endeavours to improve the
poor have succeeded, it would be worth trying
the experiment in other places.
I wish to write more, but [insertion] as [/insertion] I have my
housekeeping affairs to arrange before I can
attend our little school, I must only add that
I am with dear love to Betsy Shackleton, Eliz.
[unclear]Deborah[/unclear] &c &c most sincerely thy affectionate
S [unclear]Hancock[/unclear]
I should be much obliged to thee to let me
hear from thee respecting the soup.
