Sarah Haughtons dream 8 mo 1787
I dreamed I was in our yard with my brother and sister and several
others and that I saw a Comet just over the Meeting-house; it's head was
like a very large bright star, and it's tail of the colour and clearness of
Amber. I was greatly delighted with so beautiful an object, and
thought I would keep my eye on it as long as I could- it directed its
course over our house, and past a little beyond it. I asked my Sister
if such sights were common- she replied they were sometimes
seen in America on particular occasions- and added Cousin
Aby Shackleton has told us of [underline]this[/underline] some days since I thought it
occurred to me not to attribute [underline]this[/underline] to natural causes for it was
probably a mark of Divine approbation or displeasure. Still I
kept watching it, as it hoverd back and forward over the house,
and could perceive it grow larger [deletion]and larger[/deletion] and larger increasing
also in brightness till the atmosphere seem'd in a glow; at length
I thought it assumed a human shape and descended gradually till
I could distinguish the lower part of the face from the nose upward
being concealed it would be almost impossible to conceive any thing [insertion]more[/insertion]
perfictly lovely than what I saw of it; the smile of benignity
and peace which was diffused over it I believe I shall ever
remember. I called to my Sister several times to observe it- as
it descended nearer to us, I could hardly bear the excessive brightness
which surrounded it, the lower part of it being as [insertion]it[/insertion] were richly
studded with a variety of precious stones. I wished greatly
to know for what purpose we were favoured with so extraordinary
an appearance- when it came so near as almost to
touch my head- I felt as if I was in a blaze of brightness
and I as instantly awoke in a situation of mind which cannot
be described, and which I wish I may never forget

I lay awake perhaps some hours astonished at the clearness which was
manifested in every particular, and humbled into a sense if my own
nothingness and ingratitude for the many favours dispensed to
[underline]us[/underline] by a bountiful Providence; when I again fell asleep and I
thought I saw my Father, who said it was not [insertion]a[/insertion] dream as I imagined,
but an appearance which many people had seen
Their are many little particulars which I have omitted
She departed this life the 20 of 8 [insertion]mo[/insertion] 1789
