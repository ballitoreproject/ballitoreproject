15th.. Uncle Manliffe better. Gabe Fisher to dinner.
15th.. First day, Charlie Avy and I went to
meeting this morning. It was Papa's
turn to go, but he had such a cold, he
thought it better to stay at home -.
so I went again to day. After meeting
we called at Glendruid bringing Aunt Elizabeth
and I Florence that far on the car. Heard
Uncle Manliffe was better. We had all to
be as quiet as mice almost, as [deletion]he[/deletion] the
least noise they said could be heard by
him. I am very glad he is better. On
[insertion]the car[/insertion] Charlie and I were talking about the
meanings of different words. when I
asked him [deletion]the[/deletion] for his idea of the meaning
of the word 'holiness', he [insertion]immediately[/insertion] held out his
hand displaying a glove through the
finger ends of which his finger tops
were appearing - . We had Gabe
Fisher for dinner with plenty of
chat - fresh from his travels in
Switzerland where he met Uncle
October.
