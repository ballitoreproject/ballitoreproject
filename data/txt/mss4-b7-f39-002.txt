My dear Mary, love for thee invites me to send thee a
few lines, Abby is growing better as fast as we cd expect -
I am not stout in body, yet my mind at times a little
more severe than when I saw thee last, bitter medicine
is - or sometimes very wholsome this outward bustle & stir
about [insertion]outside[/insertion] religion, drives the poor toss'd mind to [insertion]seek[/insertion]the fountain
of pure inward religion, so I find it at times, tho indeed one
[insertion]might[/insertion] wonder if even this good can be derived from it. my Joe has
been poorly with a painful swell'd jaw, his patience has made
it tolerable to me, thou might have mention'd thy [underline]lambs[/underline]
farewell dr. Mary I am affectionately thy frd M White
my pen wd scarcely write (turn)

a Cool Nutter
Ri, wk 62th. a 72. L 1:18.9
hope may go safe, & please - soon as
conveniant return the Vessell for its
owner -
