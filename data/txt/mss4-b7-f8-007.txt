Dear Molly,
I beg remision for my neglect
in writing soon enough but
I wrote some of the story before Sally
sent the bag but she is so rigid
a Post-mistress that I dare not
ask her to neglect the Bag for
one Day itself & thou so impatient
a girl that thou wouldst fall in
a passion. I beg to be excused for
my freedom.
I think I have no thin[deletion]k[/deletion]g
(I made such a mistake here as
thou in Sally Haughton's letter)
remarkable to enlarge my
letter & so must unwilly bid
Adieu
W. Rayner

Dialogue 4th.
Neptune & the Nereids.
Nep: Indeed this sea, into which the girl fell, shall be called
Hellespont from her. But you, Nereids, having received the
dead carcase carry it to Tr[deletion]oy[/deletion]oas that it may be burned by
the inhabitants. Ner: No, no, Neptune, but let it be buried
here in the [deletion][unclear][/unclear]sea[/deletion]sea that bears her name; for we pity her suffering[deletion]s[/deletion]
[deletion]from her[/deletion] most miserable, [insertion]things from her[/insertion] step mother. Nep: This indeed Amphitrite
is not lawfull. Nor is it decent that she should by here any
longer under the sand, but what I said she shall be buried
in Troas in Cherronesus but this shall be satisfaction to her that
a little after this I no shall suffer the same & being pursued by Athamas
shall fall into the sea from the top of Mount Cithaeron which stretch
forth in the sea, having her oon in her arms. Ner: But thou shouldst
save her to gratify Bacchus for I no was his nourisher & nurse. Nep: I
ought not to save such a wicked person But it does not become[deletion]s[/deletion]
Amphitrite, to displease Bacchus. N. But what made her fall from
the ram for her brother Phrixus was carried safe.. Nep. Deservedly
for he was young & could stand against the attack but she after
she had mounted the in[deletion]g[/deletion]credible machine & had looked upon
the deep sea from the strangeness of the thing being affrighted
& at the same time being affected with stupidity & seized with a
dizziness from the force of the flight became unable to hold the
horns of the ram which each of them held & fell into the sea. Ner.
Ought not her mother Nephele help her falling. Nep. She ought
but [deletion]the[/deletion] Fate is much more powerful than Nephele.
