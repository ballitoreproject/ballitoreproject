My beloved M.D.
	I have just now treated myself with the re-perusal of thy last letter, & (some how) relish it even better than when it was first served to me  so may all our communications be, not flattening & insipid, but increasing in savour, to mutual edification & refreshment? I find, my dear friend, thou art still poorly in health, sick & weakly, perhaps both in body & mind, cumbered with cares and children, oppressed with manifold burdens, several of thy intimate friends separated & secluded from thee by various means, & one choice, kindred spirit (from whose society thou probably expected occasional help & comfort) withdrawn entirely & for ever from the field of labour. Thus art thou dealt with, & thus it pleases the Author of all that is good, continuedly to wean thee from an attachment to the creatures, to visible objects, to lower enjoyments, to subordinate helps, to subduct from under thee every other prop & stay, & to rivet thy attention, expectation, hope & confidence, to, from & in him alone. I wish I had it for thee  but I am not worthy to comfort thee - & thou knowst where are hid all the fresh springs of effectual, divine consolation. Thou hast always been the favoured subject of the merciful regard, & protection & care of Him that made thee, who sent thee into life, gave thee a name among his people, & honoured thee with a part in his service - & while thou diligently, simply & faithfully feelst after the motion of the inward, heavenly life, & walkst & actst in obedience thereto, there is no doubt but that thou wilt continue to be helped over one mountain & difficulty after another, & through every strait, till the

last strait comes, through which thou wilt also be belped, & come into a large place, where all the glorious prospects of which thou had hast now & then ^had^ a glimpse here for thy revival & encouragement, will be realized in the full, uninterrupted everlasting enjoyment. +++
	Thy guests I.W. & children spent last First day with us  I suspect that I  did not do as he ought to have done in the forenoon-meeting, & that he was not so happy & comfortable in himself afterwards. This is a pity; for Master is a good Master - & if he orders a servant to do a turn, or go an errand, he does not mean that it should be at the servants charge  he furnishes (though perhaps sometimes frugally) for the business, & his pay is good & sure. I suppose our dear E.P. & SL are going on with the family visit in Cork  the removal of our beloved & honoured S.R.G. from before their eyes, while they were engaged in that service there, & the continuing in the service must have been a very awful dispensation to them. If thou be able to write to E.P., do write  if not, pray for her when thou art able. Our dear Margaret too has been deeply tried with domestick events, besides her share in the publick loss  May she be favoured to centre in humble resignation, & to bless the hand who gives & takes away! +++
Farewell, & remember for good, when thou canst
thy poor, affectionate friend
