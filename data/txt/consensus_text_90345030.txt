tempted to so again
with him or any

be the boys. Charlie
came out for me
and slipping quietly
out of the room I
got away almost

[deletion][unclear]altho'[/unclear][/deletion] all the way in
so had enough of
exercise, for one day
I think. the girls
I think. The girls
I mean Maria and
Josephine returned to
Sanford.
