Harry Fisher's death.
1st Sixth day. Papa and Mama went
to town early, and Avy by the eleven
o'clock train, so that I have the house
pretty much to myself.
9 O'clock. Only Avy came out this evening,
ing, bringing sad news. Poor Harry
Fisher died some months ago of Apoplexy
quite suddenly. It was only to day
this sad news, came, in a letter from
[deletion][unclear]Alfred [deletion][/deletion][insertion]W H Waroney[/insertion], Oh poor Aunt Liddy! What
a blow to her. And Elizabeth is I believe
no better, they are very anxious about her.
Joe Strangman too is ill and has come
up to town to consult the doctors, he
is to come out to-morrow with Mama.
Oh this is a gloomy time, a cloud
has come over us, but behind I trust
the sun [insertion]still[/insertion] shines. "Be still sad voice
and cease repining"
Behind the clouds is the sun still shining"
Oh poor Aunt Liddy!
December
