Rostrevor July 22nd
On board Norma
1860
My dear Mama
We are just after
arriving here quite safe, we
left Kingstown harbor about
1/2 past 4 this morning and
arrived here about 3 today
a very quick passage, Considering
we had a strong head wind
against us the whole time,
and a heavy sea, the reason

which decided Manliff on
coming in here before he
goes farther; is, that Charlie's
wife & Erasmus suffered so
much from sea sickness,
we think it better to rest
a day or two here, & perhaps
we may get a more favorable
wind, & then the sick people
would not suffer so much -
in fact nothing could be
more patient than they
both were, & are now quite
enjoying the thoughts of their
dinner, Charles was only a
 little ill -- Manliff bids me
ask you or Margaret to write
by [underline]return[/underline] of post & we think
we will get it before we leave
this, of course direct Post Office
Rostrevor - with love [underline]from all[/underline]
[underline]to all[/underline] believe me your much
attached MJB
