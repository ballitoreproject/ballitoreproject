1828
My dear Elizth As Franks pass between
us I need not be afraid of sending my
economy abroad, the present news
is that J Williams only waits command
to go to her new situation house keeper
to the [unclear][/unclear][unclear][/unclear] institution at Claremont
[unclear][/unclear] father & mother propose taking E Gough
to board & lodge for Â£20 per ann. EG is
rejoiced, this seems much better
than boarding herself she is still
with Eben & Deb. S Pim is anxious
to leave her present abode & take
my aunt Lydia's house next to J Whites
those are we going to lose a tenant
I hope, to find one as good if any
one in the North incline to come
here thou art at liberty to give
every one [unclear][/unclear]
I wish I could meet the on the
stairs at JB's or in thy own room
with a pair of troisers in my hand
& if any thing superfluous appears
I might take it away with me for my
pains.
Mr. Fisher barely mention'd
Agnes's death in so abrupt a
manner that we fear'd telling
my mother till we should hear
of other particulars. my mother
has written to Lockard
who I think will communicate
what he has heard of her
poor thing I dont think she
was so [unclear]regrateful[/unclear].-
So SB writes to thee, is it
by post? We all strive
to persuade EG to write to
her mother but for causes
unknown to us she declined
doing so I wish she had written
immediately on her arrival
here it would have been very

told how she got on, & quite
natural, she said her mother
did not wish her to write she
believed,
A few weeks ago a letter
came here directed to Betty
Doyle with an inclosure,
[deletion][/deletion] the tailor's daughter Betty
Doyle came and got the letter
& brought it back to me [deletion]to day[/deletion]
[deletion]in[/deletion] a [deletion]few[/deletion] day[deletion]s[/deletion] after open & the
inclosure also open which
was a letter to Lucy Obrien
from her sweetheart wishing
of all things to marry & as Lucy
could not read the letter was
sent to Betty Doyle ([unclear]Winny[/unclear]) to
read for her. Well said I why
did thee open Lucy's letter,
"Oh miss it was Mary Dempsy
did it", I cant read writing" -
to day I sent word to Betty
Doyle ([unclear]Winny[/unclear]) that there was
a letter for her, fearing another
mistake, she sent for it open'd
& sent it back saying it was
for the tailors daughter, & so
it was, from her sweetheart
saying that the old proverb
was reversed with him
"Out of sight [insertion]out[/insertion] of mind, " for
she was always in his
mind; so I think the young
Lady was very well served
for letting Mary Dempsy
open Lucy's letter, "A comedy
of errors" says thee
Sally Barrington has
hea[insertion]r[/insertion]d of a situation in
Dublin & goes early this [unclear][/unclear]
hast thou any commands?

3 women in search of work to
better their condition [unclear][/unclear]

over an hospital I hope not
of incurables, I must go to bed

Barrenstown sang together very
well & then they got Fanny
with a very sweet voice
to sing Robin Adair

& Henry sang for them
[unclear]Elvia[/unclear] upon her word [unclear][/unclear]
sung Jane Wms was invited
but her spirits after her
disappointment were in no
order to appear in public so
she spent the evening at
M & AD's, the night before
the Goodmans gave a party
quite unknown to JW -
the Coxes [insertion]comprised of[/insertion] Butlers & Farmers
great Dancing I hear but
they [deletion]good[/deletion] could not get
Fitsimmons's [unclear]baker[/unclear] to play
the fiddle for them so I dont

by asking him to come & play
for them who return'd answer
that he was a tradesman & only
