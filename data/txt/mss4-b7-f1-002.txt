My dear Mrs. Leadbeater/
I return you many
thanks for your Kind Letter of the
25th ult. but cannot say how much
I feel for the decline of my old, Honest,
worthy friend. J Chandlee, and his
Wife, I assure you my thoughts wander
much many times when I find the
most religious, the most Honest, &
the most industrious in the World,
[underline]not[/underline] prosper (among the few I have
met of [underline]that[/underline] description, the two I
mention are [unclear]ferment[/unclear]) when the
most profligate, &c. &c. know nothing
but prosperity, and affluence; pray
make my most affect. regards acceptable

acceptable to that worthy pair, &
I make no doubt they will both
find in the next World what they
have [underline]so well[/underline] [unclear]invited[/unclear]in this ungrateful
wicked World: I shou'd have been
glad to have heard something more
particular of my old friend your
Brother, and his good Wife, what [underline]he[/underline]
is doing &c. &c. if he attends [underline]at all[/underline]
to the School, and who the[unclear]White[/unclear]
is that you say conducts it now.
I wish to be inform'd when it is
kept, what number, & description
of Boys are there, and how soon
I might expect Boys of my good
talents to enter College, from it,
beginning the Classics, if French
& Dancing is taught, and the
terms; all this [deletion][/deletion] I make no
doubt my friend Mrs. Leadbeater will

will have the kindness to inform
me when she is perfectly at leisure,
I must not tell you I am, and ever
shall be much attached to Ballitore
where I spent so many happy days,
& I shou'd be delighted to have my
Boys there if circumstances will
[unclear]amt.[/unclear] and that any of my own old
friends are concern'd; when is your
Brothers' eldest Son? I left more
than one fishing Rod, but no
tackle, and a Book, [unclear]beside[/unclear] the
one of prints you mention, but
suppose they must have been
lost, which I regret; as to the
Sofa seat I had it for a pillow
during the [unclear]Batallion[/unclear], & you may
dispose of it now as you please,
the other articles I hope soon
to have call'd for to you, &
return you many thanks for
your care of them: With best

best, and kindest regards, and
wishes for you, your Husband,
& family, believe me,
My Dear Mrs. Leadbeater,
your very affect. friend,
[underline]Sandford Palmer[/underline]
As I suppose you will wish to
enclose me the terms &c. of Ballitore
School, if you direct to me,
enclosed to my friend James L.
[unclear]Cotter Esqr. M. G. Mallin[/unclear], I shall get
it without Postage. Adieu
My dear James
Please send a card of thy school
ansd. 28th.
