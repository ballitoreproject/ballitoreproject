Elizth. Shackleton
My dear Cousin
apologies for my long silence, after assuring thee, and my dear
Cousins Abram, and Sarah Shackleton, that it has not been owing
to any abatement of affection, or [insertion]want of[/insertion] gratitude for your favours, which
were truly acceptable, thine in particular, my dear Cousin, tho'
short, it was expressive of thy continued regard -
disappointed in not meeting with some of the family in London
tho' I had the satisfaction of hearing of you; we have been favoured
with the company of our esteemed friends Mary Ridgeway and
Jane Watson at my Son's Habitation, they lodged three nights
with us, Mary had been much indisposed with a cold but
was better when they left us - I suppose they are now in the West
Our Son was married lately to an amiable young Woman
Daughter to Richard Bush of Wandsworth in Surrey, they belonged
to our quarterly Meeting; We have not yet left them, they being
very desirous of our continuing with them, which we have agreed
to for a while, their house is large, we have two Appartments
to ourselves, & generally breakfast and drink tea in our own
room, dine and sup with them; my health has been
very indifferent for many months, Sea Air and bathing has
been recommended; on that account my dear Husband brought
me hither to our Brother John Birkbeck's; he was over at our
Marriage, perhaps thou mayst remember him, he married a

I was
young

young Woman from Norwich, Daughter to Henry Gurney; they have
two sweet Children, this in their Summer Residence very near the Sea,
in Winter they are at Lynn, about 17 miles from this place-
The Jaundice, and a long confinement in consequence of a fall, have
materially weakened my constitution, I am much reduced; my nerves
were never strong but thro' continued weakness are now very week, and
my spirits much affected sometimes-but I have abundant cause to be
thankful to kind Providence for numberless unmerited favours, having
a most affectionate Husband and Son, I may now add daughter, for
she and they are disposed to do every thing in their power for my restoration
and comfort, be the former as it may, they I doubt not will have their
reward - I have dwelt longer on the Subject than I intended. -
reward- I have dwelt longer on the Subject than I intended. ---
We saw Thomas Deattergood, George Dyllium his Wife & Samuel Emlyn, in
Town on our way hither, and Elizabeth Drinker, she has long been poorly
her complaint is The Jaundice - Sarah Harrison lately met with the
King at Windsor as he was alighting from his Carriage, she found
her mind engaged to address him, he & his attendants uncovered their
heads whilst she was speaking and were very attentive; he asked her
many questions, where she came from & her motive &c. & behaved very
respectfully, She & my Cousin Sarah Birkbeck are now in Surry I
believe - Samuel Emlyn is about to Embark for America, with
Wm Rotch, his Wife & Daughters, and Martha Routh from Manchester
John Wigham from Scotland - The two latter on a Religious Visit -
We understand John Pemberton is now in Scotland, he did not come over
with Ths. Scattergood as was expected, on account of the decease of a near
relation which happened about the time T. Scattergood sailed.

Margaret Hoyland and Ann Tuke were in London, visiting families
in Westminster quarter, I think, soon after the yearly Meeting they
visited the families in Tottenham, John Wigham Joined them. ---
My Aunt Forster is in her 85th Year, she gets out to
Meeting and enjoys tolerable health Cousin Abram will
remember the Family, I doubt not,
I knew not of my Dear Wife's intention of writing to thee, till
she proposed my finishing her Letter for her; I have looked it over,
& find not much to add, further than my unity in sentiment
with her, & in expressions of sincere affectionate Regard continued for
your Family without exception, & which I desire never to know an abatement
of; in so much that I have at times felt a strong inclination
& proposed it to my Wife, to pay you a Visit, to evince by personal Acknwoledgement
the Sense we retain of your manifold Kindness, would this alone
be sufficient warrant for the Voyage: I may say it is one of the desireable
Things we dare not [underline]promise[/underline] ourselves. What she says of her Husband I
cannot so readily confirm as that of the comfort we have in our valuable
Son & in our hopes of his Choice & late Connexion; I can, however; with
safety (following thine & thy late worthy Husbands example, whose
memory is dear to us) join with her in subscribing ourselves, with dear
Love to you all,
Thy truly affectionate Friends & Relatives
P.S. Please to remember us very
affectionately to Cousins Abram, Lydia, &
theirs - to dear Cousins Mary, & Sarah
& to Cousin T. & D. Chandlee, Cousins S. & M. Gubb
