London: 5/6 month 1790

Elizabeth Pike
Dear friend,
	It occurred to me, as I lay in bed this morning, to write to thee, believing some account of ^thy^ friends here would not be unacceptable. I engaged William Taylor, on his departure, to forward a Yearly-meeting printed Epistle to thy husband, remembering that he looked liked to have it early. There is also a written general epistle, touching matters more particularly relative to deficiencies in our own religious society, which it is likely will be sent over soon. The meeting was large, of both men & women: & I hope the several sittings of it may be said to have been favoured with a degree of Good. There is to be sure a light spirit too prevalent, a spirit that is easily set a going, swift to speak, which (it is to be feared) is not attentively enough learning of the husband at home - this is often too much afloat - yet a weighty ponderous spirit is still preserved, which helps much to check & keep down that which is high - & salutary regulations & reformations are getting forward, though slowly, through patient perseverance & meekness of wisdom - the servants of the Lord (like their great Master) not striving, nor crying in their own time & strength, but waiting for the time of life, & for the ability which proceedeth from the head of the church - Hereby, by such haltings & movements, [page number] 33 by such encampments & journeying forward, our ancients made a noble stand against the false ways, & corrupt customs which were in the world, both civil & religious, & were enabled to carry on a successful war under the banners of the Prince of Peace - But alas! depravity & weakness succeeded, lukewarmness & indifference crept in, & it must be acknowledged that we are become a lapsed people, though it is not, nor ever will, be a lost cause - for the baptizing power of Truth is still amongst us - we are still mercifully favoured with lively oracles - we have still fathers & mothers, evangelists & teachers in the church - there are still devoted, dedicated, well-qualified instruments, who are willing to run to & fro, & to jeopard [?] their lives for the promotion of Christs reign upon earth - & (thanks to Infinite Goodness therefore!) there is a hopeful prospect among our youth of a succession of testimony-bearers for him, & faithful labourers in his work. This I am persuaded, dear friend, at times cheers thy drooping spirit in thy lonely hours of meditation & retirement, in which I doubt not but thou findest consolation & encouragement - being gladdened ^now^ in thy sequestration & recess, that in the prime of life & outward prosperity, thou gavest up to the heavenly vision, renounced the follies & vanities of a delusive & deceitful world, which lies in wickedness & ignorance, & embraced the gospel of Christ, with all the tribulations & persecutions belonging thereto. Happy is it now, & happy for ever will it be for thee, that thou took up the cross, despised the shame & joined the little flock, the companions of Christ in his sufferings, for surely (as thou art graciously & mercifully preserved ^& sustained^ to the end) thou will also reign with Him for ever!
[page number] 34 I am here detained waiting for the motion of my beloved friend - - who I hope will be ready to depart the beginning of the ensuing week. I am only uneasy lest my dear wife should be uneasy at my stay - which indeed is not voluntary, nor (I humbly hope) contrary to the divine (will, perhaps I might venture to say) ordering. I have not been very idle here, nor am I disposed to be idle, no more than impertinently busy in affairs of religious society - I am greatly favoured in seeing clearly my own comparative weakness & insufficiency - & I rejoice in the sense, the humiliating, self-abasing sense of it - in which I earnestly desire ever to be preserved. ++++
	Ye perhaps have ^heard^ that a commodious place for holding the Yearly Mens & Womens meetings, near Devonshire-house, was agreed for by Friends & ten thousand pounds directed to be raised for the purpose ^purchase ^erecting edifices for the purpose^ - accurate estimates - plans &c, all to be brought up & laid before next Yearly meeting - This was carried through the meeting, & concluded with ^such^ unanimity, nobility of spirit & liberality that I was much affected during its [sic] transaction, though of an external nature, under a belief that a blessing was in it. May generations to come meet there under the covering of holy solemnity, & a host of living worshippers long assemble in that place, offering unitedly sweet incense to the everlasting Father! ++++
	Dear friend, farewell
		Richard Shackleton
