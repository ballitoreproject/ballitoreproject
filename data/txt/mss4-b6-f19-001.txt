Daniel Place Phippsboro' 1st Aug 1825.
Dear friend
I received your kind letter and have
attended to the directions contained therein. I have
had a few lines from G.Downes dated Paris 24th June
He and his family were well and "delightfully situated
in the [underline]Rue Cassette[/underline] No 30 near the gardens of the
Luxembourg comfortably boarded & lodged very cheaply"
He says this dwelling is near the south west corner of the
city and sent me a diagram which I copy for your
inspection [underline]north[/underline] Paris
Louvre Bridge
Island

River Seine
Rue de Vaugirard
[underline]South[/underline]

I am grateful for your kind mention of me
and my family, but am sorry to add that we have
met a severe trial in the death of our little
Rue
Cassette
Rue de la
Seine

James Michael whom we have this morning interred
his mother had a severe fever last April which lasted
25 days and which confined her until the end of June
Poor little James Michl was obliged to be weaned at Six months
old in consequence of his mother's illness, and the day after
she got the favourable crisis he was seized with convulsions
and was with [insertion]the[/insertion] utmost difficulty recovered and was very
delicate over time until about three weeks ago when
he shewed visible signs of improvement - but after a
week or ten days of good health he was attacked by
a lax which the doctor told us not to be afraid of
as it proceeded from his teething which unfortunately
put us off our guard, and when the doctor saw the
child at the prescribed time, he found I believe that
he had suffered it to go on too long - he then prescribed
a very active medicine which I fear drove the disorder
up to his head, and he died of inward convulsions -
I endeavour to reconcile poor Catherine to her loss
by pointing out to her the much more severe visitation
our poor friends met in the deaths of their [underline]two[/underline] little
ones - and the consideration that he and they are
in the sure possession of an [underline]Eternity of bliss in[/underline] the
presence of their Eternal Father, whose "thoughts are
"not our thoughts, nor his ways our ways."

Please give my sincere love to our [underline]dear Richard[/underline]
and to all friends.
I had the pleasure of seeing Richard Webb
on Saturday evening and of hearing further of our
friends and of which intelligence you are aware
I am Dear friend
with affectionate respect -
your much obliged
Jas Jno Langan
My wife and I are going with our little [unclear]Catherine[/unclear]
to take a walk to dissipate the sadness of our thoughts
as every object in the house reminds us of our loss.
