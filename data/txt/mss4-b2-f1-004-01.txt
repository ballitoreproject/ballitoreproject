My dear James,                

Thine of 21st written in the shallows, & the Postscript penned in deeper water were both acceptable to me. I find, as thou mentions [sic], Retirement a most profitable practice, & generally owned by greater or lesser degrees of Good: But even in this Good is great variety - there is good water & good wine - there is Good in drinking of the Water of life - there is good in being washed in it - it is good to feed on heavenly bread - & yet the spiritual man does not live by bread alone, but also by every word, by every dispensation which according to the variety of our states, in infinite wisdom, proceedeth out of the mouth of God, is decreed and appointed for us. Thou art a very favoured man. Use all diligence to "hold ^that^ fast which thou hast, for believe me this crown of rejoicing, this diadem of beauty may through unwatchfulness, be soon taken away. The eye which has been opened to see aright may be closed, the candle of the Lord may be put out, and our insidious adversary may as in a moment get in, & defile the temple of the heart.
