I am sure it is in great heast I am going to write to thee
my dear Friend but let that be as it will I do not think
much of it if i thought it woud amuse my dear Friend one
moment I am my dear Molly in a very serious mood to night
I know not the reason my mind is very much disturb'd at my own
thoughts dost thou never experience it I have thought a good deal of
my dear Father who is gone to his long home & of a Tender Mother
who is far from me but the greatist comefort I have is to think
she is doing the Lords work & in hopes of seeing her soon we
got home safe before thy Father or Mother I must bid thee adieu
for the present I remain as I hope thee thinks me to be thy
