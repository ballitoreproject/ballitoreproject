I received my dear Cousin's acceptable favour of the
28[insertion]th[/insertion] of last month, & for once have a mind to answer with
out making as long a delay as usual, that thou may see
I am determined not to let the correspondence drop on my
side, tho' I don't forget that I am longer in cousin Sally's
debt, I intend the next opportunity to make her
some return, though it should not be near the value, for
I must confess myself but a poor scribe, tho' you are so good
natured as to indulge me with your correspondence.
We were very glad to hear of my Grandmother's
recovery, it's like thy Brother is a piece of a Physician, as
well as a Master; how does he like the progress my Brother
has made since he became his pupil, poor little fellow
he was sometimes rather idle at his latin when here, which
I think was no wonder, as he had no competitor to excite
him

him to emulation. It is very agreeable to hear
that thy sister Grubb is so happy in her new relations,
as she is so far separated from her own, I suppose she
may soon expect to be a Mother, we heard thy sister Debby
was going to stay with her till it be over: I don't
doubt but thou spent thy time very agreeably in Munster,
tho' thou could scarcely meet with a pleasanter
place than Ballitore; My Mother keeps me between
hope & despair about going there this summer, for a
while. I thought all was fixed, now she says she questions
that she can get to the half year meeting this
year, & thinks I can't well go without her, but it will
not be for want of inclination if I don't get. Molly
Pemberton was so kind as to press me to spend some time
with her, believe if I go to Leinster, My Mother will
let

let me stay a bit with her, either going or coming back, but
if I can get leave to follow my own inclination, I shan't
make much delay till I get to your beautiful village.
The account thou saw in the newspaper was true,
this poor unfortunate young man who lived near Armagh,
giving way to some despondency, put an end to
his life by hanging himself, & as the common people in
this country, have a barbarous custom of not suffering
the corps of such deluded Creatures, to lie under ground,
the neighbours where he lived, to be rid of so disagreeable
sight as a corpse dragged about from place, to place,
till it was shocking to look at being ten days dead, hired
a carman to remove it [deletion]from[/deletion] to some distant part
& bury it, which he performed very badly, carelesly brought
the body in a sack at night, threw it into a river beside
the canal opposite to our garden, in t he morning
it was taken up & supposed to be murdered, Sir Richard

Richard Johnson exerted himself, [deletion]found[/deletion] pursued ^[insertion]the[/insertion] Carman
about twelve miles & found out how the matter was, then
came back & had the poor creatures remains buried in
his own land, where nobody durst meddle with him.
We hear pretty frequently from John Gough, & Thomas
Greer, the last account we had from them was that
they were well.
I conclude with dear love to thy Aunt, my
Grandmother, cousin Sam Carleton, & thy sisters in which
I am joined by my mother, also please to accept a
I am, thy very affectionate
large thyself
