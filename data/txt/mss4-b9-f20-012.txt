My dear E- I hope thou art getting
better & that every thing will be
soon settled to thy mind, - H
Lefanu is in the country or was
a short time ago I believe with
Lissy I intend to pop off to town
some day soon & make enquiry
about her & execute thy commission
if I can find her
D Johnson will do the needful
about the candlesticks &c &c
& will also tell [insertion]thee[/insertion] the price of
old silver I am unwilling to
b[insertion]u[/insertion]y what thou hast, as I think
it would only be for [underline]show[/underline]
& I may lay out money to more
advantage - Thou wilt be glad
to hear that Margt. is getting better
tho very slowly she is not able
to walk much yet I was very
anxious to accept of thy kind invitation
for her, but there seem'd

no open for it & perhaps it is
all for the best & I will have
it in store if Dublin will not
agree with her, - the cough is
declining with all & I hope when
it is gone they will recover
their strength Willy is livelier
& stronger than he was I hope
he will soon be on his feet
again, it will be most delightful
well again, how does young
Abraham get on? my boy
laughs & would crow only
he is still hoarse, What was
Sally Davis & hers doing in
Ballitore was it a visit of
love? How are M Doyle & Abby? my dear love to them
I owe Abby for the felt ask her
to have them all
should I renew it & what quantity
should I put on, if necessary
to renew it, I wish I could see
you all, alas what a loss it is
to Lydia & me to live so far
from those we love so dearly
poor Lydia how much she
was to be felt for! - when
thou hast time I will expect
a long letter from thee
3d or 4th of 10th mo 1827
ever thy SB
