guide Joseph Clarke. After dinner, 15 miles, to Sheffield,
& took up our quarters at John & Elizth. Hoyland's.
12th. To meeting. To tea in the afternoon at Thos.
Colly's, his wife indisposed. I suppose this was a
comfortable day to S:T, who was much engaged in
a variety of houses, she went a piece into the country
with John Hoyland to see a friend who was
confined. To me this was a day of dismay & bearing
down, & I thought when I laid me down in bed,
feeling distress, (& I knew not why) that I should
long remember Sheffield. 13th. S:T behind Thos. Scanterberry,
Elizth., Hoyland behind her husband, & Barnard
again taking me, went to meeting, 6 miles, to Woodhouse,
wherein [underline]my[/underline] faith was tried: returned to Sheffield
after dinner. 14th. at an early hour set out for
Stockport, where we arrived before dark, 36 miles.
Elizth. Hoyland came with us a piece in a post-
chaise, which helped us on 15 miles of hilly road,
as far as Castletown, where we saw a wonderful
natural curiosity, a great *Cave, or such like, [unclear]in[/unclear]
a rock, folk going on with business, & having
houses in it, as tho' it was a dark little town.
