47 Basinghall st. London 2. 8. 1825. -
Dear Sarah,
As Joshua Abell has promised to breakfast
with me tomorrow morning & has offered to take any
letters for my Irish friends, I presume he will not object to
perform that office for one who has so old & well-founded a
title to that appellation as thyself not withstanding the satirical
rubs with which in thy thoughtless girlish days, thou used
at times to afflict him.
I [unclear]much[/unclear] in safety how about 48 hours after I [unclear]paited[/unclear]
I arrived in safety here about 48 hours after I parted
with thee, & that very evening accidentally espied James White
& Dr. John Walker on a Paddington coach going off to visit
Jean - Battiste Say, the French Political Economist; I immediately
mounted the coach, in order to concert arrangements with James
White for the following day, but was compelled to dismount by the
inexorable coachman who silenced even the urgent solicitation
[unclear]exochable[/unclear] coachman who silenced even the [unclear]ingent[/unclear] solicitation
of John Walker in my favour by the unanswerable declaration that
it was contrary to act of Parliament to permit one additional
outside passenger. I was compelled therefore to submit to the authority
Parliament, however mortifying. -
been most happy to avail himself of the [underline]privilege[/underline] of my instructions. This, thou
mayest judge, was a considerable relief to my to my mind -
On my arrival here from Ireland, I found a note on my table from George
Downes, requesting me to enquire of the Principal German booksellers here what works of
Moses Mendelsohn have been translated into English & send account for him
to thy Edward: now, I have made enquiry, - & the said German booksellers [deletion]inform[/deletion]
say that they are not able to inform me.-
I hope I have not tired thee with this long, egotistical, gossiping letter.
& that the dread of such another will not deter thee from writing to me, as it is
that this dread of much another will not deter thee from writing to me, as it is
not often that I feel in such a humour for that kind of composition as I have
this [unclear]coming[/unclear]. With love to thy Edward & all our Balliton friends
this evening.- With love to thy Edward & all our Ballitore friends
I remain affectionately

The following morning however James White & I met free from interruption
by coachmen or act of Parliament, & proceeded to Tottenham,
him, when we spent the day in a very gratifying manner at John
where we spent the day in a very gratifying manner at John
Hodgkin's. - We took tea at Thomas Richardson's, Stamford Hill, &
walked home in the cool of the evening.- This was first day. Next morning,
[deletion]I saw[/deletion] James White went off to Dover on his way to the Continent, &
left me to my ordinary avocations. - I accordingly [deletion]went[/deletion] [insertion]walked[/insertion] out to Stoke-
Newington, intending to breakfast with Wm Allen, & talk over intended
arrangements, but, alas! - I found them all fled to Lindfield in Sussex --
However Thomas, the black servant, kindly gave me my breakfast,
& I went in search of new adventures. - I first went to Spring Rice's;
but here, the servant, after going up to announce my arrival, brought down
word that [underline]Master[/underline] Rice was out of town, but that [underline]Mr[/underline] Rice would write
to me as soon as he was ready to resume his lessons; - so off I went
to Sir Charles Coote's & spent my hour there with my pupil Algernon.
I began to-day with another of my pupils, & Rice is now the only
absent one. - An alteration has taken place in the Stoke Newington
arrangements, which, though not affecting my pecuniary interests, is
one that is not very accordant with my inclinations. - My [underline]whole[/underline]
time there is now monopolized at Susanna Corder's instead of being,
as before, divided between that & William Allen's . - I have thus had

to exchange the interesting & most agreeable society of William Allen, the
friendly familiarity & unreserved sociability which subsisted between
[deletion]the[/deletion] my class there & myself, spending the night & following morning at
his house, & often returning in the carriage with him next morning - I have
I say, to exchange this for the stiff, silent, reserved tea-table at
Susanna Corder's lined on both sides with awe-struck female
figures, myself oppressed with the awkward feeling of being the only
man in the room, or indeed, in the house; - after tea the dull monotory
of class after class for three hours is to be endured, unrelieved
by a single lively remark, save when the French vivacity of
at tine Majolier, served occasionally to break the spell; but
still it is evident that even she cannot feel at home in such an
atmosphere & her attempts to infuse a spirit of cheerfulness are
enfeebled by the torpid frigidity which prevails. - I have not
once had an opportunity of speaking to Wm Allen since I came except
a shake of the hand I had from him as he went into meeting
last first day; - & I have quite lost my Russian friend Djunkouski
& Robert Sessions, - who were some of my most agreeable & interesting
companions..
I must not, however repine, for I have much to enjoy & be thankful

for.. My old friend Doctor Hodgkin I see almost daily.. I took tea with
him last evening in company with a young friend from Philadelphia, who is acquainted
with Jacob Harvey. - He is on his way to the continent with Edwin
Richman, &, after his return, intends, next summer, to visit Ireland.. He amused
us highly with his account of a Shaker meeting of which he was an eye-witness.
I think I mentioned to thee in Ballitore the awkward situation in which I felt
in regard to Joseph Fry. - Well, last first day week, I sat opposite to him again at
Pluiston meeting.. When meeting broke up, he shook hands with me, very politely apologized
for not answering my note, which he would have done had he not expected to
do so verbally in a short time, - said that his view of engaging me for his son had been
entirely limited to the Darlington vacation & had been relinquished from a desire to make
his holidays perfect holidays while he had them, & but for this consideration he would have
