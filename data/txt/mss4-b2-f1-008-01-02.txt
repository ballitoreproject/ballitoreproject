From the same to the same

				Ballitore 12th month 1781
My dear friend
	+++ I like that young men should avow their principles, & range themselves on the right side. I like that they should engage in such acts as will show they are not in alliance with the enemies of God's true Israel. There must & will be enmity between the two seeds.
My spirit has waded in the deeps many a time in travail for the visited youth, that not one grain of the heavenly seed might be lost, nor unfruitful, & now my cry is that they may "Go forward". They have, many of them, been tied up from the further sallies of their own wild natures; they have known the discipline of the cross, & now the Master hath need of them, he calls for their service in the church. Indeed they can never serve a better master - his service dignifies the meanest talents; & the brightest, if they tend not to promote it, are but meanly employed. This world, its bustle, its pursuits, & its highest glory, will soon be over [page number 224] to every one that is at present in it. Then the answer of, "Well done! good & faithful servant", will be a more joyful sound, a more substantial reward, than all the favour & friendship, false praise & honour which this life can bestow. ++++
