My dear Elizabeth,
I thought you would like to have a line
by John Fitzsimmons to inform about thy
uncle who I hope is not worse than when you
went, though he did not rest well last night.
Perspirations yesterday & to-day I hope will do him
good. No letter from any side for any of us since
you went [insertion]except one to Sarah from J Fisher not opened yet[/insertion] I hope you got timely & well to Carlow.
If thou hast not got the pickling pot do not mind
it, if thou hast n'importe. Thy father desires
thou wilt buy a metal kettle about half as
large again as the one we had, with a good
pouring spout. Perhaps a Milk pan for
Hardy's people may be got instead of the

pickling pot. Anne Doyle tolerable. Mary goes
to morrow for Dublin. Thy father says if
thou cannot well bring the Milk pan thou may
omit it, also to call on Eben for money if thou
hast not of thy own. I cannot particularize
love but give it as thou knows how, for we
are just going to tea & then John departs.
Biddy seems to answer so far very well. Margt.
lodging at Mrs. [unclear]Weft's[/unclear]. Sarah is all this day
at Eben's performing what I desired, & is to
preserve some of her gooseberries for
Thy affte. mother
M. Leadbeater.
23d.
My love to Barcroft Wilson
H. Boake begs thou will bring her particular
word about her child.
