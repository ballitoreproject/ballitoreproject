girls left us on 3d day the boys the day before

astonishes herself Rich'd went with her &
staid till yesterday morning, Edw & I went
in the evening & came home this
Morning my aunt Gough stays [deletion][/deletion] the
time so that they are not left without
some company, Elica has a good Deal to
look after which keeps her from brooding
over her sorrow Lucy is very dull but
the other children seem much as usual
I hope thou wilt come to the meeting
& ask M S if she would take half thy
bed, tell my father his bed shall be ready
for him, I went to day to get the stuff

gone so did not get any as there was
none so cheap left I shall send by the
first op: a doz of pocket handkerchiefs
& any of them that you do not like send
back & I will get others instead the cost

from this, & thy pockethandkerchiefs - indeed I do
not remember how I sent them but write
& say if all is right & renew thy former commissions
as I have lost the recollection of them
I had a sweet letter from my mother - she says
Lydia recovers slowly, is it true that she
was 3 days in labour? I hope not but do
