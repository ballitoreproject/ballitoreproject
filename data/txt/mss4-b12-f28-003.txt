Paaris Hôtel Wagram
June 23th 1850
My dearest Mamma
Though I write
now I cannot say much as we have
very little time. I just write to say
what we are going to do. Uncle
Thomas got the long expected letter
from Dr Henry yesterday he wants
us to meet him at Cologne, and
Uncle Thomas is writing now to him
to say that he expects to be there
about the 28th, Uncle Thomas cannot
say yet till he sees Dr Henry whether
he will go home by Holland or
go direct by Ostend, he intends to
try if he can get Dr Henry to go
home with him, that is what we
intend to do now, and I write to let
you know, I shall be glad to leave

Paris, it is so very hot here, it is well
if we are not all melted away but
the time we get home we have lovely
weather, [underline]very[/underline] hot very fine no clouds
and very dry - not only that but
we have Uncle [insertion]Arthur[/insertion] Willie, and Mr [unclear]Synes[/unclear]
Jos Carol and Thomas White were also
here but I believe they are going on
to Venice. We spent Sunday at
St cloud I like it better than
Versailles, to this latter I believe
we are going again to today to see
the inside of the Palace that is one
reason we are in such a hurry now
as it starts at 4 oClock and wont
be open again till Saturday and I
hope we will be at Cologne then
away from this hot place -. Uncle
Arthur thinks of returning to
England to night, he cannot bear
 the heat and says he wont stay
any longer in Paris we wanted him
to come to Cologne with us, - he wont,
he says he wd not have come here at
all [deletion]except[/deletion] [insertion]only[/insertion] we were here I got thy
letter by him he brought it one from
Kensington, do not be uneasy about
[underline]me[/underline] I am very well off. I brought some
Towels with me, we were on the top of
the Panthéon yesterday, we could
see all over Paris from it, if you
would write as soon as you get
this to Cologne I would get it before
I left that, mind that the weight is
[underline]well under[/underline] a quarter of an ounce
we dont know the postage. Uncle T.
says if you post it without paying for
it he will pay for it when he gets it
if we should leave that without
getting it then the money wont be
wasted on it, the direction is
[underline]Thomas Elder Henry[/underline]
Poste restante
Cologne

mind to put Uncle Ts. name [underline]full[/underline]
I forgot to say anything about St
Cloud. Sunday was the fête day
there with the fountains and
one wd think all Paris was
there there were such crowds there
there is a tower in the centre
of the garden's or Park on the top
of which we went the view from
that is another beautiful view
in fact all the views here, [insertion]I[/insertion] think
are worth looking at.
I have no news only I am in
haste I am glad to hear S [unclear]Howell[/unclear]
intends coming to us -
Give my love to all ever thy
affectionate Daughter.
