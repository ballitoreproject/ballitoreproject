My Dear Mrs. Leadbeater/
I received a Letter from Rev. [unclear]W. English[/unclear]
Rector of Moate telling me that in consequence of
a letter from the Bishop of Meath he had been
enabled to appoint me to his vacant Cure of [unclear]Theras[/unclear]
It was my intention to go down to Ballitore
for a few days previous to my going to Moat & I believe
I shall next week - but least I might not
have it in my power personally to thank you
for your kind Letter of introduction to the Bishop
(through the means of which [underline]alone[/underline] I believe
I was appointed) I beg of you to accept
by Letter my unfeigned & sincere thanks for
your Letter & that I shall not cease to remember
your kindness & good nature - with every
wish for the Health & welfare of yourself & family
I am my Dr. Madam
yrs very sincerely [unclear]MBarton[/unclear]
