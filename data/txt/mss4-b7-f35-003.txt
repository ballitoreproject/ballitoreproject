about my coat yesterday I had thy kind letter with
the pattern which I do not like not because I think

Thou could scarcely have chose anything more
ugly perhaps there might be one got at someother
shop the colour of Thine if not I would rather be
a while longer without it, let my belove Sally since
we parted she has been the frequent companion of
my mind with a nearness I cannot express, my
very dear love to Her Our friends hear are well as
far as I know accept Cousin D. Watson who still complains,
but was out yesterday, I suppose her complaints
are Common to women in Her way, so my
dear Molly take care of Thy Self least thou should
get into this complaining way, [deletion]any[/deletion] a line from
Thee would be truly acceptable as I wish to know
how they Dear Children over the water are also
how their tender parents have born up under the

load of cair and anxiety They laboured under when I last
saw Them remember me affectionately to Them also to
my Dear friends Thy Honourable Father and Mother
and accept a large shair to Thy whole self from one
who truly loves Thee Sarah Watson
