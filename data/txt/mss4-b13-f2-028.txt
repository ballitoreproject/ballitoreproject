3d.. meeting-day at Carlisle, to which we went & in which S:T laboured
for the great-cause sake.- mary Richardson also spoke, it
affected my heart, & I was hard set to keep my eyes bounded,
upon seeing this friend, whom the last time I saw was at my dearly
beloved father's funeral,- such things [underline]must[/underline] be, - Oh for resignation!
Went after dinner to Wigton, 11 miles, guided by David Carrick,
we got here before Sarah Harrison & S:B, whose horse had fallen &
their chair was broke coming along, but they escaped hurt, & were
soon after us here, in a hack-chaise:- went to SH's appointed publick
meeting at 6 O'clock, which was very large, & I believe
satisfactory: we lodged at mary Dickinson's a widow. 4th.. Went
to moorhouse, 8 miles, to meeting, after which went to dinner to
Carlisle, David Carrick's, 3 miles, left his house after 4 O'clock, &
went 3 miles to an appointed publick meeting, of S:H's, in Scotby.
