2nd Sunday a showery one but
on the whole rather fine.
Breakfast was late or we sat longer
after it, came up and read and
then went out for an hour -
In our rooms until about 1 1/2
when we set off again down the
Blarney road and up another pretty
woody one where we were overtaken
by the two Miss Staceies whom
we accompanied the rest of the way
or rather we mutually accompanied
each other. Dinner was not
until half past three so we were
not hurried home.
After it we took another stroll
and had Mr. Hamilton's company -
he seems a good sort of man but
he seemed a good sort of man but
no-way striking is a Scotchman
by birth, but lives in Limerick
where he carries on a bookseller's
trade, has a wife and family.
On our return we [insertion]Ned and I[/insertion] sat by Ned's
fire reading &c until tea time.
