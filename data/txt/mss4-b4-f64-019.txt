The shortest day 1818
My dear aunt
Thy last little letter was very
acceptable & merits a better return than I have
either time or capacity to make. As to A.W.
I would not venture to mention her to S.G. as I know
she would not like I should, & my aunt thinks any
application to Becky Wade would be disagreeable &
unsuccessful. John Wilson has returned to reside
in Clonmel; his daughters are both at N. Chayton's
& are well. My aunt is chatting to Sally Averall
so I take [deletion]the[/deletion] advantage [insertion]of it[/insertion] to write - Please tell Betsy
that E. Finlay bore a son yesterday at one o'clock.
My aunt & I dined at Richard's yesterday, came
home to tea; Jenny Taylor's family there also.
Sam is in Waterford, with his sweet, amiable
D. to whom he is warmly attached: he is about
to get [underline]a[/underline] pearl of great price mind I say [underline]a[/underline] not
[underline]the[/underline], tho' I hope he may find both. I am
glad to hear the good news of Sally H. H. & hope
to hear more of her after the meeting; it must
be encouraging to our precious M.W. about
whom I constantly think - please present my
dear love to her, James, Sally & Betsy B. who
I suppose will hardly attend the meeting. My
love also to Hannah & Anna, F.B. Emma Little,
and Abby & Becky. H. Boakes love was very acceptable.
mine to her - doubtless she is now with her boy, who

I hope is quite well. I am glad my dear aunt that
the hearing of my letters affords thee so much satisfaction
they are poor offerings. My mother says my aunt C is
bad with her breathing, tell her with my dear love that
their smoking the [underline]Stramonium[/underline] or Thorn-apple, two or
three times a day, is of great use in the asthma, she can
ask her kind Physician about it. I hope dear H.D. is better
my love to her & Mary. Where does Mary C. lodge?
[underline]Cousin Jakey[/underline] ought to be advised by some of his
cleanly relatives to pay more attention to decency. I
am uneasy about my dear aunt Lydia's rheumatism
& wish I could hear of [insertion]her[/insertion] being able to go to Carlow,
my dear love awaits her & my cousins, male
& female & our valuable M & A.D. Farewell my
dear aunt says thy very affte niece E Leadbeater
thy kind wishes for my well-being will not I hope be
wholly fruitless.
To
Sarah Shackleton
Sally Averall desire her love
to thee, Betsy & Mary - My
aunts dear love to all. She
is tolerably well.
