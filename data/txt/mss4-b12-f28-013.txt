in Domo d'Ossolo & sleep in
Isella on the top of the Simplon
& then Friday [insertion]we[/insertion] go on to Brieg
if it is not very dear I think
Uncle will go over the Grimsel
to Unterseen & back over
the Seine to Geneva - from
that up to Bale where I hope
to get a letter - we are
not in Switzerland now
our luggage was searched
this morning in a very funny
manner - only one of our
portmanteaus was opened
when they found we were
from England. They did not
open more - they were amused

to see so many of the one
family - took Aunt Eliza to
be the Grd-mother - Uncle S
says they took me to be Kate
Robert's mother, I don't believe
that - at all events it was
a funny scene.
Our drive here was very
beautiful - part of the way
by Lake Maggiore the rest
between [underline]high[/underline] hills - planted
from top to bottom with trees
I will write as soon as
I can again in haste
now ever thy affectionate
Daughter
Emily
