Ballitore: 30/6 mo: 1805.
My dear Betsy,
I have made two offers at this already, & shall not waste time in
telling thee how liable I am to interruption. On our way from meeting we saw
some [deletion]some[/deletion] [insertion]smoke[/insertion] arising from Paddy Murphy's backside, as no one seemed to mind it
we thought it might be some indifferent matter, but presently the huge columns
of smoke rolling along called the the neighbours exertions, & presently [deletion]thou[/deletion] the gate
was opened, & men were on the house stripping Carney's, & quenching Paddy's. It was
his cow to use & stable, & turf & boards, but how it happened we have not yet heard
flames raged violently, but did not last long [insertion]nor spread[/insertion] Richard Leadbeater heard Paddy [unclear]Mur[/unclear]phy
when undeceived was, in distress on the Orchards account which he thought was burning a[unclear][/unclear]
[unclear][/unclear]nt, which he took in a literal sense, & wept & lamented piteously. Sarah was
all in tears, but as soon as the fire ceased, went to see the Mr. & brought one cow they
She was ready to faint, & had fainted. Eliz: was [unclear][/unclear] at a window upstairs, & Mary
Shackleton, her eyes suffused in tears, carried water. Since this adventure our lazy
Bees have swarmed & I hope this evening to place another family in my new colony. We
have one, & many were present at the house warming. Ebenezer Just on the grapes - John &
Agnes have approved, & the Bees themselves seem perfectly satisfied, though as yet we see
no work going on in the [unclear]glaper[/unclear]. I sat watching them day after day, & strongly advised
them to consider and proposals, & promised them more happiness than any Bees in
this neighbour[insertion]hood[/insertion]. Not perceiving that they paid the least attention to my wholesome
admonitions, I addresst them in the following lines.
Hither turn, ye busy wanderers,
Nor to seek a dwelling roam.
Hear your friend, who kindly offers
Safety, comfort, & a home.
Here, unscorch'd by sultry summer
Your sweet looks in peace pursue,
And the rage of surly Winter
Here can never injure you.
Never to this happy mansion
Shall the murderous match draw nigh.
Cherish here your tender offspring,
And the wants of age supply.
[deletion]Here unscorch'd by sultry Summer,[/deletion]
Wither turn, ye busy wanderers
Nor to seek a dwelling roam,
Hear your friend, who kindly offers
Safety, comfort & a home.
By the falling from a pipe tis supposed.

Night is come & our Bees still remain in the bush with the hive over them, they were
shook, but refused staying, & retreated to the bush again, & we think it was wrong to use forcible
means, I am in the painful state of suspence, from which I hope to-morrow may relieve
me. This delightful evening was spent in a delightful manner. [unclear]Ju[/unclear] Jane Thos., M Park
Lydia Shackleton Junr. & Eliz: Leadbeater spent it at Irishtown. Mary & Anne at Boakefield
Wm & I & the rest of the children at John Farmer's, where we were not only regaled, but
stuffed with cherries. We drank tea in the new bower in the garden, where on what had been
the body of gig, but now looked somewhat like a theme, "exalted sate" Mr.. Maconky & myself,
much at our ease as to the outward, passing compliments, & handing cherries to each other;
beside us, at our footstool, as it were, sate our husband & wife, & next to them the remainder

of the company. Yesterday evening was still more delightful, we spent it at the
Mill with John & Agnes, the charming Agnes, who ranks full as high in my [unclear]estimation[/unclear]
as Ju[unclear][/unclear] Melesina. After tea we retired to the garden where great magick, by moder[unclear][/unclear]
called [underline]cruds[/underline], went forward, thy mother & I first [unclear]payed[/unclear] our hand, & we soon behold [unclear][/unclear]
Wm. engaged in like manner. When we had fully settled our affair, we parted, & thy
Mother & Wm.. joined stocks for a considerable time. Agnes had perceived the ruddy tinge
of the setting Sun, & took it as a warning to go homeward, but we suddenly engaged in
another [underline]crud[/underline] (Agnes & I) & walked many times up & down the middle walk, followed by
John & Lydia Jun., who had a pretty confab also, but I believe of little moment - Not so ours -
but I am not to tell - however I may hint that she has succoured the distressed, & that her
humanity equals her other shining qualities. Agnes misses thee, & spoke of thee as I
would wish
1/7 mo: A day once much renowned in Ballitore, when Roses & Orange lilies adorned the
same, & Wm. Keatinge & Betty Jackson danced. I am sorry to say our Bees remain in the bush
obstinately attached to their own way. Eliz: & Deborah were greatly pleased & obliged by thy
letters, & so was I, they were so appropriate, just the thing. I feel lonely without thee, even
to see thee enter with thy work bag, tho' [deletion]not[/deletion] destined for [unclear]S: Mrs, WN's &c[/unclear], was a comfort, but to
have thee all to myself was more, & yet I do not wish thee to resign the pleasures thou now
[deletion]enjoys[/deletion] [unclear]lasts[/unclear]. I am charmed with what I hear of Mr. Saville, I am glad dear Jane now enjoys the
"rural quiet" which alone seemed necessary to complete her terrestrial happiness - no - there is
another source of happiness, which I hope she will ere long [deletion]enjoy[/deletion] possess. Besure remember me
'Excuse bad spelling
I never heard a hint of what thou & I spoke of in J. Middlecolls garden.

my friend Ben a Benjamin's portion, & ask him why I do not hear from him? Wm's stray
shirt & waistcoat arrived yesterday; a neck handkerchief not marked, a night cap & pair of
stockings still remain behind. If thou could, without causing any fuss, make an enquiry about
these perhaps thro' Samuels means, I would be obliged, but I would be sorry any uneasiness was
caused by the enquiry. I suppose Jane is in the North. If thou see Mary Dickinson please
give my love [unclear][/unclear] do ask whether Ben has Thos. Tuper. Inquire, when convenient, if
Cypress trees are to be had & what the expense of two would be at the largest size fit for
removal. Tell me if thou saw R Colles & what said of my books, & whether Mappheas is
on his way to publish view. [insertion]+,[/insertion] Mary & Ann's love to thee, they have a message but the

& I am going to finish this letter, which I much fear will not please thee. In Paddy's case I appear
very unfeeling, & in all the rest very frivolous, but take me for better or for worse. Mr. Doyle
requests that if Ben Naughten has any thin muslin between 2.0 & 2.4 per yard (not over,
or under, as they have finer, & think coarser than 2.0 would not suit them) that thou
will get 6 yards, & if he had a smaller quantity they would prefer it at present; also 2 boxes
Salt lemon. Please let us know the amount, & they will send the money; for now I think of it
I believe I will enclose an order for some money which Melesina's agent promised to pay
any friend of mine on their giving a receipt. This I request thou will get, but do not
offer it for a day or two, as if he has not received the piece of flannel which I got made
for [insertion]her[/insertion], perhaps he will not pay. And please buy for me as much buff coloured muslin as
will make the gloves for myself & two daughters such as Fanny Bawley has gloves of. Last
evening Debby Chandlee came, she lodges here at present with Mary Doyle [insertion](Thos)[/insertion], reserves her
visit to the Mill till thy return. They had a very pleasant ride in one of your carts,
which they prefer to a car. We remain in the dark as to Brother H's affairs, & I fear has
Sister's spirits are much deprest. How is poor George? I fear he walks too much, my dear
love to him. Wm. just comes in sends his dear love, he longs to see thee, but thinks it a
pity to curtail thy pleasures. Did thou send my letter & [unclear][/unclear] to P. Dell? & how didst
like the former? for I suppose thou receiv'd the packet I sent thee by Wm. Allen's Nurse?

Alas, where is sentiment gone to, which was won't so prettily to fill a letter

Sits perch'd upon my pen?
A perpetual motion of tongues, & [deletion]of[/deletion] accidental motion of feet intrudes upon me, & put
my ideas to flight, & thy sky is overcast with such a gloom, that my pericranium seems to
be overshadowed with it. Now can I expect an answer to such unworthy stuff! Anne [insertion]Doyle[/insertion] begs I may [insertion]make[/insertion]
an apology for her being so troublesome as to request thou will call at Margt. Watson's New rm,
for a silk handkerchief which she left to be dyed.
Enquire what state the Foundling Hospital is in, & what description of children are admitted, &

I rejoice in thy joy, for I am certain that even the assemblage of Nature & Art wth thy ride showed thee will no more
put thee out of conicil with thy simple, native valley than the flats we lately saw together. Give my love to poor
Nurse Doyle, I hope she did not think hard of my not going out to speak to her. I get on slowly with my Annals
by reason of my other cares. Tho' the morning is wet, our stubborn Bees have not got up into the Hive yet
so that my mind is not at rest yet. I wish thou had seen Fr. Dell, as if he is not changed since I knew him
would be much to thy taste. My dear love to Jane Chandler
