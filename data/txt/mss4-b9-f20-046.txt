My dear Elith
Would [unclear]Allison[/unclear] give 3/4
per week for the house he may
have it at that rent I think
the new houses ought to be
something better worth than
the old ones, I am sorry
I gave thee so much trouble
about servants as after all
Edw does not approve of my
getting another from Ballitore
I am disappointed myself
as I thought I should have
nothing to do but write by
Henry Allen to have Biddy
Neville hired, now I think
asking Rich'd about the Stradbally
girl who took care of May
Wallaces children if it lay
in the way I wd. thank thee
to make enquiry about her
if it wd not be too much
trouble to write a note to her
Elizabeth Leadbeater
Ballitore

mistress asking if she were
cleanly & clever & willing
to do what she was bid
I am ashamed of troubling thee
again but I do not like hiring
a Dublin girl. I was sorry to
hear J H Brakes illness I
hope she is better before now
may be thou would know of
a suitable person [insertion]for a childs maid thy self[/insertion], Would
thou tell Deborah to send
me two stone of flour
the next opportunity for
myself & 1 for Elith if it
came in separate bags
so much the better
I may end my troublesome
letter, Duffy was here I told
him thou wert willing to
try Catherine he seem'd much
pleased, he is greatly to be
pitied having to marry without
a mother
It would be a pity to miss
Ellison for a tennant
even should he get the house
cheaper, but may be he wd
be satisfied to give 3/3
per week & get the floor
made himself I believe
Edw means to mention
the subject when he writes
to Eben by post that is to send
M G a letter to thee in thy
way ever thy SB
how are J Whites' family?
G Downes goes tomorrow
I send off this ugly scrap
with all its imperfections
on but its head
I may say that I am in
no hurry about the child's
maid as perhaps Ally may
recover strength sufficient
in time
ever thy SB
she is very quiet & decent
& as Edw will not let me get
another from Ballitore I mean to keep Catherine
who has the honor of belonging to that neighborhood
