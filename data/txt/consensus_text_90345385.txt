we took a walk down to the river and
along the new walk through the lower plantation.
Walked and talked after dinner. Georgina
played two very pretty tunes on the piano
the Prima donna waltz by Julien , and the
Olga or Favourite Polka by Harvey, both of which
I shall try to get I think when I have any
cash on hands.
4th - Papa went to town again this morning,
and Georgina with him, for she could
not well stay longer. The more I see of
her the more I like her, I think she is
a very nice girl indeed. This is Liddy's
birthday, I wish her many happy returns
of the day; I wonder what she is doing
now. I have just received a letter from
Polly saying their arrived quite safely, and
that she was going to keep Eliza the cook
she begged so much to stay.
Poor Nurse Acton who nursed Isabel died
yesterday of cholera after I believe a very short illness
