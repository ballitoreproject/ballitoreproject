Richmond 6/5 - 1827
My dear Sarah -
I have joyful news for
thee, since 4 oclock this morning Lydia has
been the mother of another daughter - L
is now as well as we could wish- she began
to complain (but only to [underline]me[/underline]) yesterday morning
and it was not untill my Father & the Summerville
family were in bed, that we called
aunt June, whom we succeeded in getting
without disturbing any one - she suffered
a good deal but bore it with her usual
patience, & was not alarmingly ill - and
she is now recompensed by a fine healthy
girl - we think her full as large as
[unclear]Seat Jorgy[/unclear] was and she resembles him very
much in features her name seems already
fixed - even [unclear]Jorgy[/unclear] calls her "sister [unclear]Hannah[/unclear]"

and seems much interested about her.
I am a good deal hurried, as thou may
suppose, and not the [unclear]more[/unclear] bright for
who having slept any last night, so I
hope thou wilt excuse all my [underline]muddy[/underline]
expressions. We had company to
dinner yesterday, who were no doubt
much astonished at hearing of this event
this morning, as to them Lydia appeared
in her usual health - James would
have written at least a part of this but
his banking business occupies him
closely - & he was obliged to go to town
without accomplishing it -
I am, my dear Sarah, in
haste thy very affte
[underline]S. Fisher[/underline]
If I have been deficient in my communications,
attribute it my dear Sarah,

to my want of practice in relating these
affairs - All goes on as well as we could
wish. Lydia sleeps a great deal, so does
the lusty girl - I writ to sister Hannah
by this days post - & shall write soon
again to one or both of you - My love
to Edward & the girls please -

For
[underline]Sarah[/underline]
