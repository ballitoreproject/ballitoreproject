4 Friday - Wet all day nearly -
5 Saturday, Papa staid out Charlie arrived
in time for tea - It was very pleasant
to see him safe back, and to hear about
the girls. He left them snugly settled
the girls. We left them snugly settled
in lodgings no 2 Beacon Terrace looking
out on the sea - Aunt Liddy with them
Now we must only look forward with
hope - Wet also -
6 Sunday - Went to meeting with Papa
and Phil - Saw Aunt Martha and Uncle
Manliffe at Glendruid for a wonder -
Grandmama seemed pretty well -
No company here to day - Charlie read
me some good advice from - "A Serious Call"
by Law - Would that I could follow
it - Had a fine long interesting letter
from Lyd - another from [underline]Annie[/underline] Box enclosing
me the patterns - (it was so kind of her
to remember them) - and another from
Jane Penrose inviting me to a little party
on Tuesday evening - Cha has gone
over to Ballyman with Phil to night
such a stormy one as it is - but not cold
