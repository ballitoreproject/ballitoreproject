altho a mind so tossed at times as mine cannot
produce any thing worth the perusal of my [insertion]Dr[/insertion] Molly
whom I love with I hope I may [deletion]with[/deletion] [insertion]say with[/insertion] a degree of the
fathers love, I say tho this is the situation of my mind
yet I was loath to omit the favorable opportunity per
Joseph Grub who attends his sisters or kindly bears them
Company thy favour I may truly say was not only acceptable
but edifying as it manifested I had some little place in the
remembrance of some one of my Beloved friends, but me oh
worthless me what am I a poor creature but then why should
I complain to one that feels stripping times her self but
it may be necessary if we expect change of raiment & that
renewed to us as thou knows old Garments are not pleasant
especially if they are so old as to get into rags thou knows
we read of filthy rags, I am sure my Dear Molly tho she
wears mean things likes them whole & clean, & therefore
wou'd like to be clad in that Garment that is called the Rightousness
of saints but oh the seeking after it with all the
heart is the mean thing but tho the people love it and love

them that are in the full pursuit of it & why so because it
is lovely in their views, but then why dont they seek after
it themselves if I was to ask thee this which is not I believe
my first time or something like it what wou'd be the reply
oh me I am not worthy but my dear Molly by reasoning [deletion]&[/deletion]
there is often reserved making under plausable pretinces too
as thou knows was the case formerly but what was the end
nothing agreable but that which soon terminated in sorrow
I know thou art one that comes very near the apostle's advice
which is if I remember for [insertion]each to[/insertion] esteem others better than t[unclear][/unclear]
& this I now think may be carried a little too far for by
themselves of no use either in a civil or religious society the
Enemy may get in that is never of his watch & make us
believe we shall never be fit for any thing that will tend to
our peace or the praise of him who wou'd favour with strength
& ability to withstand his discouraging attempts or assaults
I know he has often attacked me in this way & sometimes
gained his point casting me down almost before hope, and
thereby I was often left in a state of darkness & doubting so
that we had need when a little fresh help is administered to us
from the pure fountain to make use of it & store it up against
an assault or attack of the like kind & perhaps by the right
use of that thou may be favourd to add a little more to it till thou

may gather so much strength as to say [unclear]get thou[/unclear] behind me oh mine Enemy thou
[unclear]savest[/unclear] not the things that be of God & a word to the may be sufficient especially
from such a poor ignorant Creature as thou knows I am I had no view when I sat down
of being led after this manner but thou knows paper will take any thing, I hope to receive
a few lines from thee per the Bearer — Dear Betty Tuke now here & desires dear love to thee
now concerning the Baragin I wrote by Joseph Inman to Saml. Warring & I understand
by S Grub he got it in London but no answer to it perhaps he thought I was gone
I think it wou'd be best for thee to write to him direct to Saml. Warring Aulton Hampshire
— — my Dear Companion Unites in Dear love to thee, & wou'd also to many of our
Dear friends but wou'd not like this shou'd expres'd farewell my Dear Molly may
Best wisdom & strength attend thee says thy sincerely affect. yet poor little
no tidings of dear [unclear]Salt[/unclear] yet
