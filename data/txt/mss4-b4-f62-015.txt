Upon settling my papers a little I find a
letter from thee, my dear sister, & altho' written
in the 6th month, it feel quite fresh: - it encouraged
my going with Mary Dudley, which I hope
I had no cause to repent of, - thou says, & I
wish [underline]thee[/underline] to experience it so, for I could say
nothing more to [insertion]my[/insertion] mind than thy own words
viz., - "& by the efficacy of even a grain of
"pure faith the mountains be cast as into
"the sea, & the sycamore tree be removed there."
Ah I know! or however believe, that it is no
trivial thing to be born or bring forth, but how
wonderfully hast [underline]thou[/underline] been helped through 10
times, & I trust wilt not be forsaken in the
11th by [underline]Him[/underline] who sticketh closer than a [underline]sister[/underline]
It matters not saying much on the subject
of my absence this time, if we meet at the
Dublin meeting (which I am in hopes we will)
we may talk it over. We shall rejoice to
hear of it being over, & hope dear brother Saml.
will not fail of soon informing us. I found
Richd. gone when I came home, - we miss him
considerably, tho' he weaned us from him, I
expect he is both helpful & a comfort to
thee. My mother is very weakly, yet I hope
1 1794

hope not worse than of late. The rest of us bravely.
If thou thinks on maybe thou would remember
us affectionately to our friends there, mine to MD
particularly, I [underline]was[/underline] disappointed in her not coming
here: & a good deal so is not getting to take
leave of dear Betty Grubb, whom it was pleasant
to see. If possible, [underline]fear not[/underline] my beloved sister,
I do not fear about thee, I feel very comfortable
in thinking how delightfully thou wilt get
through, to thy own humble thankful admiration
as heretofore. Most cordially & affectionately
farewell.
