to your social circle? I remember very well, taking
tea with her & a large party at thy sister Sally's, the
summer before I bid adieu to Ballitore, how little
did I then imagine that the Atlantic would ever roll
between us! however, I still hope to join your hospitable
board, & appear in the important character of
a hero - to narrate my own travels & adventures.
I am sorry thou asks my opinion of the Queen
as I apprehend it differs from yours. Whilst I detest
the ill usage & persecution which she has met with, ever
since her fatal marriage - & condemn most strongly the
Ministry for bringing forward the disgusting trial; yet
I must say, that the testimony of her [underline]own witnesses[/underline]
was sufficient in itself to convince me of her guilt.
It would have required, perhaps, more than mortal
strength to have resisted the temptations to which she
was exposed, & therefore Mercy pities, while Justice condemns
her. - The Eclipse which thou mentions on 9 mo 7.
was not visible here, & ergo we did not see it! -
I have now answered thy letter in order,
& shall proceed to other subjects.
Since I last wrote to thee I have travelled
a great deal thro' many of the States & consequently
I acquired a more practical knowledge of the Country,
than I possessed before. - In the latter end of 7. mo.
I left Newyork for the Falls of Niagara & Canada, and

spent six weeks in a most delightful manner. - The
Western [deletion]part[/deletion] [insertion]section[/insertion] of this State is highly improved, & parts of
it, have nearly lost the appearance of a new Country.
Some of the towns are beautifully situated, & well built.
The smaller Lakes are highly picturesque, affording innumerable
spots for country seats, & I dare say, twenty years
hence, they will be surrounded by gentlemen farmers.
The Falls of Niagara absolutely exceeded my lofty anticipations,
& I cannot conceive it possible for any rational
person to be disappointed with them.. Thou hast so
frequently read the descriptions that travellers have
drawn of this mighty cataract, I shall not impose
a fresh one upon thee. - I may just remark, in this
place, that I sent home last spring, my Journal
of perhaps 200 pages, taken during that tour, as I thought
(without possessing intrinsic merit) it might afford some
slight gratification to my friends, to peruse the narrative
of my adventures. - It it should ever travel as far
as Ballitore, thou would, may be, turn over the leaves
for the sake of the writer, & there thou wilt find
a tame description of the sublime scenery, thro' which
I wandered for a few days. -
Already I hear of several
Parties, formed for this summer, to Niagara & Canada,
& gladly would I, if it were possible, become the the "Cicerone"
to one or other of them, because the tour will
bear repeating, with scarcely a decrease of interest &
delight. - It wants but the magic of Poetry to render

the ground classic, & all would be complete. - If
[underline]names[/underline] could inspire the soil, there would be no lack
of Homers or Virgils; - for, with a singular incongruity
the learned Citizens, whose task it was to divide the
western section into townlands, countries, &c, have drawn
largely upon the deposits of Antiquity, until there
remains not either an illustrious Greek or Roman,
whose memory is not cherished by the name of a
[underline]wooden[/underline] village, or a [underline]woody[/underline] township. - In Embryo, however,
are yet our Byrons, Scotts or Moores, but if
we believe the sage predictions of sundry newspaper
commentators, the day is not far distant, when the
Independence of American intellect, from foreign literature,
will be effected, by a profuse supply of domestic
manufacture!.. There is one periodical publication
in this Country, which at present enjoys a large share
of public patronage, & is daily rising in estimation.
it is published in Boston under the title of the
“North American Review,” & comes out quarterly. -
I have met with it occasionally, & admire its
style. - & I do not think it is improperly National
in its feelings, when discussing subjects that call
forth opinions upon American & European affairs. -
Of course, articles frequently appear in it, of no great
merit, but this must be also admitted of the Edinburgh
& Quarterly Reviews - & therefore the exception is not peculiar

On the whole, Literature is making a slow, but I
think [underline]sure[/underline] progress in America, & becomes annually
more fashionable. As people grow rich, a middle
or idle class will be formed here, who, if they do
not themselves advance learning & a taste for science,
will at least, from a proper pride, give their children
a liberal education, & enable them to enjoy
the rational pursuits of Knowledge. - I know a
great many men in this City who had not themselves
the advantages of an extended education, but who nevertheless
contrived to court & win the favor of the
blind Goddess - & now that they are rich, they tacitly
acknowledge their deficiencies, & seem determined to
open a brighter path for their children. -
Philadelphia & Boston rank before Newyork in a literary
way, as much as Newyork does before them, in
a commercial point of view. - In the former, particularly,
a very good literary circle is to be found,
& a gentleman who is furnished with proper letters
of Introduction, will experience no difficulty, in passing
his time there agreeably.- It will perhaps
surprise thee to hear that Newyork affords no, even-tolerable
Reading room, except one in a private
book store, where most of the periodical publications
-but not regularly - are to be had. - There is a Library
on shares, which is open from 10 ’till 2 o.f., & subscribers
have the privilege of taking books home from it to read.
