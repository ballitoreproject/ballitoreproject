My dear Sarah
I am sure you have had good reason to
think I had forgotten you I suppose you expected an answer immediately
which I really had written but having mentioned something about
my aunt's bonnet not being come I was afraid Betsy might think
it [deletion]was[/deletion] [insertion]had[/insertion] not [deletion]come[/deletion] as it just came as I was going to send my letter
I am very sorry Mrs Whyte is not yet recovered I never heard of poor
little Richard's death Nor of Deborah going to Mt- Melick Nor [insertion]of[/insertion] the
Miss Chandlees being robbed I hope Mrs Whyte does not fret much
after Richard. Here we are in Portobellow at my aunt's or rather in
mud island in dirty Dublin I am not like Miss Chandler who
even loves the dirt of Dublin What will become of the Ballitore
Magazine now that Deborah is gone to school I suppose you being
the next to her have taken her place for Margaret could not

possibly write all herself Marianne Fitzsimmons has been a
long time with [insertion]you[/insertion] I should have written to Elizabeth long ago
I intended to take the opportunity when your father and Eben
were going to Ballitore I began a letter to her and spoiled it
and then I had not time to write another however I will write
to her I expect immediately I hope J Lenon's children are
well particularly little Jane I expect Harriet's kittens (or perhaps
cats as they must [insertion]have[/insertion] grown since we left the country) are very fond
of Ebenezer I hope neither of them are grownd yet [deletion]or any[/deletion] [insertion]and[/insertion] no
misfortune has befallen them How is Betsy's school going
on I am sure she can't have much time to attend to it while she
is so much employed with Mrs Whyte Hannah I suppose is
growing very tall I hope you may be able to read this I am
in a great hurry as my aunt is going to leave this at Charlem[insertion]ont [/insertion]
[unclear][/unclear] Bessy joins with me in love to you and all the
Ballitorians Yrs Sincerely [unclear]JC[/unclear]
love to Elizabeth
