care of those fine creatures you allude
to - My father &c not yet returned

you have made all ready for our [unclear][/unclear]
as regarding the providing a horse to
[underline]Enniscorfy[/underline] is coming fast so prepare prepare
I send your wearables & bearer & expect!!!
that Smith has fitted you to a degree,
I also return the neck cloth --- If you come
here on Friday or Saturday you may witness
the launching of the Ellen Douglass, [unclear][/unclear]
ceremony is to take place at 9 or 10 o/c
PM - we intend having a grand Fete on
the occasion, such as firing a Royal salute
of 21 guns on board, Music &c &c. - If you come
you wont be sorry I verily believe you
never witness'd such a scene - all we want
to complete the business, is having a person w[unclear][/unclear]
practical talent to transmit a version thereof.
