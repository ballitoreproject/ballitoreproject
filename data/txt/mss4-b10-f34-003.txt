Dearest Wife
I am glad
you are coming
home on Monday
- I have been long
enough without
you - I hope
you dont think
of going to
Orange Hill
while Mary Jane
is away -
I was over yesterday
evening
- baby seems
very well - has
grown fatter &
bigger & was in
very good spirits
and is rather better

at the walking.
Have the apples
reached you yet
& are they good?
- I have not yet
opened the fellow
barrel -
No more until
I see you
ever yours
