Lisburn June 19th 1815
My dear Friend
I am sorry I cannot, in reply to thy
letter, give any information relative to getting straw
&c from England. My Father thinks thou might
gain some information by applying to William Corston,
Ludgate hill, London; he is extensive in the
trade, & has published some essays on the subject.
I am not surprized to hear that you cannot induce
many to plait, as it is extremely difficult to persuade
the poorer classes to follow any new plans, or to depart
from their old habits. I think it must be difficult
to get the plait done clean, as unfortunately the
Irish are too negligent of the virtues of cleanliness &
tidiness; yet I believe they are not singular. If the
"Cottagers of Glenburnie" is a correct delineation of Scotch
manners & habit, & I have every reason to think it
is from credible travellers, & from observation of the
Scotch settlers in this part of Ireland, the Scotch cannot
reproach us, & I do not know sufficient of the poorer

classes in England & Wales to enable me to form an
opinion respecting them. They at least have more the
exterior of cleanliness. I recollect on my return home
after a visit to England, contrasting the neatness of the
English with the hideous appearance of a woman
whom we met shortly after landing; national vanity
then received a blow which has made me ever
since rather afraid to defend the Irish. She was [insertion]possessed of[/insertion] the
of the most forbidding exteriors I ever beheld as to countenance;
she was barefooted & barelegged; she had
neither cap nor coat, & her long uncombed hair fell
in disorder over her shoulders. In short any person
might naturally suppose she was some savage being,
placed by mistake in a civilized country. -
I am glad to hear that your Lancastrian
schools continue to prosper. I do not expect these
schools will act as charms to dispel at once the
mists of ignorance, but I think they may be useful
in laying the foundation for improvement.
Many of the parents of the children are not sufficiently
convinced of the benefits of education, & they
are too ready to keep their children at home on frivolous
excuses, but these children may gain so much

instruction as to make them regret in some future
day, that they had not been more solicitous to improve
themselves. I have been frequently at the Lancastrian
schools in Belfast; the school for boys is uncommonly
well conducted. The teacher in the school
for girls is incompetent to the task she has undertaken.
I happened accidentally to be in Belfast on
the 14th, when the examinations at the Academical
Institutions commenced & on being invited to attend, Betsy,
William & I spent an hour there. The schools are large,
as it is the most fashionable seminary for the education
of the children of the wealthy classes. The
examinations commenced by a boy of 10 years
of age making a latin oration; his action & manner
were very graceful; a second boy was then called, who
[deletion]made[/deletion] [insertion]repeated[/insertion] a long speech from Julius Caesar. One of the managers
then spoke in favour of public education -
He told us he reverenced the man who devoted his time
to the education of his children, but in the present
state of manners this character was rare & to prevent
boys from being spoiled by the gluttony of the dining
room, the insincerity of the drawing room, the vulgarity
of servants, & the contamination of the stable he
recommended a public education.
We do not take the Farmer's Journal. My Father
did not like the spirit of servility in the prospectus.
I wrote to Betsy Shackleton last week by Mary

Harvey - In that letter I mentioned having had a long letter
from T. Houlbrooke, in which he dwells much on his comfortable
situation. Of Miss Balfour, I can say little. I have
never seen her, but her character has been much impeached
in some transactions relative to her brother's failure. Besides,
from all I hear of her, she is one with whom I should never wish
to be acquainted. I was induced by a friend of hers to request subscriptions
for her poems, & had I known as much of her friend then as I now do I
would not have complied with the request - By all accounts of Miss Balfour, I should
think if [deletion][/deletion] had apartments to share, he might invite her to live
with them, & perhaps she might prove useful in forwarding his [deletion][/deletion]
My Father is not better, his breathing is much worse for some
days past, & the damp weather we have lately had has tended to
increase his rheumatism - William & Betsy are well - Robert is at
present at Carrickfergus paying a visit -
Please remember me affectionately to Elizabeth and
Deborah, & tell thy father that if she & Eben go to England by way
of Scotland, [deletion]that[/deletion] my Father desires me to say we will be pleased to see
them in Lisburn - I am truly & sincerely thine S Hancock
My Father would be much obliged to thee
to let him have an account of the money thou
paid Lees on thy account & that of M Trench
during 1814, as the [unclear]proprietors[/unclear] of the Magazine
cannot get settled with him -
