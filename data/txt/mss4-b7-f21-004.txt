The Garden will sustain no injury by having the Lillies
gather'd, therefore my benevolent Friend may be gratified in
healing all her wounded Neighbours. The Leaves are to be
put singly into Spirits, & one of them applied to any wounded
part.
Yrs Affectionately JS
Lest our motive for keeping the Garden lock'd, should be misunderstood,
I beg to tell you my dear Friend, that the Catch of the
Gate is so loose, it will not keep the Gate shut. Yrs. Sincerely
JS
