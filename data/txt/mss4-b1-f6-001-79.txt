Dear Miss Shackleton
Obedience being the first principal of a Soldier,
I with great chearfulness execute the commands
of my first master, and your father, by
informing you he is in good health here, & purposes
[unclear]prosecuting[/unclear] his journey to London tomorrow morning;
he surprizd me in bed [deletion][/deletion] this morning, I need
not say it was an agreeable surprize; as I hope you
are already convinc'd of my affection for him, &
his family; he obliginly eat his dinner with me
and my little wife, who is as much pleas'd with his
acquaintance, as she was before with his character
it is now by his wish I write, as business of one
sort or other prevented him, tho' it was his intention.
Now don't say, its my father I thank for this
letter, & not T: E: - It was my intention fully
[unclear]to[/unclear] write to you previous to my leaving this; which
will be in the course of a few days, for [underline]Bath[/underline],
having
