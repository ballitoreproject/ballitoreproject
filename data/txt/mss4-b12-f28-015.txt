 My dearest Mama
I wrote from London
Wednesday night saying we
intended leaving it next
morning for this place -
wh. we did at 8-20 yesterday
arriving here at 6-20 PM
last evening - we had
the same companion the
whole way. , an entertaining
German & two Ladies
wh. we think were English
although one of them
seemed to have been almost
all over the world -
& came [underline]here[/underline] because I
knew the place although
it has a different owner
we are much more comfortable
& at a cheaper place

than Mrs [unclear]Burns[/unclear]
Albert likes the city here
better than London
wh he is tired of already
so only for Uncle Thomas
we would not have
come on here.
We went over a good deal
of it to day. Our time is
so short we must be
smart we leave on
Monday for London
We had [underline]tremendous[/underline]
[underline]rain[/underline] coming yesterday
evening also to night
but to day was [underline]lovely[/underline]
& I brought Albert to the
top of the Pantheon so
he saw all over Paris
& 40 miles round -

Lucies few lines were all
I got from any body since
I left Ireland I wish
I knew more about how
you are getting on
How art thou & Papa keeping
up -? You have one another
still & comfort each other
The only way I can console
my self for the loss of
dear Fanny is that I
know & feel sure she
is with our Saviour whom
she loved & wished
[underline]us[/underline] to love too - but
I feel a terrible blank
for I was [underline]always[/underline]
thinking what I would
& could do for her
I do not know what Albert

will do, he feels in a
terrible way at times
& I know nothing but
"Time[deletion]s[/deletion]" will heel the
wound bleeding in
his heart if it ever
heals: no one could be
long in our company
without knowing we
felt sorrow of some
kind -
Are the Penrose's going
down to you I suppose I
had better go home
as soon as I return
or shall I see what Albert
is going to do [deletion][/deletion] he
says he could not stay house
keeping at 132, It wd be
more than he could bear
love to all I post this in the
morning for you to get Monday

ever thy affec daughter Emily [underline]do write[/underline]
[underline]to me[/underline]
