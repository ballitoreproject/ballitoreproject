4 Friday - Still no improvement in Charlie.
The doctor is afraid of low fever setting in -
Towards evening however he quite brightened
up and seemed hardly sick enough when
the [underline]two[/underline] doctors arrived - Papa thought
it safer to get Doctor Duke - so he came
out by the 4Â½ train -
5 Saturday -. Poor Charlie was very middling
this morning and we[deletion]nt[/deletion] sent for Doctor Darby -
but he could not come soon enough to
give him much relief - so when the medicine
arrived this evening he was not so well -
6 Sunday - A restless night poor Charlie had -
and is very middling this morning - The
doctors came early - he [underline]has[/underline] low fever they say,
so it must take its course - I hope all will
go on well - we are anxious of course
6 Sunday - Cha not any better - Ned called
on his way to meeting, Papa and Mary [insertion]and [underline]Dick[/underline][/insertion]
The doctors came early - I took a walk
with Papa and Mary home got some things
and back with Miss Stuart - found Uncle
Arthur here on my return - John called
also in the course of the day and Jenny
also in the course of the day and Jemmy
