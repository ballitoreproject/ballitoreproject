I fear you will almost think that I have forgotten my poor children and
not received your last kind letter, which contained so clear and exact an account
of the wise manner in which you have expended and husbanded my money.
I feel myself most highly obliged, and the children will certainly rise
up and call you blessed. I am very glad to find that James is able to keep
his mothers accounts, when old enough I hope she will take him into business
and I very much approve his learning to make shoes, I should be very glad if
he could make his Brothers and his Sisters shoes, and if you were good enough
to give him a little trifle for every pair he made it would be a great encouragement
to him, as to owen I should be glad to know what you think he must be put to,
Shall he be a laborer or in a trade - I should wish him to be taught knitting,
we teach it to our little Boys, and it is quite pleasant to see them employed
after they have learned their lessons, in knitting Stockings and Garters.
you perhaps have observed by the english news papers that Mr: Smith has
lost his Election for Norwich, and is out of parliament, this has been a
Dear Elizabeth
with every good wish for your happiness and that of every Individual of your family.
I remain with great regard & esteem your

a great mortification to as at this period when the death blow, is we flatt[unclear][/unclear]
ourselves, about to be given, to that vile traffic in our fellow creatures the
African [deletion][/deletion] slave trade. Mr. Smith not being in the House, has expressed
his sentiments on this subject in a letter addressed to Mr. Wilbeforce which
I shall be very happy to send you. I fear you have not yet had Lancasters
Books, but perhaps you have by this time had Lancaster himself
in Ireland. It would give me the greatest pleasure to hear that his Schoo[unclear][/unclear]
were erected all over your Country, nothing would tend so much to [unclear]amelio[/unclear]
the condition of your poor. He has lately met with some opposition here
from a Mrs. [unclear]Stimmer[/unclear], a very good kind of woman, and a very useful one,
but much mistaken in this instance, he has written her a very spirited letter
which perhaps I may have it in my power to send.
So tell me where your Nephew whom you mention in your last letter now is _
In what part of London does he reside?_ our friend Thomas Wilkinson I
have not lately heard from, he is a very tardy correspondent and so am I, but
I hear that he is much with Lord Lowther, by whose means he is enabled
to do much good, and to do good is the life of his life._
I have enclosed [insertion]the half of a [/insertion] ten pound[deletion]s[/deletion] [insertion]note[/insertion] for the use of the children, which I am sure you will
employ to the best advantage. the other half I will send when I hear from you that this[unclear][/unclear]
safely arrived.
