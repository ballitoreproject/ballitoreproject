From Richard Shackleton to the Earl of Aldborough


        I think myself much obliged by my kind friend Lord Aldboroughs attention & politeness. I am well aware that the various prejudices of education operate forcibly upon our minds, & give our sentiments & habits different colours; while the great law of Right & Wrong remains invariably the same& this great law, in my opinion, is the pure & generous spirit of Christianity imprest on the mind of every true Christian, & left upon record in the writings of the New Testament; a book, whose authenticity & authority we all allow. I am very sensible that a deal has been said & written in justification of theatrical entertainments & of many other amusements & recreations, which corrupt custom has established  but to me they appear ^altogether^ inconsistent with the spirit which vital Christianity breathes, & with the general tendency of the sacred records which I have mentioned. And in this judgment I am by no means single, nor singular: many wise & worthy men of most respectable & religious characters, have condemned the vanity & folly of stage-plays, as profane & unchristian; & I supposed the church of England as by law established extends ecclesiastical censure to the actors in such diversions  But Custom & Fashion prevail in this & many other cases both against Reason & Religion.
        I remember also having received a note from Lord Aldborough, a considerable time ago, on the subjects of keeping on the hat, & musick  I had intended to have made some reply to it, but divers avocations prevented. I am very conscious of the singular appearance of so constantly wearing the hat; & do not wonder that it gives disgust & offence, though it is by no means designed. The act of uncovering the head seems to have been appointing^ed^ (according to the apostle Pauls [page number] 348 [sic] doctrine) in the primitive Christian church, as a token of men preaching & praying in publick assemblies by divine appointment inspiration; as the act of covering the head on like occasions in such places was prescribed to the women. We theref Quakers therefore think it improper to pay to man that mark of worship which is appropriated to God: & we also apprehend it our duty, by keeping our heads covered, to bear our testimony against these occasional cursory forms of prayer & thanksgiving sometimes uttered in our presence, which do not lay claim to the sanction of that divine inspiration, but we believe to be of those vain repetitions which Christ Jesus forbade  But if there were not these testimonies to be borne, which indeed spring from a religion root; yet why should not a man, if he please, wear his hat upon his head, as well as his shoes upon his feet? If no one be incommoded by it, why should any ^one^ be offended with it?  Tis perhaps not the custom or fashion at present, in these countries, to wear the hat generally within doors  but a Christian man is not to adopt implicitly the manners of the world  The prophet under the law tells us, The customs of the people are vain  The great apostle under the gospel says, The fashion of this world passeth away: and, Be not conformed to this world  And Christ declared to his followers that they are not of the world (i.e of the spirit of the world:) but that he had chosen them out of the world: therefore the world hated them: & further expressly says, That which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.
        As to MusickI allow that in the Jewish dispensation, it was used in their religious rites & ceremonies: But a far more glorious (Gospel) day has beamed upon us  in which those types & shadows of good things which were to come are abolished; & sensations of a more exalted, refined & spiritual nature are introduced  Yet even under the law, the prophets & holy men gave ample testimony that it was only a life of purity & righteousness which was acceptable to the Almighty: & musick as an instrument of luxury & voluptousness [sic] is particularly reprobated, Ye that put far away the evil day, & cause the seat of violence to come near, that lie upon beds of ivory, & stretch themselves upon their couches, & eat the lambs out of the flock, & the calves out of the midst of the stall: that chant to the sound of the viol, & invent to themselves instruments of musick like David, that drink wine in bowls, & anoint themselves with the chief ointments: but they are not grieved for the affliction of Joseph  And what manner of persons we, who profess Christianity should be; what kind of gratification we should cultivate, I will let the apostle Paul himself say: See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise; redeeming the time, because the days are evil. Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is: & be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess, but be filled with the Spirit, speaking to yourselves in psalms & hymns, & spiritual songs, singing & making melody in your hearts to the Lord  Nay the very heathens enlightened whether by nature or grace consent that it is a good life, which is the most acceptable offering to Heaven  & thy own favourite poet Horace himself, though so passionate an admirer of what are called the fine arts, after all is obliged to come to this conclusion.

        Nimirm sapere est abjectis utile nugis,
        Et tempestivum pueris concedere ludum,
        Ae non verba sequi fidibus modulanda Latinis
        Sed verae numerasquae, modosque ediscere vitae.

I subjoin Franciss version of the passage, because I think its peculiar elegance, so seldom to be met with in poetical translations, will please thee.
        Tis Wisdoms part to bid adieu to toys,
        And leave amusement to the taste of boys;
        Not the soft sounds of empty words admire,
        And model measures to the Roman lyre,
        But learn those strains & rhapsodies, which roll
        Serene through life, & harmonize the soul.


I wish Lord Aldborough & Lady Hannah health & happiness, & all Christian consolation, without which the pageantry & bustle of this world is flat & insipid, & am
        very respectfully
                thy sincere friend
                        Richard Shackleton
