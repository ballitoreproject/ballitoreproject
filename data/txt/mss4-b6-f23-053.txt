O Wit, it is delusive
And Humour often leads astray
Then choose goodness, dear Nephew
I will lead thee in a safer way
And thou, the bonnier Lassie
Our secret banks & glens among
To please thy youthful fancy
The aged Muse attempts a song.
But as the task is new, the Muse
Requests should brevity excuse.
