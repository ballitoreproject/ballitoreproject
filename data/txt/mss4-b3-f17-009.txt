My dear Friend,
        Sincere regard will not allow me to neglect thy kind invitation of renewing our correspondence, besides, now that our account is settled, and that I am proved to be the debtor, I cannot withhold even the little I possess towards discharging the debt
        We all regretted thy sudden & unexpected departure from London, it was particularly painful to me, as I have not those frequent opportunities of intercourse with you my earliest Friends, that others of my family have, & I still recur to you, for true, genuine friendship, which has not source or view but the promotion, or, the wish for the promotion of solid and everlasting peace
        I rejoice that my dear Aunt Pike accomplished her journey to so much satisfaction. May we not hope that it will operate as an inducement to thy good Wife to follow her example, and that we may be gratified by having her once more amongst us. Pray assure her of my respectful regard. I remember the expression in Abrahams letter in which he would constrain us to love him, tell him we do it voluntarily & not him only, but, his dear Wife and all that is his share my near affection, I must also trouble thee to salute my faithful friend Deborah with an assurance of unabated affection, & if I may yet incroach [sic] upon thy patience let me bring Mary & Sarah into the group of those whom I wish to know I love them
        I have no doubt but poor Jenny Fullers fall would affect thee very sensibly, exclusive of other more important considerations she exhibits a humiliating proof of human frailty.
        David Lindoe [sic] surprised his Friends last week by marrying a young woman whom he had formerly been acquainted with at Norwich. I fancy it is a reputable connection his Uncle Barclay seems much affected by it, indeed he has little but mortification, from those that he has so kindly endeavoured to sustain above their adverse fortune
        I understand that we are likely to lose five of the American Friends next weekRebekah Jones & Christy Hustler are expected in this County & at this house very soon, which I am glad of, for I have not yet any of Rebekahs company and there is a certain something in her mien, that leads one to suppose her of the first order
        Mary Ridgeway & Jane Watson were at Milverton last week, they have lately lost one of the Scholars which has been a trial to those concerned in the School. I understand that Priscy Gurney renders herself very useful there in quality of Grammar MistressI am pleased that your schools promise so wellMy dear Agatha begs thy acceptance of her loveFarewell my dear Friend!
        Believe me, thy truly affectionate & obliged
                Hannah Pim
