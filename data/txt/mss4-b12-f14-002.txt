Sometime back, about 3
weeks since, in reading a
volume of "Jay's Morning and
Evening Exercises," a perforated
Card dropped out, having on
one side, in your hand-writing,
the words - "Glendruid - 6 o'clock
precisely - Oct. 7, 1843," and on
the reverse was my name, in
Martha's hand-writing. The
Card must have lain there
for the last 15 years. It puzzled
me greatly to understand what
it referred to, so I brought it
to Dublin, and in case Martha
were not able to unravel

the mystery I had intended
to make her send it to you
& ask for an explanation; -
she, however, at once told me
the meaning of it - it was
an Invitation to the celebrated
"[underline]Pine-Apple Dinner[/underline]." Of course,
I was absent - else I should
have recollected it. - I had
almost forgotten to tell you
that my dear Mary is about
to be married - the 13th of next
month the day appointed - to
a Mr Prim, the gentleman who
succeeded me in my former
Establishment - a young man
of [underline]most excellent[/underline] character
- a good son and brother, & I
must say, if she be not happy,
the fault will not be his -
I have known him from his
infancy, & he [deletion][/deletion] edited "The
Moderator" for upwards of nine
years before I gave it up -
curious enough, she is going
back to the house in which
she was born, & in which
I used to be giving my "Dear Di"
lessons in Short-hand. Now,
even if I have tired out your
patience I have determined on
adding a few lines more, as
I know they will afford you

pleasure. [unclear]I[/unclear] happy to tell
you, dear Eliza, that Providence
has been most kind to me
since we last met, in wonderfully
restoring my health -
I am now able to exercise
without fatigue, & have got
rid of the violent palpitations
of my heart, & other annoying
symptoms - I hope to tell you
all about my recovery when
next we meet, please God -
Now, for the present farewell -
my best wishes & regards to your
husband - & believe me, dear "Di"
with unaltered esteem & affection,
Your old friend,
Abrm Denroche
