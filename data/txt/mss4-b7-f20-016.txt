great a liberty in so doing. My eldest
Son & Daughter are spending the winter
in Italy, my youngest Son is just
returned home after an absence of a year
& a half in Germany for education -
he made during the vacation a pedestrian
Tour through Germany of nearly a thousand
miles - I am expecting my two married
daughters Mrs Nicholson & Mrs Carter with
their three little boys to join
our family party at Xmas
[unclear][/unclear] him we generally have a
gathering of the whole clan. at least
all who are within reach make a point
of visiting the parents just at that time.
I will send your Books this week or next
to Bartholemew Close & I hope you will
pardon me for keeping them so long when
you find it was in order to collect all
the opinions I could relating to them
Believe me to be with my very sincere regard
& esteem your Friend
Frances Smith -
