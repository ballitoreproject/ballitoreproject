Ballitore: 4/1 month: 1788

I am in debt to many dear & precious correspondents, who have favoured me with their letters  I think I am not indebted in that way to thee: and yet I seem to want to salute thee, my dear friend, & to visit thee indisposed & confined to thy chamber (sick & in prison) - thou seemst from these circumstances of thy situation, & from the obligation of permanent friendship to be entitled to a visit of this sort, even before my beloved Peggy. But should I be deficient in this outward visible sign (which yet I think would not be right) I trust thou would, at some time seasons feel that I had by no means forgot thee  thou hast divers friends here who do not receive the accounts of thy sufferings with unconcern & indifference, but are deeply interested on thy behalf. But such is the lot of human nature in general, & such is the lot of the followers & disciples of Christ  these events are common to all  Wide, however, is the difference between the righteous & the wicked in this respect  those know the chastisements of a paternal hand, acknowledge the evil as well as the good to be administered from the same source in infinite wisdom, & witness all to be sanctified for their use: & themselves in body, soul & spirit to be sanctified to the Lord & his use - but these, when affliction come upon them, have nothing to lay hold on, they stagger & are at their wits end - if the rod be for a while suspended, yet divine displeasure remains as long as unrepented guilt remains, & when the cup of life is exhausted, the dregs [page number] 258 of sin & all its horrours will be found at the bottom, unless washed away by time by ^& sincere^ repentance

[pencil note] x
There is a fine (I wont say an enviable) group of you there, ^SS^ if you properly cultivated a mutual intercourse, one would think ye might do each other much good  but perhaps ye are each walking in your own solitary track, each wading in your own deep, each having a baptism to be baptized with, & straitened till it be accomplished. Well, mourn apart, my dear friends, - & may you have at seasons to rejoice together under the shadow of the Beloved of souls, feasting on the fruit of your faithfulness & entire dedication, & through gracious condescension eating your morsel sweet as if earned by honest labour. +++
Farewell
R Shackleton
