19th.. Seventh day - Took a very pleasant
tho' lonely ride early this morning
The weather from being very cold
has become quite mild again.
Before two O'clock Liddy took a race
with me down to Betty Byrne's
to whom we wanted to give a
piece of flannel. there is no longer
any or at least much sign of their
old cabin - it being cleared away
and men are now levelling the
neighbouring hedge -
20th.. A lovely morning, but very
cold indeed. Went to meeting
with Philip and Liddy - and was
very glad to see Polly there. After
meeting we went to Glenagary instead
stead of Glendruid as Polly had
to fill up some notice relating to
the "coming event" - On our
way, Polly and I called to see
Mary White at De Vesci lodge - only
paid a very short visit. Philip
