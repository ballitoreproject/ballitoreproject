I took kind thy writing to me, my beloved sister Margaret, &
it was respecting thee, as I wished & believed, even that of not
taking unkind my not particularly addressing thee by letter:
I [underline]thought[/underline] we loved & understood each other better than so, &
yet I knew not how to bear the thought of [underline]seeming[/underline] to be indifferent
about thee, or thine:– Ah my precious Anne! I often
think of her, & we often speak of her,– the thought of never
seeing her again goes to my heart, for my own sake, for she
was lovely & pleasant to me, but not for her's, believing it
would be a happy release to her [underline]struggling spirit[/underline]. Perhaps
eer now tho', she may be restored to health,– my dear dear love
is to her. Though two months since I met with the accident
thou alludes to, I am still unable to do much with the hand,
the swelling & weakness continuing in the wrist,– the bone
in the arm I apprehend is knit,– but I doubt whether the
arm will be quite straight, this is of no consequence, unless
it tends to its being weaker & more subject to be effected
by change of weather. I observe thy motherly hints respecting
my [underline]taking care[/underline] about my return home,– I [underline]am[/underline] often
under sore discouragements, from [underline]various causes[/underline];– but
perhaps 'tis best keep quiet, & ponder those things in my heart
My

My [underline]faithful[/underline] companion sends my brother, thee, & your children
dear love:– we would both wish our many friends there-a-way
to know that we love & remember them, take Clonmel & Annermills
[underline]in[/underline]. It was trying to me to be seperated from ST, the
little bit I was, & very pleasant to me to join her again,
tho' in an arduous travel, not to say travail: we both have
much satisfaction in hearing of your present situation being
so comfortable. I had an oppertunity before leaving Bristol
of sharing thine with our dear friend Mary Dudley,
whose state of health I fear is not materially mending,
tho' if outward situation (in every respect) could tend thereto,
I think we should have a good chance of keeping this dear
friend a while longer, in this tribulated state. [underline]We[/underline] are now
bending towards Exeter, perhaps may be there in about two
weeks hence. Sarah is very diligent in her +[underline]calling[/underline], frequently
by visits families, & has those tremenduous publick meetings,
one of which is to be this afternoon, & if able [underline]after that,[/underline]
I hope to add a little. The meering over, - I am unqualified
to judge about it:– there was much said,– four testimonies beside
Sarah's two. – I seemed unable to get to stillness, or settlement
Sarah's two.–I seemed unable to get to stillness, or settlement
in myself,– was much perplexed in seeing people, who
I supposed were invited to meeting, standing at, & outside,
the door, while the seat [underline]we[/underline] sat on, as well as one or two
at front of the meeting were not near fill'd. Thus does
my
+it will apply two ways.

my poor mind to be sometimes occupied, I suppose for want of
getting deep enough in my spirit. These publick meetings are
particularly trying to me, I seem unable to have faith that
they answer much purpose, - the people as outward as they can
be, all for preaching, of which they get an abundance. I
often think were I once at home I believe I should stay
there, & yet when in any bettermost moods I cannot believe
I am where I ought [underline]not[/underline] to be: S:T is a good example,
where I follow it or not I shall often think of her,
a humble dedicated servant. So your sweet Saml. has
left school, a reduced school it is now I hear, – yet I hope
[underline]this[/underline] is no proof of things being wrong [underline]there[/underline].– Our deep
brother Abram favours me now & then with a [unclear]page ripped[/unclear]
letter, parts of them consoling, strengthening, & [unclear]page ripped[/unclear]
humbling to my mind,– other parts I make allowance f[or]
[underline]knowing[/underline] the animated writer, & also being convinced in my
own mind that the bottom [underline] in him [/underline] is sound & upright.
In the feeling of usual love thee-ward, I bid thee, for
the present, most affectionately farewell.
