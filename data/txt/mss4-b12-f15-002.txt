My dear Eliza [HENRY]
If I had been able to follow out the
impulses of my feelings, I should not
have been even thus long without
writing to express my affectionate
sympathy with you in this event of
your dear Mother's death. -
I say nothing of sorrow, for there can
be none in the contemplation of the
peaceful passing away of one so full
of years, or the closing for ever of the
earthly casket when the gem is once
contained had been dimmed by time,
at least as far as it has appeared to
those around her, but none of us can
tell how continued and consoling may
have been the intercourse between that
clouded spirit and its maker - how
perfect may have been the communion
though hidden from mortal eyes. - so
I speak not of sorrow, but there is a
solemn tender regret that you shall

[deletion][/deletion] behold the gracious loving
countenance of your Mother no
more: - that fond tie, so different
from every other bond, and for
you so long preserved, is at length
broken! - My mind and heart
have been very full of you, and I
have reflected much on her career
and the example she has afforded.
Respected, honoured and beloved, how
enviable has been her journey through
life, and singularly crowned with
blessings - blessings her consistent
conduct well earned - unpretending
in her quiet sway she ruled with
judicious care her domestic kingdom
and brought up her large family of
sons and daughters to do credit to
their name, and to see that name
holding its own to another generation -
ah: it is a great blessing! Well might
she lay down her aged head and
feel her day's work was well done!
How lonesome Glendruid will be without
how it will not be a [underline]right Glendruid[/underline]
without her presence - she who for
so long a period has been the
centre of a large family circle
their rallying point to gather
round - you will long miss the
Parent stem round which you
clustered - the object of anxious care
and devoted interest. - Poor Manliffe
will miss her sorely. - the
dutiful affectionate good son. - I
hope he is recovering, and that
all anxiety about him is over.
Oh! my ever dear Eliza, how vividly
I recal the happy days of our youth,
when first I was a guest at the lovely
Glen, when you and I revelled in
our romantic dreams, and wandered
through its shades, or sat in Tillietudlem
often quite silent in our delight, gazing
on the sea and mountains, - How
hospitable and how kind [deletion]was[/deletion][insertion]were[/insertion] your
mother and dear pleasant father!
Days of my youth where are ye! Friends
of my youth where are ye!
I would have written before to you, for
I am thinking so much and so affectionately
of you, my long loved friend, but on
my return home I found much to

engage me. - my dear [unclear]Miss d'Estone[/unclear]
became so ill the evening of my
coming home, that her Doctor had
to be called in, and she has been
confined to her bed ever since.
This, beside the needful attendance
on a sick bed entails much writing
for her to be done, and so I was
unable to compass time to write
to you. - and as it is you may see
both hurriedly and badly I have
at length accomplished the expression
of my feelings. -
It is sweet to think the Aged Mistress
will be laid in the place she had
so long adorned and loved. -
I hope Thomas Henry is quite well
with kindest regards to him, I say
farewell my dear Eliza - I would
have gone to see the family once
more collected around their Mother,
if it had been possibly in my
power. - Give them all my most
friendly sympathy and regards.
I am as ever, and for ever
your very affte
L. I. Fisher
