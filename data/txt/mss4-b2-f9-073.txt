Ballitore: 3/7 month 1785.

My dear Cousin,

	As there is a packet going to Stramore, I was willing to throw in my mile, though not conveniently circumstanced for writing much, as I am intending to set off presently for Newtown-meeting -- in compliance with a settled rule that little meetings should be frequently visited, I expected several friends from other meetings will meet there to day -- I returned home ^from my English expedition^ with Sally 20th ultimate -- we were favoured to get well along -- & I hope the journey was profitable to both of us -- Providence was kind & gracious in his protection of us, & in making our journeying & our sojourning prosperous -- I could not but mark the peculiarity of it in several instances -- I hope with humble gratitude -- James Abell was our kind & helpful, & edifying associate -- It was near 14 days from the time of our coming to, to the time of our finally leaving Coalbrook-dale. In that interval James Abell & I took a trip with Esther Tuke & her companion from Richard Reynoldss for Leek, where the Quarterly Meeting was held for Staffordshire & Cheshire -- Thomas Cash (dear for him) was there -- It was a satisfactory meeting -- On leaving the Dale, Cousin Debby Darby would needs accompany us to Shrewsbury -- her company was very acceptable -- she wished us to stay next day their week-day meeting at Shrewsbury -- we were almost consenting -- but in the morning something of condescending Goodness seemed to come over us as we sate together, & having had agreeable communications therein, therein we thought best to part -- so took leave without staying the publick meeting -- & just got in time the evening of the following day to reach the packet, which was going under sail -- having succeeded so well in getting on board, we were in great hopes that [margin] 4/7 month we should get to Dublin the next day 18th -- but the wind fell away, & our spirits & it flattened together -- Some nobility & gentry on board had pre-engaged the cabin & best beds -- we got a tolerable bed for Sally, James lay among the sailors, & poor I stretched myself upon the floor -- the night indeed was short, if night at all -- however my bones ached so, that the succeeding night I examined a second time the place of James Abells lodging (from which on the first inspection & scent, my nature recoiled), & put up with the best accommodation I could meet with there -- It was tedious to be so long at sea coming from Holyhead -- but certain circumstances contributed to make it more tolerable -- the sea was calm, unruffled like a large river -- the sun set with great lustre -- the moon rose with great brightness -- we were not sick -- the porpoises gamboled about the ship, as if to divert us with their play -- the fish offered themselves in shoals, & we caught them exceedingly fast, & eat heartily of them -- mostly Gurnets I think they called them -- But what crowned all -- the wind sprung up the last night in our favour, & we landed, got our luggage cleared, & arrived at Joseph Pikes just in time to breakfast & be at meeting 19th -- Samuel Emlen, George Dillwyn & Rebecca Jones were at it -- & a baptizing meeting it proved -- as well also the afternoon-meeting -- The next morning (20th) we took chaise, & all three arrived safe & well here, found my wife & Molly at tea in the evening, & all to appearance well -- which is cause of additional gratitude. Indeed numberless are the favours which I am daily partaking of -- And the desire of my heart is, that I may be enabled to walk wisely, & in some degree worthily, bringing honour to him & to his Cause, who has done so very much for me.
After writing the first page I went to Newtown, intending to finish & send at my return -- but our meeting of conference there continued so long, that I was late for the post-bag, & had but just time to get to our afternoon-meeting -- I think such visits & conferences have their use, & perhaps are as serviceable as a great deal of some sort of preaching -- There are many raw people among us, who want to be informed & instructed -- many points of discipline which ought to be explained & inforced [sic] -- and where true charity (gospel-love) is the covering of the spirit, under this covering & qualification things of a very close & delicate nature may be spoken to without fear of giving offence -- when the feet are shod with this preparation, we may tread on briers & thorns, without being hurt. I want thee, my dear cousin, & my dear friend our brother James, to look a little at this matter, & I trust ye do look at it, & that ye make a sacrifice of personal pique & ill treatment to yourselves, & like your great Master are willing to become as underlings & servants to all -- The genuine spirit of Christianity seeketh not its own (what it is justly entitled to by way of concession & acknowledgement & atonement), but forgives, & earnestly seeks & desires the welfare not only of friends, but enemies -- tis disinterested, not only as to worldly advantage, but as to the honour & reputation of Self -- Ye see that the good hand is at work up & down, laid in judgment & in mercy upon many here & there, drawing, fashioning, preparing & raising up to service -- ye are now advanced in years yourselves, & approaching the decline of life -- let not the cry be perpetually, I am not fit, I am not fit -- it is time it should be altered to that of, Here am I, send me -- Bend your attention towards those young plants that are in your vineyard there -- seek opportunities of nursing & watering them -- All is not to ^be^ left to preachers & preaching -- there is a wide & fruitful field for other labourers -- May you, my dear friends, willingly enter on, or rather continue with increase of diligence in your respective labours -- that so the blessing of preservation may surround you & yours, the most noble & important Cause that ever existed may prosper in your hands, & when the few, fleeting uncertain days that yet remain shall terminate, ye may be everlastingly & gloriously happy.
	We are, through kindness of Providence, favoured with usual health -- my wife seldom without cause of complaint of bodily infirmity -- but gets out & about as usual -- Aby very busy with his large school -- grows both in root & branch I hope in the divine soil -- bids fair for reflecting lustre on his name -- Lydia within few weeks of her expected increase -- their children at present finely -- Tommy Chandlee called here lately, & brought that they were tolerably well there -- Little Jane has had some pock, & was fretful -- I hear now & then from Peggy Grubb -- by last accounts she was comfortable & agreeable -- her mother-in-law & Becky continue in the same house with her, but diet themselves, & have separate apartments to themselves. Invitations & mutual civilities pass between & among them -- & all seems smooth -- My Grandson Abraham goes to Tom Chaylors school, has wrote out two copy-books, goes with his school-fellows to bathe -- & his father (I understand) thinks my said Grandson will be able to swim himself this summer -- I get a swim myself every morning -- ^Molly & Sally dip at times,^ & the children are dipped at Abys -- So we deal greatly in Ablution -- we are distressed about poor dear Anna Taverner -- She seemed better, & took an airing several times in our chaise -- but is fallen bad again -- it were like endless to be describing her complaints & indeed her complaints seems without end -- we pity her greatly, & feel equal compassion & affliction for her. How is dear James Morton? -- My dear love to him, with my wifes, when thou hast opportunity -- also to his Grandsons & Jemmy Clibborn -- to thy father & William (Molly hears from our dear Peggy from Limerick), to James if at home, & if he will stand still to receive it -- to our dear friends & relations at Lurgan Remember us to Molly MccLoughlin -- her counter-part Nanny MccConaughty is going down the hill -- but taken good care of by her mistress & children -- Betty Haughton is much on the decline -- Farewell, my dear cousin -- & tell thy sister Abby that though last mentioned she is not least in our affectionate remembrance. Farewell.
	Richard Shackleton

P. S. I met with our dear friends H. Bevington & S: Stephenson at the dale, going to Worcester -- Hannah poorly -- had been very sick at sea -- Sally finely -- they seemed not to regret their having left Ireland, but to hope it was in the right time.
