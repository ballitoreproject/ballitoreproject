10th.. month
Ballytore where we drove in
the covered car. After meeting
we went to see Mary Davis,
and also saw, I & E Barrington,
Anne & Alexander, and Mary
Gough who is spending some
time there. At Mr Davis"
we saw - Marianne Wakefield
and her daughter Jane I
also saw some of the Shackletons
however we were longing
to return to Dunlavin, as
we wanted to see Boherbue[deletion]y[/deletion]
before dinner, so accordingly
we drove up there and indeed
it looked very nice altho' they
had moved a good part
of the furniture down: as
they have left it for the Winter,
The drawing room is [unclear]very[/unclear]
