with Avy - called at Glendruid, found
all well there. Uncle Arthur came with
us on the car for part of the way
It was a lovely day, [unclear]but[/unclear] cold enough
a cold East wind blowing.
Just going to dinner who should come
but Charlie, a very welcome visitor.
Heard to day from Sally White that Mary
Elizabeth Webb was a little better.
I believe Uncle T and Aunt E intend
going to the North on next thursday.
While I write Philip, Charlie, Avy, and
Liddy, are in the room all reading
except Charlie who reclines at length on
the sofa. It is near eleven -
5th.. Rode with Charlie as far as
Glendruid and returned alone -
Drove down to Bray and got [underline]three[/underline]
letters -
6th.. We drove down to Bray again this
morning. I had a letter from Willie,
he said he had settled himself
down in a two storey house, the top story
