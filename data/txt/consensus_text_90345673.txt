just the same set. At first it was
stupid enough, but after a while [deletion]it[/deletion]
games were set on fast and between
them- some singing, and looking at
pictures we managed to pass the evening
pretty tolerably.-
6 Saturday My last morning at [unclear]Moosa[/unclear]
6 Saturday My last morning at [unclear]Moon[/unclear]
It was very fine and Isabel and I
spent most of it together - she and Aunt E
gave me ever so many plants - As
Bessie was arriving that morning the
phaeton which brought us to Athy
just met her - she arrived about ½ an hour
before we started so we had some time
for exchanging salutations and chatting
poor Bessie! she was very tired having
come all the way from London [unclear]the[/unclear] day
previous with three little Woosemans to
mind too, which was no joke - so we
parted at Athy . and [deletion][/deletion][insertion]off[/insertion] we sped
on our rapid way - I say we
because I had an escort and a very
entertaining one too, in Richard -
Charlie met us at the terminus
and I came directly on out here by
6½ train according to orders -
[unclear]So ends a[/unclear] pleasant visit to M[unclear][/unclear]
