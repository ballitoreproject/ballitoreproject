Though I have written last, yet, my dear Ben, I can [deletion]both[/deletion] excuse thy
silence at this juncture, & I am too much interested in thy concerns to keep
silent myself - Perhaps I did not know how much interested, I was, till I heard
that it was probable that a very important change was about to take place in
thy state of life. I know not the object of thy affections, but when I was last in Dublin
I was particularly struck with a young creature whose name, on enquiry, I found
to be Bell. I well remember that her form was elegant, & her countenance mild &
attractive. I think also her features were very pretty - Upon the whole I wish this
fair Damsel may be she “who holds thy heart in thrall,” & if so, that in due
time she may compassionate thy sufferings: for I expect the beautiful exterior
alone would not have won thee, & that it is inhabited by a mind who can
discern & reward merit, & as for thee, my dear fellow, if I could be security for
any one making a good husband I would for thee, & my heart & eyes at this
moment overflow, while I wish, & see in prospect for thee a scene of domestick happiness.
I know that clouds overshadow the fairest prospect, &, as Samuel Fothergill
says, Disappointment is another name for our enjoyments; yet I believe that
a cheerful receiver of the good things of this life is often a thankful one.
“Ten thousand, thousand precious gifts
My daily thanks employ,
Nor is the least a cheerful heart
That tastes these gifts with joy.”
I know, (& would that my conduct was more influenced by that knowledge!)
that nothing preserves us in the line of rectitude, & enables us to discharge
aright the various duties of life, but a humble reliance on Him who tempers
the tide of Prosperity, & supports when the waves of Adversity assail us. We may
carry ourselves fair in the eyes of our friends, but if we feel ourselves laying
the reins on the neck of our wills, we have not the comfortable feeling which
gives life its value, & there is a certain fearful looking for what may follow.
But thou art not unmindful of this, & I hope that resignation to what may
be allotted will be granted to thee, for it is by patiently resigning, that we
know better the value of enjoyment. I [deletion]hope[/deletion] [insertion]wish[/insertion], however, sincerely [deletion]hope[/deletion] [insertion]wish[/insertion], that it

will not be required of thee to resign so sweet a hope [insertion]as that wch thou now aspires to[/insertion]. Now I think thou art
possessed of the four qualifications which constitute the good husband. Namely
Good Nature, Good Sense, Good Temper & Good Breeding.
I place Good Nature foremost, because I think it the greatest blessing & ornament
of our Nature. The possessor of it may not excel in what [deletion]is[/deletion] [insertion]are[/insertion] looked upon as the
higher endowments of the mind, his understanding may not exceed mediocrity,
his temper may not flow in an even current, & Education may not have refined
his manners. But that respect which he pays to the feelings of others will
teach him rectitude of conduct towards them, which the Man of sense, unassisted
by Good Nature, will often prove deficient in; it will correct & atone for the
starts of temper which make him more unhappy than those on whom they
are vented, & his hearty goodwill causes such a readiness to oblige & accommodate,
that the most polished manners cannot do more. Wanting this kindness of
disposition, a man of sense, temper & politeness will yet seem to possess it,
but the uniformity cannot be supported without a perpetual struggle [insertion]for[/insertion] he will
not feel that pleasure in the welfare of others which he wishes (& sometimes
wishes in vain) to shew, but which the good natured man cannot succeed in
concealing, if he wished to conceal it . Does not Sir Hugh Tyrold recur to thy remembrance?
But we need not fiction. My dear, early friend Wentworth [unclear]Mansurgh[/unclear]
might sit for the portrait of the Goodnatured Man. He was eminent
in nothing else, but this seemed quite enough, & who ever saw his unbounded
drollery checked by a tale of sorrow, his countenance change in a moment, his
struggles to suppress his tears, & his anxiety to relieve, [deletion]but loved[/deletion] if relief was to
be obtained, however saw him thus, & did not love him ever after? But
his course [deletion]has[/deletion] is run - In the jollity of an hunting party, galloping in the
chase, his bridle broke, he fell, & spoke no more. My Sister Lydia said of him,
He led a cheerful life & she believed an innocent one:
If to Good Nature be added Goodsense, the man [deletion]will[/deletion] [insertion]may[/insertion] not be more beloved, but he
will be more respectable, & capable of extending wider [deletion]the[/deletion] his influence, &
consequently of extending his own happiness & the happiness of others. He
will not so readily become the dupe of those who want to entrap the
guiltless & unsuspecting - He will be able to assert the dignity of his Nature,
which Goodnature simply finds it difficult to protect, & he will not be so deeply

wounded by the arrows of ingratitude or ridicule, which Good Nature receives
with a surprize which doubles the pain, as they are weapons he is unacquainted
with. Goodsense extracts the darts, & pours in the balm of conscious merit, or wards
them with the shield of discernment. Willing to make allowance for the faults
of others & to repair his own, the man of Good Nature & Good Sense, will [insertion]endeavour to[/insertion] keep
his Temper, however inclined to violence, in subjection, he can do so, & he will
know the proper respect to be paid to others, if he never has mixed with polite
society.
But how much happier will that Man be, who is not under the painful
necessity of warring with an impetous temper, which too often will break
down the barriers established by Good Nature & Good Sense, who will find
it difficult afterwards, perhaps impossible, to repair the injuries which have
been committed, or to heal the wounds which have been inflicted [deletion]perhaps[/deletion] in
the bosom of a dear friend. For though we have the ability granted us to keep
in subjection an unruly temper, yet how often will the weakness of human
nature prevail, & deep repentance be scarcely able to reconcile the mind of sensibility
to itself.
He who possesses Good Nature, Good Sense & Good Temper, will not be
deemed to want any farther accomplishment, yet that ease & elegance which
he imperceptibly acquires by associating with those whose minds & manners
are cultivated, as well as by attention to the cultivation of his own, gives
a delightful finishing to the excellent picture, & by universal consent forms
[underline]The accomplished Man[/underline]. Now should this man become a Husband, (& it
would be a thousand pities he should not,) how happy must his Wife be!!!
Dear Ben, Art thou tired of my sententious, or sentimental, or What-
d'ye-call-it letter? If so, take courage, for the land appears. Betty Wilson
is here, & has been very poorly, but we would not like her Mother should know
that, as I hope she will be better on the whole for her excursion. But I have
been very thoughtful about her, & behold with concern that her frame is
more & more relaxed, & I am of the fixed opinion that sea-bathing would be of
essential service. I believe her Mother would strain a point to let her have that
advantage, but I know that the excuse of expense would be an object with
Betty. Were I near her her uncle Thomas I would hazard throwing it before him, tho' I
know not whether it would be agreeable to him or them I should do so. But

I love my pretty, little Bess, & want to have her life prolonged & made comfortable
for she deserves it. Thos. Boake & his fair Bride move about the Village, &
make a comely shew. I have presented an Epithalamium, which has been graciously
accepted, save that it was reckoned rather short, I mean in length, I hope not
deficient in compliment for what was of it. But I should not tell [underline]thee[/underline] this - for thou
will be putting in for me - but don't expect it - I give thee fair warning - for I have
exhausted all my sayings on that occasion. Margery McMeehan, alias Hudson,
with her sensible, sober, unaffected husband & two fine children are here. Her husband
went to Baltinglass yesterday, rather dull from the impression of a dream,
dined with Ephraim Park & while they sat enjoying a little convivial festivity
one of his (Ephraim's children) came crying in to tell that her sister was drowned;
they had been playing at the river edge, the child, about 8 years old, stooped
over a deep hole to gather flowers, her footing gave way, & she fell in. Some Soldiers,
who were bathing near her, got her out, & thought she breathed once, but
all means to restore life were vain; & James McMeehan, a fond father himself,
witnessed the distraction of the Parents, strove to comfort them, & saddened the
Village at his return with the tale of sorrow. Thou will not wonder that Wm.
& I were deeply impressed with it. My dear friend, may thou never be enabled
by thy own feelings to understand such distress!
Our dear Sally Shackleton is away from us, far away, & like to remain
the summer, though I dreamed last night that she came home, & was not well,
she is subject to a pain in the stomach, which causes me some uneasiness on
her account. Betsy Barrington will hand thee this. She is a living & a lively
Epistle, therefore put me in thy pocket, till a more convenient season - but do not
forget, at that season, to take me out, & also to send a [underline]few lines[/underline] - for I cannot
expect [underline]many[/underline] now, however desirous of many, to thy faithful friend
Mary Leadbeater
Ballitore: 16th of 7th month 1804.
We are anxious for good news of Jane Fowler. I hope John Haughton is
finely again. Please ask Jos Manders if John Lambard delivered Sir Chas. Corte
a letter I sent by him.
