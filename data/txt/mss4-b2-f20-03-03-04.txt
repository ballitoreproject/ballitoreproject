From the same to the same

Ballitore: 18th of 6th month 1760

Dear friend,

	I received thy favour of 15th instant: with a mixture of pleasure & pain, I was pleased to hear from an old friend of whom I have often thought & spoken with sentiments of regard. But the stile of thy letter not being written as by one of our religious Society gave me a shock attended with a sorrowful pain.
	I confess, dear--, from my earliest years youth my heart has been attached to the welfare of our little community, because I found even in my childhood, a more certain demonstration of the truth of the principles which we profess, than all the councils & synods of the most learned men can produce by mere human reason, of the several systems & opinions, which they have invented & established in their own wills & power. And this most sure Word of revealed to me in my childhood, & since in the same manner repeatedly confirmed has caused that I could not but in heart wish well to the doctrine, though I too often (through temptations of youth, &c) deviated from the practice. There are many arts and improvements by which wise & ingenious persons may deserve well of mankind; but certainly there is no cause more noble in itself, & interesting in its nature than that of true religion. We should therefore take especial care that whatever notions & practices we are building up in our religious capacities, they be laid on the only right foundation, which may be abundantly proved from [page number 325] sacred Writ, to be the immediate revelation of Christ Jesus, the Author & Finisher of the true Faith. And if he be the Author & Finisher of it, what right has mans will or wisdom to meddle in it. Bow, dear friend, to his appearance in thee, & despise it not, though it seem ever so mean. Do not sell thy birth right of being a member of a Society which has been raised, preserved & highly favoured by Almighty Power, for a name & fame among men. +++

thy affectionate friend
Richard Shackleton
