Foston 1st month 15th 1784

My dear beloved Uncle
	When I sent thee a few lines upon a frank some months ago it was far from my intention or expectation to be thus long silent to thee ^one^ with whom conversation by word or pen is peculiarly gratifying to my natural & best feelings  I had at that time but very little doubt of mothers coming in a few days to stay a while at Foston but some unforeseen circumstance prevented & when as I found that mother had wrote ^thee^ it satisfied me, believing it would not be a confined illiberal communication but large & noble like herself  soon after that a chain of business opened out in which deep & arduous has been the exercise of my mind in various accounts  my mother would tell thee I make no doubt of a visit being set on foot to the monthly meetings of ministers & Elders & their families in this County a work in which deep wading of spirit must be the experience of such as are concerned herein  [illegible] monthly meeting became an object soon after mothers last letter to thee & it was entered upon by eight Friends of the Comittee [sic] in greata humiliation & fear & the families lying wide we divided into 2 companies four in each  it took us near a week, brought us individually often to try our own foundations & united the visitors in close spiritual fellowship  But how can I describe to ^thee^ the natural feelings of my mind when sitting down as a visitor with the aged, the honourable, the anointed servant in the house but who, as Saul, as Eli or as Sampson &c &c have incurred divine displeasure  my childishness in every respect, my danger & my proved weakness stare me in the face & dare me so much as to be baptized for these spiritually dead Lions in the Camp, of which we have aa sorrowful number in this County, nor do I ever find a renewed preparation for this work but by experiencing first the sentence of death in myself that I should not trust in myself but in Christ who died for us, the resurrection of whose life leads captivity captive & bestows his gifts in diversity upon us, even to such as have heretofore rebelled, then is the Apostles experience understood that though he was [?]ified yet nevertheless he lived & not he but Christ that lived in him, under whose government we cannot of ourselves touch the 
Lords anointed or do his Prophets any harm  From this visit we went immediately to our Quarterly Meeting at Leeds which was very large & owned with divine favour ^no strangers but on [sic]^  after this many Friends staid about Leeds Bradford & Sheffield the ensuing week & [word crossed out] ^met^ at Ackworth the 4th of this month at the Committee, where three men were appointed to join such women of the standing appointment as were present, in a religious visit to the different classes & departments in that large & favored family, where Satan & his agents often assemble with their enmity to the pure seed, but to supplant his Kingdom was our capital aim, for its hard indeed if a House is opened & dedicated to the truth of an Enemy lays siege to it takes ^it^ & presides over not only the willing but ^the^ unwilling captives who can but, when seeing this danger, contend for their faith. Our company consisted of Thomas Priestman, John Hoyland, my Husband, Mother, ^& further^ Molly Proud, M Routh J. Preistman, E. Hoyland & myself  we often divided in our visits & still it was to us near aa weeks close exercise  Mother desired I would tell thee that Thomas Binns is she thinks since his coming to Ackworth much improved in the root of religion  he has ^had & still has^ some hard things ^to^ grapple with, some chastisements which promise a crop of the peaceable fruits of righteousness  I often remembered when at Ackworth some of thy observations about that place & especially respecting those that go, not leaving the word [?] to serve tables  it opportunely instructed me & strengthened my mind sometimes to keep silence when domestic subjects seemed as temptations therefrom  this I mention to let thee see that thou dost not always labour in vain & to encourage thee to administer thy wholesome counsel in future  Having now cleared my way a little by offering some pretty substantial apologies for not fulfilling my engagement (which I hope will obtain thy excuse) it now behoves me gratefully to acknowledge the receipt of they two last letters both which I have ^afresh^ [word struck through] reperused with much satisfaction  Have you yet performed or finished your visit to the Provinces the Princes thereof?  thy account of the family visit with M.R. &c or rather the observations thereon were particularly acceptable & instructive to my mind as also respecting J. Tomey, his death somewhat affected me though I never knew or saw the man, but these pillars of salt ought savourly to impress our minds & teach us still more carefully to lay up our treasure in Heaven  had Lots wife been thus concerned she could have had no inducement to look back to Sodom, & oh th indeed there is when we feel some ^a^ secret divine approbation for some little faithful services as the answer of well done, carefully to center this treasure & leave it in the Hands of our great Benefactor, for how unfit are our earthly ^hearts^ to be entrusted with 
riches so weighty & different in their nature, they are indeed found to be as bags with holes which lose the precious gift among the rubbish of the house  under these considerations, I am led at times to prefer poverty, nakedness & want to an appearance of wealth & spending my spiritual substance in riotous living, & to be preserved chaste & faithful ^in this state^ is one of my strongest desires, yet attended in some degree with the certain ^knowledge^ of how weak I am 
I am pleased to hear that Cousin Debbys loss last winter is made up this & that she was so bravely  please give our dear love to them at Athy [?]  I rejoice that my dear Sister Peggy has got over in her family the distressing & alarming disorder of the smallpox  this singular ^blessing^ will to a mind so sensible as hers quallify some dregs in her cup of life  I want to write to her but such a variety ^of occurrences^ as have fallen to my lot of late could she know them would I believe excuse me in her mind. We had a letter from Brother John the other day wherein he tells us that thou had joined them on a family visit at Clonmel & that M. Dudley has agin shewed herself in the congregation & still I am a little puzzled & more at a loss to account for things than some people are  thou art a wise man, a Father in the Church & canst tell me if thou wilt  As to Doctor Jonathan I fear he will be a thorn in the sides if not in the eyes of his Parents. What dost thou think of M. Stokes, is she likely to stand upon the Pillar of Truth or ^on^ some other pretty pedistal hard bye that which not being cut out of the mountain without hands is perishable in its nature & will not support her in the baptisms of water & fire?  I fear with thee that Jemmy Daniel has not yet entered the strait gate into a perfect unity with the life of religion & those that dwell in it tho perhaps the external inclosure might be profitable to him  I felt much on his account when at Clonmel & though I was in an opportunity or two with him my mind being below its proper center concealed what rested thereon & to remove this burden I committed it to paper which likewise centered with my self  standing thus towards him thou wilt not wonder if I feel a little interested in his welfare  We have had an account this ^week[?]^ (tho not enough confirmed to depend on) that J. Pemberton from some unforeseen event ^in American is^ in called home  Brother John mentions William Matthews ^leaving^ there but says nothing of John which we wonder at  Our very dear love is to them or to the one if the other is gone  as we are but just returned after a four weeks absence from home I cannot give thee much account of our [word struck through] beloved Friends D & E Priestman  they sent a messenger yesterday to desire us to go over to Malton but as there ^was^ nothing more in it than a visit to themselves we thought they should wait till we had paid thee & our Friends at Clonmel one
If they knew of my writing they would desire to be remembered by thee for I know their affectionate to [sic] & esteem for thee  Betty has I think been more faithful since thou wast here they message to her perhaps might contribute to effect this necessary end  She has a beautiful gift, clear, intelligent & sound  David deepens in the root & is frutifull in the branches they are friends to whom we are bound I trust in the covenant of life  We are expecting my sister Betty to stay a while with us  she is in a very poor state of health, has many alarming consumptive symptoms most of which are brought on I believe through close & deep exercise of mind  her present indisposition is affecting to us all because her life seems particularly desirable being a lovely ^plant^ of righteousness  She continues to appear & grows in her gift ^&^ through ^all^ that is past a hope attends my mind that the great Lord of the Harvest will spare to us in this day of deep declension such as are qualifying to be Labourers in his work; but the future & perhaps the ensuing spring will prove it  Our own little family though small (& likely to continue so) often affects [word struck through] ^our^ minds with careful solicitude & shews us the need of having wisdom to know how to go in & our before them  John Moon a valuable young man who came into the society by convincement & has lived with us since we came to housekeeping is I think growing in the truth, but it seems time for him to enter into business for himself of some kind or other, he has been singularly led in many respects & as prudent & diffident as was becoming his growth in religion &c, a man of good understanding & dicernment [sic] in things natural and spiritual; but how, in what business & what place to settle this man, or advise him, is the present important consideration on account of his preservation in the Truth, seeing how multitudes fall into one snare or other respecting Temporal things & the Church deprived thereby of Pillars faithful & true  He has a competent knowledge of husbandry & flour mills

Sally Lee our valuable maid servant is still with us & likely to continue  She was for some months after thou wast here without opening her mouth in meetings & though remarkably steady in her conduct & countenance I was sensible she labored under deep exercise, through all which I avoided entering into this subject with her or seeing to know any thing about it, not only from a knowledge that this treatment would be most agreeable to myself in a similar case but principally from a fear of touching the work when upon the wheel & lest by repeating any little experience of my own I might cast a dead flie into the divine anointing & so render it offensive to the Master & his Servant, for there seems to me so great a purity in that milk of the word which is communicated to the Babes in Christ that without great care it may easily be defiled  & in this circumstance we are renewedly convinced the He who graciously visits needs not instrumental means to carry forward his work in the sincere devoted minds of his children, for this poor afflicted girl after being tried with kneeling down in our monthly meeting losing her matter & uttering not one word, the Friends being on their feet, has several times of late expressed a few sentences in meetings with simplicity of life & her mind appears to enjoy a quiet serenity  I have given thee a little account of these things because I have found thee & Aunt Shackleton interested in what materially concerns us & therefore doubt not thy excusing it  Sisters [sic] Sally Tuke threatens to enlarge their family in a few weeks  She is finely in health & her spirits amiably serene  Marias little Esther is a lovely child  Brother Henry & Sister are finely I trust every way  Brother William & Sister Nancy at Home, Mable at Ackworth all well, as were Father & Mother to day having just received a few ^lines^ from the latter  My very dear love attend Aunt & thyself in which my Husband unites thy affectionate & obliged niece S. Grubb
