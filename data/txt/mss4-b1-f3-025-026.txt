			A. S. to Margaret S.
	My very dear Grand-daughter,
		Thy welcome and acceptable letter was received. There are two worthy living ministers of the gospel of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, arrived in this city from my native-country; they exhort us to abide in the littleness. My very soul, and every thing within me that is worth notice, says amen to it. I think I have been stripped to the very root since I came to town; but, thanks to Him who, though he hides his face for a moment, will never totally forget his little flock: he appears in the needful time, and his hand is filled with consolation. Let him be thy chiefest joy, my dear, and then thou wilt step wisely in thy pilgrimage; little minding what people think of thee, if thou hast but the smiles of his countenance

P. 81.	My health is much better this morning; and if i should not live to see thee, and the rest of you there, who are near and dear to me, I trust, through mercy, to be gathered to the generations of those gone before, whose robes are happily washed in the blood of the Lamb.
	I am, with endeared affection to thy aunt, brother, sisters, and my friends there, thine
	Dublin, 30th of Fourthmonth, 1769.		A. S.
