so fine went out, thinking we
should have a walk towards the
park & homes by the circular road
but alas! again[deletion]e[/deletion]we were prevented
by the rain, for we had not
gone as far as the barracks when
large drops began to speckle the
path-way - and soon the whole
sky which had been so bright
was overcast with dark rainy
clouds, so - we turned our
steps homeward and having
called at Walsh's for Phils watch &
at Armstrongs to match a slipper
pattern we came home - Papa
came in at about 1 O'clock
I got a little note from him
from Polly - in which she
said that Charlie instead of
going straight to Fassaroe stopped
at Glendruid and rode over
in the evening, at [unclear]lease[/unclear] either
