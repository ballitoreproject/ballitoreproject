Kilduff 20 of 1 Mo: [underline]1817[/underline]
My Dear William
from the length of time since I heard from
you respecting the concession of the Widow Doyle
to my Father's proposal, I should be led to conjecture
her Delay proceeds from an intention perhaps to recover
her Demand by Law - This induces me to write to you
on the Subject and to trouble you again to inform her
that my Father is now in Dublin at 21 Meclingburgh.
St. where he would be glad to see some person from
her to settle as he proposed, Namely Â£14 a year witht
any cost, except of protest &c which I suppose she was
charged with herself. He remains there, I should
Suppose for ten days at least, so that if she would
[deletion]she would[/deletion] Send up the necessary instruments, with my
Bile, [underline]immediately[/underline], he is ready, he says, to sign it -
This you might do by a note to her, if it was not convenient
for you to go out there yourself; but I would rather
you could see her - whatever [insertion]way[/insertion] you do it, let there be no
delay, that there be no Disappointment from loss of time -
I wish it was settled, it would make my mind easy -
Please tell Joshua Abel that I would thank him to arrange
my account, and prepare all those Articles of mine,
Books &c for a Move, as I intend in the course of a few
days

days to send up a chest to carry them all here - what
is with you, namely the Desk, I mean not to stir yet
if it is not inconvenient to you, rather to my friend
Sally I should have said, for I Believe it lies in her room
How are you all getting on these strange times?
Happy for those, who, instead of ascribing these Revelations
of Divine Anger to chance on Natural causes, Search
their own hearts to discover the true cause of these calamities,
and confessing their iniquities to him from whom
they cannot be hid, and imploring pardon through his mercy
in christ Jesus, they may receive grace to serve another
Master, and to become the children of another parent,
and by walking worthy of the glorious calling may
avert that judgments from themselves and families-
Here [deletion]are[/deletion][insertion]is[/insertion] no people I Believe who, under the disorders of
human Nature, exposed to the View of an omniscient, pure
& holy God, rest so tranquil, under such apparent security,
as those of your Society, as if mere profession
was the wedding garment, and a name the passport
to the Marriage supper; for these excepted, the difference
is as Nothing - The advantages resulting to
Society from their rules of Discipline, and systematic educaton
of their youth, are great, we all must allow.
But why sleep under the Gentile's roof and rest securely
on a Heathen's Bed- If Social Benefits alone procure
Heavenly treasures then are you rich indeed; but if the
heart, the Soul, the Mind with [underline]all[/underline] their power and strength
are to be directed towards things above; if Worldly pursuits
are only to [insertion]be[/insertion] considered when the inheritance above is sealed
If I say, the Kingdom of God and his righteousness
is to be first and chiefly sought after, and to be thus minded
is a proof of our faith in Christ and our Adoption as Sons;
I am not blamable if I suspect your Body (communion) to
have

have many Bastards - Worldly prosperity taken in
a general Sense, is my friend, a presage of the Soul's adversity
Luke 6.24, 1 Tim.6,9,17 James 1.10 &c &c, and as I am indebted
to you in friendship, the last payment I can make is to
advise you and all others, while the Day is, to harden not your
hearts, to put no trust in uncertain riches, nor in outside appearances
but to seek the one thing needful, every where and in
every act to glorify God the giver of all Blessings, and to
lay up treasures in his kingdom, where neither Moth nor
rust can corrupt - To this case and these desires I commit
you and all friends - and I remain my Dr Wm
your affectionate friend
Peter North-
Love to Sally, Mary, friends at the Mill, School, and els[insertion]e[/insertion]where
