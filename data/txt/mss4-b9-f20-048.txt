My dear E
Tho' the letter was old it was
welcome, I think it best to mend
the Widow Lawler's house Edw is at the
Glen or I would ask him but I wd thank
thee to get it done as it may grow
worse, did Ellison take the house?
I wish Hannah much joy of her Lydia
I hope it may thrive, Magt was gone to
bed before her letter arrived I think she will
be very proud of it, Johnny has got quite
well & neither know [unclear]Weger[/unclear] have taken
the measles yet but I think they will I am
delighted to have Johnny [unclear]with[/unclear] & I hope if the [unclear]weather[/unclear]
continues mild that the others will get tho'
petty well also give my dear love to Deborah I have
not time to write I send the truss for her to thy
case by R Burton, I am sorry M Kelly wd not
leave [unclear]Can[/unclear] Duffy [underline]with[/underline] thou. She would have [unclear]answered[/unclear]
very well - her father will be disappointed as well as
herself - M Kelly wanted her herself

Harriet intended to follow her in a week & would
