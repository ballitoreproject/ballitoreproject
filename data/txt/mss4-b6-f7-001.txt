Carlow 4th of 10 Mo 1793
Dear cousin ML
Meeting with the present opportunity, & supposing
that you are anxious about me, I thought I would strive to
write a few lines, tho' very badly able, being very stiff & sore
almost all over, I apprehend the complaint is scorbutick &
therefore likely to be tedious, however the extreme violence of
the inflamation is I think somewhat abated in some parts, which
if it should continue will be a great favor, but I suppose it is
the nature of the complaint to grow better & worse, I have compared
my situation to that of Job, being first stripped of so many
of my near relatives, & then smote with this grievous sore, but
I fear am far behind him in point of patience, tho I strive
for it. I have been recommended dwarf elder tea, which is
scarce in this neighbourhood, but I suppose is plenty with you
therefore would be obliged to thee if thou would get a good quantity
of it gathered & if opportunity should serve at the Mo
meeting it may be sent, the children are getting on finely

this is the second day of it coming out, & they have but a very
few spots. give my very dear love to my honoured Aunt. also
to Abram's family, we would be glad to hear how Sam's son
is. conclude with dear love to William & thyself, thy affect.
