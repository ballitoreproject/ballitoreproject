My dear Sister
How do you like
Ballitore, Eliza said she thought
you might have written, the
Sunday after you went Thomas
Grub and some of the Allens
were here. Edward says that

they miss you very much, have
you taken many walks since
you went, and did you go out
to tea often. Eliza has got a
book for Tillietudlem that
any body may write in that
pleases, it has the picture of
Tillietudlem drawn in it by
Richard. Give my love to
Manliff, Sarah, and Eliza
Gough. I hope you will
write to me, and tell Manliff
to write to me soon.
I remain your affectionate
sister Emily B
PS Ask Sarah shall I [insertion]write to[/insertion] her

To
Lucy Barrington
Ballitore
