Clonmel 4 of 9 mo: 1792
My dear Mother,
I wrote to my Brother 6th day last, & thought
to have been indulged by him, or one of my sisters, with a more
particular relation of my very dear Father's close, if he
dropped any expressions that were collected, or was delirious,
whether [insertion]you[/insertion] were sure it was a fever that terminated his valuable
useful life; I have heard very little about this afflicting
event, which seems like a dream to me, & but for (I might
say) accident I should not known he was sick, till I heard
he was no more; how he has slipt away from us, & life as
greatly to bemoan our loss! I don't know any left in this
land to equal him for usefulness & Wisdom in spiritual
things: the fame good power that qualified & endowed him
is doubtless able to qualify other's also if their dwelling was so
near the divine Spring as his was, & equal humility, simplicity
& watchfulness kept to, Self being made of no reputation,
& every crown (but what Truth puts on) laid down, as
at the great Master's feet; the Divine life being alone
the crown of Glory. May this become more & more the
experience of his offspring I much desire, as for thee
my

my dear Mother thou hast I think abundant cause to
"Thank God & like courage", thou hast been his beloved faithful
wife, & true help-meet for many years, sit him at liberty
to fulful his duty, & I [deletion]believe[/deletion] trust is favoured to believe, that his
spirit has entered into the joy of his Lord, out of all sorrow,
perplexity, anxiety or trouble, if he was left by thee how
helpless would he be, & he is spared this trial, a little more
conflicts & we shall all follow, even the youngest of [underline]us[/underline],
as [insertion]for[/insertion] my part I never [deletion]that[/deletion] thought less of life than at present. & [insertion]to[/insertion] the
end of the journey seems so short, that this World diserves but
little of our contemplation, only to walk so in it, as to honour
the great Author of our Being, & receive the answer of [underline]Well done[/underline]
at last; & yet I am aware many may be the bitter cups I
may have to drink before it is finished. Our family are
at present in health, the young children thrive. our relations
are also generally well. John & Mary Hilton are at
Anner-mills, they are often ailing, & their little boy but
delicate, how is Nancy Gatchel now? poor Woman, she must
have felt deeply for her dear friend. I cannot hear how is
dear James Christy (of Lurgan) my sweet intelligent correspondant
is gone. he used to tell how all our acquaintances
were almost, I may read his past letters, but shall yet no
more

more from him: he often intireided on our behalf, & I
believe we were secretly benefited by it. may we now be
this more incited to diligence in interceding for ourselves, that
so the blessing that followed him may not be removed from
his house, but continue from one generation to another.
Our Anne has been in Waterford for some time past, we
intend to send Richard to Ballitore soon, he is obliged to thee
for thy kindness to him, & I hope he will continue to
deserve, & receive it: my dear Father was pleased with the
children when he was here, I hate thought it was to be the
last visit to us. If I had should not have lit him out my
sight when awake I believe, but how short sighted are
me; tho' whom I was in the country the losing him came
very close & home to me, having a kind of impression
that we should not have him very long, & when I was
writing a letter to him there, it was in tears.
My Husband joins in dear love to you. Inclosed is
a bill, which please to hand to Brother Abraham.
The ink is so thick
I can scarcely write
Since I finished this I received my dear Brother's acceptable letters
[deletion]with[/deletion] much comforted & afflicted me, I was glad to recive some account of
our dear Father, tho' my affliction was revived, & my feeling on his

own

account, finding he has been M, which I do not wonder at, the dear creature
being so suddenly deprived of such a head, he [underline]must[/underline] feel it, but I hope that hand
which has wounded will heal, & that a potion of our dear Father's [insertion]oparity[/insertion] choice [insertion]will[/insertion] rest
upon him, whereby he may be indued with Wisdom to judge Israel also. Excuse
my complaining of not getting a letter, but Sally was with him to the end, & could
write me particulars, how I love to think of him. I thought at times since, I felt
his spirit near; as if keeping me, even to its what I thought required of me.
