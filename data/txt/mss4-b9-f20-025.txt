My dear Elizth I recd thine yesterday & will attend to thy commission
about Fanny & also see further of Harriet perhaps
she may change her mind I would wonder if she did not
encline to Ballitore She was greatly attach'd to Betsy & I think
would give up something for her society Fanny promised
to call here very soon but she is so tedious that her very soon
may be a long time coming, Poor Edw Farmer! I had heard
of his death thro' Debby Johnson, it is well [insertion]he [/insertion] had no family to leave
behind him yet his lonely situation so far from his friends was
very deplorable, - Edw recd the papers sent by R Barton
he still says that it will be necessary to get all the
papers respecting that holding [insertion]in Earle Street[/insertion] that there may be a
renewal made out otherwise it may slip thro'
our fingers as the King is not in a good state [unclear][/unclear]
health now no matter if there were twice as [unclear][/unclear]
papers send them all up in a bag by the first opportunity
it will at least show that thou art willing to do whatever
Edw pleases, this is between ourselves, as he seem'd disappointed
at not getting the whole of the papers respecting
it, it seems very clear that the marriage settlement
leaves the whole to my mother's children but that is
not the present question it is necessary to get a
renewal without delay & this cannot be done without
the whole of the papers, excuse this preamble but I
am anxious that Edw may meet no obstruction as he
seems at present willing to [underline]work[/underline] & help all he can
I went to Cork for Harriet to day in hopes of having

some account to send thee but found I was too
late to go to Camden street & was obliged to turn back
[deletion]I write now[/deletion] I am grieved to hear of my poor nurse's trouble
Ally says that Tom was her only help, I would wish
her to get tea & sugar & meal & broth now & then
to nourish her according to thy judgement at my expence
do not be too sparing I would be very sorry she
should want anything of the kind, I do not think
Mary the best mesenger as she is herself very covetous
if Sally Fanel could be come [unclear]it[/unclear] she wd be better but
she is at service I think excuse this scrawl
ever thy SB
