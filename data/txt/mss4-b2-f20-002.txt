++ Though thou didst not seem to require an answer to thy letter, but only submittedst added in possibly editorially], it to my consideration, lest thou should[st added in possibly editorially], think me wanting in attention, or defective in good manners, I thought it best to make some reply to it. I do not pretend to be an adept in language though I have been a school-master, & along with my occupation, which I have quitted, I hope I have quitted all that dogmatical pedantry, & trifling pertinacity about words which have been attributed to that chair. I just speak my own sentiments--language is the vehicle of our thoughts, & this vehicle grows old, & out of repair, is subject to wear & tear like other things - one part of it decays, & is supplied by some new work, in process of time another part is broken or lost, further amendment is necessary, & so by degrees the whole vehicle consists of other materials than its original fabric. When vital Christianity was revived about the middle of the last century, in & among our ancestors, as instruments to carry on that glorious work in England, Thee & Thou was used by equals among themselves, & by superiors to inferiors: Ye & You was used by inferiors to a superior, & was in general the complimentary compellation. Our friends were called to [page number 319] bear their testimony, among other corruptions, against this mean duplicity & flattering respect of persons, as proceeding from the corruption of the human heart & vitiated manners; they testified against it, because it had its origin in moral evil-- the ungrammatical application of these pronouns was not the ground of their negative testimony, but a collateral argument which they adduced in favour of it & in addition to it--indeed I am very sorry to see this argument very much invalidated by ourselves; too many of us entirely exploding plain, honest, upright Thou and putting his younger brother Thee in his room--but I hope there is a growing reformation in this respect. As to ye & you, I am very sensible of the distinction which thou makest, & of the strict grammatical propriety of it, but though it might have been an illegal usurpation at first, yet you has so often got into the place of ye, held it so quietly & without opposition, that I am in general not offended at seeing the usurper there--nay, I think that he sometimes fills the seat with a better grace & firmness than his elder brother, but ye has no sort of right to intrude into the place of you-- he has sometimes intruded, but generally in jocularity or burlesque--this disquisition puts me in mind of a story I have heard--In some meeting of conference where there was a long debate whether Ye or You was the more proper term to be inserted in some writing that was drawing up, an old woman stood up, & put an end to the contention by saying that she believed the word Ye was [page number 320] the more proper, as the language of scripture was, O ye fools.
	As to holden & holpen, & such like harsh-sounding, uncouth, obsolete words, which have died a natural death, I would let them go to the grave without regret; we have plenty of words left to supply their place--indeed I think there may be a snare of the adversary (the prince of the power of the air) in this little, low, superficial dabbling about words--we may be too closely engaged in poring on the outside of the book-- & thereby be disqualified from looking & reading within. The book of revelation exceeds all other books of art & nature, may the seals of it, according to the economy of Divine Wisdom be gradually opened to us for our instruction as to our respective states & qualifications for service in the Church of Christ ++++
