My dear Mother
We returned yesterday from Cork
so I did not receive thy letter untill last night
I therefore could not [deletion]answer[/deletion] wr[insertion]i[/insertion]te in answer
untill today. Thou wert disappointed at not
hearing from [insertion]me[/insertion] before this but we staid a
day longer in Cork than we expected. I
 am looking out for a person returning to Dublin
and hope I may meet with an agreeable
one, as I think it is high time for
me. John More is in Limerick but I do
not know when he goes back, I will write
when I have fixed it to let you know
when to expect me. Ebenezer went yesterday
morning so going with him is out of
the question. he and RSL were here while
we were at the meeting. I am glad to
hear you are pretty well at home for I had a
letter from Sister Elizabeth and she mentioned
[underline]thy[/underline] having a cold which made me uneasy

also Manliffs being able to "[underline]get out to the[/underline]
[underline]men again[/underline]". I did [insertion]not[/insertion] hear any [insertion]thing[/insertion] was the matter
with him. The weather has been very
severe a good deal of snow had fallen but
I was very much pleased this morning on
looking out of the window to see no sign
of the white world we had yesterday.
I expect to see you all very soon and hope
you may be well and that I may not
regret my lengthened visit. I am enjoying
the thoughts of going home very much
and I think I would be ungrateful if
I did not feel sorry for leaving this where
I have met with such kindness. I was
very much pleased with my visit to Cork
The family where we lodged were very
pleasant and I did not feel stiff so I
am glad I went, the meeting was very
small I was looking for some old faces
but saw none but H & Susan Bewley
[deletion][/deletion] [insertion]who[/insertion] brought me two letters. I
[unclear]cannot[/unclear] keep something to tell when
I go home. so had better not enter into it

least I should tell it all. I am glad to
hear that Frank & Lucy are to take their
first step the month after next, it seems
very near tho' we are expecting it so long.
I hope neither may be disappointed it is
a solemn engagement to enter upon they
have an advantage over many of knowing
each other being intimate for such a length
of time. give my dear love to them, has Lucy
made her pockets. I made some but I do not
know whether they
will be nice enough
for such an occasion.
[deletion]Elizabeth told me[/deletion]
Eliza I am glad to hear is better is she
staying in town give my dear love to her
& to Elizth I am obliged for her letter which
was very welcome in Cork as I hardly expected
one. tell Sarah I was pleased to
to get her half side and that I intend
to do as she desired me and go home
without much delay. it is almost time
to stop as the post will soon be going so
must bid farewell and with dear love
to each member of the home circle I am
dear Mother thy affecte daughter Selina

Lidya was not at all pleased when I mentioned
my going and said I should not but that will
not keep me now for I am wishing to be home
very much Lyd desires her love to thee Mother Eliza
& [unclear]Lucy[/unclear]
