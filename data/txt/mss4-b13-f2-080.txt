6 O'clock in the evening: Anne poorly, yet enabled to nobly espouse
her Master's Cause: she reminded me of dear Anna Taverner. 22d.. Phebe
& Anne went on their way; we staid with our kind friends, & wrote &c
& at 6 O'clock in the evening had a publick-meeting at Norton, a little
town near 2 miles off, the people behaved well, & I believe S:T &c: were
satisfied with it. 23d.. To meeting in Stockton, a trying one to me, after
it, & two in families, in all which S:T had much labour we
went to Yarm, 4 miles, & lodged at Joseph Procter's, guided thither
by Henry Richardson. 24th.. S:T taken very poorly, much as she
was at Liverpool, did not expect to be able to attend meeting, yet ventur'd
late, & after sitting a few minutes, was enabled by the [unclear]Phycia[/unclear]
of value, to speak in his Glorious cause; soon after which, her pain &
sickness encreasing she went to her lodging, I felt lonesome after [unclear][/unclear]
yet thought I had better stay the meeting out, as Jane Procter [unclear]would[/unclear]
take good care of her, I was not sorry I staid. After dinner ventured
to bring my dear companion, who continued poorly, to our kind
friend
