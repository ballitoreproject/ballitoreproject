I would wish to write a few lines to my dear friend
Mary Shackleton but realy I dont find much matter to write
about at present, & thy last letter is put up so carefully it cann[insertion]ot[/insertion]
be found so thou must excuse any paragraph not being answered
which should, I expect this said Richard Abell
which thou does not seem to know may be the bearer of
this to thy own hand, it may be of use to give him a few
introductory letters, to introduce him to Betsy Beale's
old acquaintance, if I may be allowed to use the word
envy, I believe I shall often envy or rather wish to partake
of the satisfaction he most certainly will feel at seeing
so many worthy friends whom I have so often enjoyed
the company of, tho' it does not seem quite convenient
for me to go with Richard this time to Dublin yet
I expect it will not be so always, if I had a mind to
[April, 1778]

to go now I should have been hard set to meet with a
convenient conveyance ------ I suppose my Amiable
cousin Sally Grub is by this time arrived in her native
Island I shall long to see her, but I suppose my desire
is not equal to one of our Cork Youths, that is
James Abell who I expect will be in a great
hurry to see his old beloved flame, tho' I am apt
to think he has put her out of his head, absence
from any object makes it soon forgotten. it is well
for us it is so, or we should be unhappy beings, we
poor Mortals are so liable to disappointments
of various kinds, that were we always to bear the
remembrance of them we should at last sink under
the load, there is no state in this world that can
ensure a continuance of happiness — Poor Sally
Haughton has buried her younger Son yesterday
he died of the Chin-Cough he [deletion]had[/deletion] [insertion]was[/insertion] grown a fine


boy, her other Son is not very stout —
The clock has struck eleven which seems a reasonable
time to leave off writing; so [insertion]not[/insertion] having much [deletion]time[/deletion]
more to say except to request thou wilt tell thy
Sister Sally I dont forget her but have not
opportunity of sending a scrawl to her now as Rich.d
intends setting out tomorrow morning — So rem[insertion]m[/insertion]
with the usuall salutations of love which I
hope you will accept from your very
I shall not be pleased
if I do not hear from my
[underline]dear Molly[/underline] by return of the
bearer
Cork the of 4th mo 1778
Affectionate
