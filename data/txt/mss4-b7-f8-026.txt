As the approaching Festival will furnish me with an opportunity
of conveying a line to my dear Mary I am determined to
make use of it for I shall hereafter be reduced to the necessity of
watching opportunities as franked covers are [insertion]not[/insertion] easily gotten (I think
how stupid I am to write the thing expressly opposite to what I mean)
The young man who acted in quality of M.P. has lately come
under cognisance of the General Post Office so that I have it not
in my power to procure what thou directed or should long ago
have complied with thy desire. The late mortality among you
affects me afresh whenever I think of it especially that unfortunate
youth carried to an untimely grave. Let us forget
what he was & only consider what he might have been if possessed
of the many advantages of education, good example &c &c
which many naturally his inferiours in point of abilities
enjoy. I have somehow a certain inward regard for the family
which me sorry to hear any thing to their prejudice. It is a
disagreeable circumstance (if true) that what was once poor
[unclear]L[/unclear]iah's property is likely to become a bone of contention to

the Survivors. Forgive me my dear Mary for so long deferring
a recital of my pleasant trip to Clonmel I can assure thee my
intentions were far otherwise when from the top of Fairy hill I
threw a glance over all the surrounding country & admired the
various scenes so often the subject of thy praises. It was late in the
evening when Jemmy Daniell & I climbed the ascent so that I
just saw enough to make me wish the shades of night a little
longer delayed. As I ventured to stay a day longer than the meeting
continued Jemmy & I took a compass of several miles near many
country seats & many masterpieces of Nature I think the environs
of Clonmel much superiour to those of Waterford at least to
what I have yet seen. In the evening we took a walk to
the Wilderness, which is really an astonishing place. I
searched about a considerable time for the tree that bore
your names but all in vain not a trace was to found of
such a respectable company That day extraordinary gave me
to know many of the beauties of the Country but to satisfy
thy enquiries I should have devoted another to have made
my

myself acquainted with the inhabitants I was in company of no
young women except our gentle Friend Rebekah I believe I
need not inform thee I esteem her very much. Neither is my
acquaintance enlarged among the Fair sex in Waterford I am
or at least I imagine I am a person of too inconsiderable
consequence in their eyes to fall under their notice which confines
me to a very limited circle 'tis true Betsey Balfour
are upon a tolerable degree of intimacy but notwithstanding
[unclear][/unclear]er charms the consequences that thou & Sally [unclear][/unclear]ed
[unclear][/unclear] expect in my humble opinion are not likely
An invincible bar to which is â€” but I must not betray
any secret reposed to my trust. My taciturnity (for I know
not to what other quality to ascribe such a mark of distinction)
has inclined more than one to make me their confidant.
The Widow I observe has a close siege laid to her quarters
but what will poor Shapewell do deserted by her once so
constant admirer. Is she yet reduced to a state of despair
by the success of T:C:s plan. It gives me pleasure to hear Ballitore
still continues the seat of the Loves & hope you will all have a
sucession of agreeable admirers to replace those which are gone.
