Part of a letter from Legh Richmond to his
son Wilberforce.
My dear Wilberforce
Shall I have no cause for heartache at my return,
when I inquire how my child has behaved?
how he has attended to his learning? how he has
adhered to the truth in his words? Shall I be comforted
with the glad tidings that your
heart, and your conscience, and your ways
all serve to partake of a happy influence?
That you love to shew your love to Mamma
by keeping her commandments? That you pray
to God to forgive you your sins, and hourly offences?
Do the four walls of your little chamber bear
witness to your prayers and supplications for
yourself and me? Do the sun's rays, as they
early punctuate your window in the morning,
find you early and active to rise, to read, to labour
and to grow in grace?."
Prayer of Legh Richmond's
mother with regard to her son
"Only take heed to thy self, and keep thy soul
diligently, lest thou forget the things which
thine eyes have seen, and let they depart
from thy heart all the days of thy life: but
teach them thy sons, & thy sons' sons." 10/7/46
