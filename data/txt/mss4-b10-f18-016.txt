Larne - July 14th 56
My dear Mamma
I just write a
line to tell you that we
are still here and as it
is a [unclear]post[/unclear] day I dont know
whether we will leave this
any time during the day
or not, but I think it
is not likely - I suppose
 it is to Campbeltown
we will go, when we do.

sail, so do not be uneasy
about us as we are all
quite well, and getting
on very Comfortably the
only drawback is the
wet weather, the people
say it is almost always
raining here - we went
to Church yesterday, [underline]it[/underline]
was a beautiful day, but
today is pouring wet. -
Mr Gowan has not
yet arrived, but we
do not intend to wait
for him when the weather
clears up - I hope Eliza
got all my letters - I
cant write more at present
I want take the first opportunity
I can, to send
this on shore as we
are a long way from
the town - hoping you
are all quite well believe
me with dear love to you
all your Much attached
MJB -
