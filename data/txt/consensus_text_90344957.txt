Trafalgar Terrace -
18th.. - As Aunt Elizabeth had
invited me to spend a few days
here, (when ever I could come) and
as there seemed nothing to prevent
I accompanied Papa Polly & Ned on
their way to the Rock, and then
came here on the car, [unclear] surprised [/unclear]
Florence by coming so soon,
which is quite an uncommon
event with us, as she says it
is [underline]so hard[/underline] to get us. She &
I having chatted to-gether
for some time, lunched &c.
for some time, lunched etc.
[extra line]
went a very nice walk to
the jetty where we saw a
packet starting; and
packet standing; and
[extra line]
while shopping in Kingstown
spied Grandmama's [unclear]carting[/unclear] [/unclear]cashing
and is in it herself and
Aunt Martha. so they stopped
