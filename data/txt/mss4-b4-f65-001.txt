A Letter to Mary Shack[insertion]le[/insertion]ton
The other day I thought a thing
Which to my sister out I bring
I thought if I could but get one night
Of him who is my [insertion]whole[/insertion] delight
A little after I thought this thing
Who but Elsey should pop in
I was very glad I say
For to see him that day
For thought I soon would be ill
And I wanted to see him while I was [insertion]well[/insertion]
For thought I
If I should but d[deletion]i[/deletion]ye
That I ought take a long farewell
That I might take a long farewell
And to my Elsey tell
That I wished him well
So dear sister farewell
And I am thy Faithful Friend
PS
If thou dont answer [insertion]this Sister[/insertion]
I will take it amiss
Sister
Sarah Shackleton
