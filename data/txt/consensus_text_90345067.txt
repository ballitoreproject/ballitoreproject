took tea with us -
2nd.. [insertion]Ballievey House[/insertion] Up pretty early this
morning to prepare
for my journey. Aunt
Eliza and Emmy called
for me and we left
Britain st in time
for the ten O'clock train.
Met Jossy on the platform
so we all travelled together
little George Crawford
came down with us.
The bridge over the
Boyne is tho' not
nearly finished, passable,
consequentley there was
no unpleasant changing
at Drogheda - a great
convenience, as before
in second class.
