Ballitore 11th mo 16th 1832
My dear Eliza
Elizabeth & I expect to leave this
on third day next, she will not be ready sooner
and desires me particularly to mention
to Sally B that she cannot stay longer than
a week, it is rather inconvenient her coming
at all, but I persuaded her as we know not
what might happen to prevent her if she
should put it off. she wishes Sally should
know of her short stay that she may not
feel disappointed. I believe the coach will
not [unclear][/unclear] untill half past three or four, will
it be too late to have the car in town for
us to go out that night or is it better to wait
untill the next day, if it is not too late
it would be pleasanter to go out that night
but there is no moonlight now. I am writing
this in such a hurry I scarcely know
what I am saying, I have only just come
 in from Moone, and have not time for
more. I hope to find you all well at
home, and that I may have nothing to make
me regret staying as long as I did. dear love to my
Mother Manliff & Arthur & thyself also Frederic
I do not intend writing again but hope to see
you on third day if nothing should happen to
prevent farewell and with dear love I am thy
affectionate Sister Selina
Betsy and Elizth. send their love
I gave thy love to Mary Doyle which gratified
her much, has thou consented to come down
here Betsy B. asked me did I give thee the message
