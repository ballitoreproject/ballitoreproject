Ballitore 26 of 10th mo 1818
My dear Elizabeth - We are rather uneasy about the box,
as it should have reach'd Waterford on 7th day evening the
24th I enter'd it in the way bill for that day myself
in [unclear]Tirnolin[/unclear] as a parcel it being wrapp'd up in a
large sheet of brown paper therefore when thou asks
again ask for a parcel directed to Joseph Strangman
but I hope ere this thou hast got it. Jane Abell
brought all safely, I thought thou would like
Deborah Davis I liked her very well,
Paddy Owens who after [insertion]having[/insertion] tried many trades, last
summer took that of an Actor & acted the madman
to very good effect, has latterly commenced open
robber of potato fields, Pat Nowlan caught him
pulling up some of ours & took hold of him [deletion]think[/deletion]
intending to bring him home with him but Paddy
fell flat & pretended to be in a fit & while Nowlan
went to look for his sack he thought to make his
excape but on being caught again he again fell
down & there was left about 5 stone of fine apple
potatos were taken from him, he wishes to go
to jail but on that account this punishment is
carefully avoided therefor he gets off free -
Deborah is as well as usual again, her bonnet
is beginning to look quite reasonable & even
handsome such is the effect of custom
I thought Sam would be for keeping thee over the

the wedding perhaps thou would pay a visit to Aby
in the interim, we dont know when to expect S
White home, My mother will pay due attention to
thy flowers Ellen Glaizebrooks is getting on very well
G. Bewley went to Dublin to day therefore cannot at
present receive thy love Jane Wms tolerably well
only, we will attend to thy command & send the
annual monitor &c &c the first opportunity
Dorcas Fitzgerald has revived a little again the following
is a copy of her last letter to [deletion]N[/deletion] my aunt C
My dear friend october 11th 1818
With much difficulty I now address you.
It has been the divine will to prolong my stay in this world
after hovering on the brink of eternity. I have unspeakable
cause for thankfulness that though my body was
reduced to infant weakness, my spirit was strengthened
& renewed thro' divine grace, and I was given to
enjoy that peace that this world cannot give, I was
given to see that vital christianity consists in a [underline]single[/underline]
[underline]eye to christ[/underline], and [underline]that faith that[/underline] worketh by [underline]love[/underline],
for God is [underline]Love[/underline]! The scriptures were more
clearly open'd to me than ever! If able you shall
hear again from your sincere friend D F G
Thus at 82 she had still more to learn!
If D Davis have done with Melesinas poems [deletion]I[/deletion] my
mother would be obliged to thee to send them home
by Sally White, M Costello wishes to see them
I found a violet in the garden to day a very sweet one

Alfred Haughton continues to mend, Betsy has almost
got rid of her tooth ache I paid 2/6 to the Guard of
the coach for thy box & enter'd it paid in the way bill
thou would see it there if thou would get the way bill
for the 24th to look at, All our neighbours are
well as far as I know, the wash is over & we hope
for fine weather to day the tubs were painted after
a fashion by Jemmy White, they are not yet treated
Jemmy sat [insertion]the market to day[/insertion] shelter'd by Hugh Jackson's gable end
peeling or cutting osiers for a basket, with a wheelbarrow
full of cabbage opposite to him at about 15 yards
distant, he could watch the yard [deletion]the[/deletion] sell the cabbage
& make the basket all at once - admirable m[unclear][/unclear]
Where [unclear][/unclear] fellow, M White call'd here the [unclear][/unclear]
she looks & is I believe very well she as well [unclear]as[/unclear]
thyself is sorry she had not time to bid thee farewell,
Farewell thine sincerly S Leadbeater

For Elizabeth Leadbeater
