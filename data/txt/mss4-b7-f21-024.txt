Stoke House Ap: 19 - 5
You will cease to wonder, my dear Friend, at my apparent [/underline]
neglect of you, when I tell you that I actually left my Family &
Home the last week in October, & have been ever since with my
amiable Lady Bradford, — nay more, that I am actually going
with her next week to Bath!!! are you not ashamed of having
ever felt any thing like a partiality for such an apparently dissipated
Character? for one — who has turn'd her back on all the
natural duties of Life, & sacrificed the affection of the Parent, &
the prudence of the Farmer — to the charms of friendship, of rank,
& of fortune! before my gentle Friend quite disowns me, she shall
take a peep behind the Curtain, & judge of my [underline]Motives[/underline] rather than
[unclear][/unclear] actions — When I arrived here, it was with an expectation of
accompanying dear Lady B to Bath in ten days time, — but I
found her worthy Steward, who has served her most faithfully &
affectionately for upwards of 40 years, in a state which threaten'd
Mortification, — in such a state his beloved Mistress had too much
heart to leave [underline]him[/underline] - & I too much to leave [underline]her[/underline] — We have ever since
been watching the slow progress of his returning health, & it is only

just now that we conceive him equal to the journey — My
beloved Friend's house is situated in a beautiful Vale, but in a
Country remote from such Society as she would wish to associate
with — Nature & Fortune have both been most liberal of their
Gifts to her, but they could not secure her from the sufferings of
Mortality,— many, & severe have been her afflictions, & they have
so depress'd her Spirits, that she is only a noble Ruin of what
she has been — She could ill reconcile herself to the possibility
of losing a valued Servant, on whom she trusts in a great degree
for her remaining comforts; & I could not leave her a prey to
melancholy anxiety — I shall do little more than see her
settled at Bath, & then return to my long left home — Look
on your Map for Derbyshire, then follow me to Bath, & from
thence to Coniston, — & you will believe no common affection
would induce me to take so long a journey alone, & that it
is not what the World calls [underline]Pleasure[/underline] which has beguiled me from my
humble Cottage so long — I am much obliged by the little poem
you have sent me, it is so accurate a description of Ballitore, that
it brings every spot to my remembrance, & I assure you I never
think of my many Friends there, but with pleasing satisfaction —

I am glad you have got such an agreable addition to your Society
as the Scotch farmer, & his fascinating Sister! — They too, are most fortunate,
in being fix'd amongst Minds congenial to their own, which I judge
must be the case, from your account of them — Of our worthy Thomas
Wilkinson I can tell you little, but that he was well about two months
since, — beloved & esteem'd he ever must be, by all Those who love native
Genius & a guileless Heart — Turpin sets off next Monday for Dublin
on a visit to a Brother who is settled there, & lately come from America.
She dearly loves him, & therefore it was impossible to refuse my consent
to her going, — tho' I much fear he only presses
her visit, in the hope of purloining from her [unclear][/unclear]
[unclear]ea[/unclear]rnings of many years Service — on this subject I have strongly
caution'd her, but I shall not be easy till she is safe at Coniston again;
for if ever there was an artful —, I believe he is one — My Man of War
is on the Recruiting Service at Grantham, — my Daughters at home,
my 2d son (a Lieut: in the Engineers) just embarking for the West Indies —
my 3d Son enter'd at Oriel College Oxford — & Louis at School, he is
very much grown, & improved in health & looks,—but his Nerves are
still weak; & when I press him to chuse some line of profession for his
future life, he bursts into a flood of tears, & says "I will live at home, & be
a Farmer",—poor fellow! I know not what to do with him—

You desired to know all about us, so you will not complain of my
Egotism. Remember me very kindly to all my Friends, & assure them
I am incapable of ever forgetting their kind affections — For yourself —
my dear Mary, believe that I am with great Esteem, very affectionately [unclear]Wm.[/unclear]
I rely on your fulfilling your promise of burning my scrawls — [unclear]JS[/unclear]
I never made nor never would make
[unclear]that[/unclear] promise
