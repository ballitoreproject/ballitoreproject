evening together chatting and reading.
16th.. Last night just before going
to sleep all of us being in bed,
Bridget came to my door to tell me
that Mr White was at the hall door
trying to get in, so I got the key and
sent her down, having in vain endeavoured
understand the facts of the case.
We were all greatly surprised to see
him as we did not expect him
at all. he came he told us for
his letters which had been sent
on here. at about twelve Polly, Lid
Dick and I went down on the car
with him as at last he had to go for
good and all - Tempted by the lovely
day and his persuasions we
drove as far as the Railway bridge
at this side of which we set him
down - he was to walk from that to
De Veci lodge-. Papa Mama [deletion]and[/deletion]
[deletion]Charlie[/deletion] came out after tea -
to make sleepy Charlie
