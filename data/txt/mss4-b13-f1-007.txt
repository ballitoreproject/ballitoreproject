when called, he was desired to lie down again, till he was clearer in discerning the call: M: D recommended a state present to lie down again, & they would hear the call again clear, she believed. Took tea at the school, after tea W. Leadbeater & I called to see W: Pim ^who was into[?]^ & M: R, & A: Sparkes. First-day morning meeting was silent, afternoon M: Ridgway appeared in testimony very comfortably: my father & M: D, went to visit some families, I met my dear Nancy Shannon at Alice Pim’s, I did not know but that perhaps we might have been favoured a little together, but this burdening chat begun, & kept on, much to A: S’s disappointment; as to me, I seemed I thought more than satisfied, for I felt my usual weakness & unfitness to present myself thus+. Second day dined at Mungo Bewleys, went in the evening to Natl: Jackson’s, where I did hope perhaps we might have had some quiet, but the evening passed stupidly; save that I had a few minutes conversation with dear Fanny Strangman to my satisfaction; I do feel a great deal of love for her, & heartily wish she may not give way to too great diffidence: Third-day spend the forenoon at Mungo Bewley’s, helping them to plait: dined
+even, “before the Lord”
