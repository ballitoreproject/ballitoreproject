63 Thomas street 10th mo: 1817
My dear Deobrah
Thy money acted like magic on me for
it was want of it that prevented me from executeing
thy commissions for I would do more than that with
pleasure for thee. I send Jane Murphy & would be
rejoiced to go myself but that the warning was
too short & Harriet Lesanu told me my mother
gave me leave to spend another week with them
& in consequence of that I deferred going to J
Wrights till next 2nd day & spent part of the
week with the Bewleys of Bridge Street most
agreeably & the remainder with the Lefanus
I am afraid I act contrary to my parents wishes
&[insertion] it[/insertion] makes me very uncomfortable & I [deletion]will[/deletion] [insertion]shall[/insertion] be
so till I get a letter from home. If I can
I will get the knives this evening. I wish I
was at home to [deletion]saw[/deletion][insertion]see[/insertion] by your countenances,
whether I do right or not. After meeting today
Mary C & I set off to for the female orphan
house & spoke to the girl herself Harriet
I hope I shall see T. Fisher home but I am mighty sorry
he is going to leave Ballitore ah! my poor Latin who will
be so kind & so patient with me my love please to him
My very dear love to all when is Sarah expected home
& is is likely J. White will succeed?
I would be glad the money for Jane Murphy was sent me
as I had to borrow it from M Chandlee as it was not
convenient to my uncle to pay her fare.

Howell was not at home she had her clothes
ready & we ordered her to be here at 1/2 past
6 tomorrow morning & accompany my uncle
I intend buying a band box in [underline]hell[/underline] to put thy
bonnet in & if thou would rather I would
not I can keep it when I go home. I long to
see thee & judge myself whether thou art improving
in thy good looks. I would be mighty
glad to have a long letter form thee & tell me
whether Harold improves or not. Alexander
[deletion]tells me[/deletion] Bewley took [insertion]off[/insertion] my profile last night
it is reckoned very like I hope to get me myself
for my own friends. Like Eneas thou may
see I would go to Earths confines for thee
even to the regions beneath for a bandbox
Farewell thine dearest Deborah for the [unclear]prese[/unclear]
PS I read somewhere that a lady never wrote [deletion]up[/deletion]
the purport of her letter till the postscript I
hope it is not the case but at any rate
Mary C & I went since I wrote the above [deletion]went[/deletion]
Lydia Jane Leadbeater

to get the said bonnet or rather the hat-bonnet
we went to several shops & at the very cheapest
& least fashionable they had none of the kind
thou would'st wear but all a kind of Lancers
hat now much worn they said they would
make a bonnet if it was bespoke but not under
20/s as they took much more fur there is scarce
any thing else worn now & they are much dearer
this year than last, they say. Would'st thou
go to that price, it would last a long time
& I beleive look well to the last.
I should be glad to know thy definitive
soon. The [insertion]cheapest[/insertion] person I was with said she
would rather have a pattren cut in paper & then
she could follow [deletion]the [/deletion] it & make it exactly to
thy fancy. All the others would not make a
bonnet less than 26/s & a hat 18/s without any
leaf scarce. Ah! do write soon to me. The
[insertion]money[/insertion] letter my father sent to John Wright I delivered
the day after I got it but it was not given to
me for 2 or 3 days after it came to town so I
am not to be blamed for that. My very dear love to

Elen. you must be lonesome without Sarah
& I flatter myself you sometimes miss & perhaps
wish for me. I dreamed last night I was just
come home & was kissing thee & crying with joy
but thou asked had I brought home thy bonnet, &
I said no but that I bespoke it & it was to cost
13 guineas & thou cried oh! Lyddy & I awoke &
found Jane Bewley calling Lyddy to get up. Farewell
again my dear sister thine ever Lydia Jane Leadbeater
