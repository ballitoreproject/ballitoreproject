however did not go on account
of the wet I believe. Papa returned
here again. Mary Gough
dined here and staid the
night. The weather appeared
so broken the the pic-nic which
was to be on fifth day was postponed.
12th.. A beautiful morning
after all so the picnic need
not have been put off. About
2 O'clock I went on an errand
for Ned to Simmons Walpole's
and home by Capel St.
I forgot to say Uncle Thomas
[unclear]Cole[/unclear] breakfasted with us, he
[insertion]seemed[/insertion] much better I believe.
At about five Margt and I
went out to drive on John's
outside car, The park looked
very pretty and we enjoyed
it very much, the dust was
nicely laid by a shower.
