8th.. I came to town this morning by
the Bray train and was in time to go
to meeting and see Anne Eliza Millner

wedding only eight couples. The bride
looked very nice and interesting and was
dressed in pale violet coloured silk, white
bonnet and veil. She spoke clearly
but rather low. Florence was with me

Elizabeth and little Edward called to see
us this morning also.
