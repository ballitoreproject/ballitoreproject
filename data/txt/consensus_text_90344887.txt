previous day when walking
in the Dargle- As the car or
rather part of it had to be
mended, it was nearly 12 1/2

O'clock ere we set off
I do not think Susan enjoyed
joyed her dip much, as
her dip much, as
the sea was very rough for
bathing however that was
not to be helped. On our
return which was not till

2 1/2 O'clock I think, we found
Aunt Elizabeth, Florence, & Jane
who had come uninvited
to dinner "taking pity on
our lonliness" as they said
Susan altho' she had almost
agreed to stay to dinner,
