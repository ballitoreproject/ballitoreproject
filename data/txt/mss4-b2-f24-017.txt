My dear Father,

	Thy very acceptable letter I received; & find by it thou art much afflicted by the loss of your lovely infant, I think thou should not let it too much distress thy spirits, tho the manner of his death is peculiarly distressing, being attended by those painful reflections which thou movingly describes, yet let us consider it was done with a view for the Childs preservation, & meant only to prevent a worse Evil by anticipating it, if the children had taken the disorder naturally, & one or two of them had died of it, there might be Self upbraiding for neglecting this (mostly) successful means of escape, my Brother & our own Mother were heavily visited by this disease, & thou buried one child by it, & therefore as this has happened, & is over, let us not sorrow overmuch, but endeavour to be comforted with some palliating reflections, I believe thou never advised any of us to it, thou did not decry the practice as some others do, & I should still be afraid to be either sanguine for or against it. I am obliged to thee for thy truely [sic] acceptable advise [sic] to me, & thy sentiments correspond with my own feelings.
	I observe my dear Father thou seems uneasy about my future situation or place of abode, which I was concerned at, as I cannot say I am so myself, I am persuaded it is my Husbands wish to do all in his power to make me comfortable, he took this House I now live in with that design, & it answered then for a business which has since dwindled away to nothing, & is not adequate to the support of his encreasing [sic] charge, thro the mercy of kind Providence, other means, in other business has been cast up, for us, but this is not the place to follow that business in, & therefore he endeavoured to provide the best House he could for me in a place convenient for the business, it is now painting, & I hope if thou & my dear Mother were to see it you would entertain a more pleasing opinion of it, I long much to see you here: we have some apprehension that Thomas Chaylor will take this House from us, but are not certain as yet altho there is a shop to the House we have taken, & we talk of doing something in that way, yet we do not depend much on that, having other business of more consequence which we may explain to thee if we be favoured to meet. Thou hast seen some of my letters to my Mother relative to Brother Johns relative proposal about letting us take my Fathers house, but as we hear nothing from him now on the subject, & that we believe he does not incline to let us have it we drop thinking of it, & turn ourselves to accommodate ourselves & our little family in the best manner in our power, though I am sure my Husband wishes for that house, & my Mother ^says she^ is determined to leave it, & go to live with sister Hannah.
	Debby did indeed write me a sad scolding letter, but I deserved a scold, & I hope she did not believe all she said.
We & our children are at present thro favour pretty well, my Mother very feeble & weakly, I have not heard from Sally since she went to Cork, do you hear from her? & how was she the last account? Our dear love attends you all.
	& am your
		dutiful & affectionate daughter

22 This morning I received a valuable letter from my dear Brother, I do heartily sympathize in his affliction, & have felt deeply with him, but I trust the hand that has wounded will heal, & that it is a dispensation that will be sanctified to the praise of the great dispenser, & his own everlasting good, & that he will be ^made^ a polished, bright instrument in ^the great^ hand of the [word crossed out] ^former^. I have felt more than I commonly do on this occasion, I mention it in diffidence & fear, but it arose in my mind, & I could say more than I shall venture to do.
I request thou wilt send the enclosed as directed, if convenient to enclose the two to England in a frank, sister ^&^ I would be obliged to thee, I have left mine for thee to seal as thou used to desire it, tho not worth thy perusal, & hope it will not be known that I do so. [very faint ink] Does poor Bet Brady continue at my Brothers?
