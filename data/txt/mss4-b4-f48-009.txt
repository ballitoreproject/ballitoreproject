My dear Betsy,
Little has occurred since you went [unclear]with penning[/unclear]. I need not tell thee of the
thunder storm that morning, but we have had the pleasure of hearing of your safe arrival
in Dublin, & expect the next account will present you to our view admiring the
beautiful surrounding scenery & the neat cottages which have delighted me so much in the
days that are past. I refer to Eliz. to tell thee of her return, she & Deborah I believe
mean to fill a sheet. I proposed our joining in one but they seemed so full of matter
that I feared I would be thrust & elbowed into a corner by their young Baedships.
On First-day morning Goodnature added another trophy to her [deletion]victories [/deletion]triumphs by a
letter which I received from Wm. Smith in his wife's name, recommending Carmichael
(of whom they had only heard the evening before, telling the very number he lives at)
for Helen Christy, whose illness I had mentioned. What kind of generous attention to the
welfare of a distant stranger! It struck me more than any other instance of their benevolence
which had come to my knowledge. Eliz. Johnson has been very ill since first
day, with a bilious colick I believe, her spirits got very low, & she talked of returning
home. I wish we may be able to prevail upon her to alter that proposal. She is better
to day. Abby is very assiduous in her tender attention to her dear Mother.
22d Thomas Johnson came this morning in the [unclear]Waterford [/unclear] Coach, about 3 o'clock,
found Betty much better, but in so poor a state of health, as to induce them to conclude
upon going to-morrow. to-morrow, Jane Thomas returns to Ballitore & leaves
the Hespirian Fruit unguarded. Little does she think that the Dragon is on her
way back. Ah sweet Abby I never loved or admired her more, & I cannot understand
the prohibition. Her Mother & I never mentioned the subject to each other.

I really am ashamed of sending thee the little scrap I am like to send thee, but if
ever wight was hurried I have been this week. Our clothes not all quite dry yet in
hands since second-day - the wet of the elements & the heat of the kitchen fire
have [unclear]damned [/unclear]and [unclear]scorched[/unclear] my ideas, which used to flow so freely to thee. I miss
thee much indeed, but will more when the company leaves us. Jane[unclear] Mt. gomery[/unclear]
came to day with Aunt Chandlee & Thomas a fine youth. Saml. Haughton escorted
them, but seems not to incline to stay [underline]now[/underline] which WL imputes to a certain reason
I cannot but grudge thy paying 6d for this, & could keep it for more news, but
that I have opportunity of sending it by J: Johnson as far as Dublin which is a
[underline]saving[/underline], & still more I grudge thy paying for Deborah's nonsense only a little
of this sense I lacked thereto, & they are not content but you should get them
& perhaps in the main they are as well as my own. I long for a letter from
thee, & to hear thy opinion of that beautiful country, but let in not reduce thy
heart from they "little native vale", nor let the smart, sensible Northerns noal
the own dear Nokes's at home, [deletion]of[/deletion] these who are not Nokes's are in no
danger from rivalry. Hannah Boake went to the Grove first day, not returned
I believe. Present me most afftly to all my friends there, who are many and well
beloved, & besure to thy father Mary & thyself
Sally Grogan [deletion]has[/deletion] lay in of a daughter:
Counsellor Colles very ill with a complaint
in his head, tis feared paralytick
Saml H: tells us Ben has been ill with a cramp
in his stomach. I am anxious about him
thine dearly

K: Kealinge to ML - Impromptu
a tribute from a friend for thy sweet lays,
a [underline]golden[/underline] crown you merit 'stead of bays.
Reply
when from the feeling, liberal mind
Such sweet applause our [underline]labours[/underline] find,
Do we not value more the praise
Than crown of gold or wealth of bays? ML
Rejoinder
Say can a withered trunk prolific shoot?
Or blasted tree produce autumnal fruit
As well may I aspire in bays like thine
With sweetness, harmony & taste to [deletion]pro[/deletion] shine
But believe me, dear Madam, in simple prose your very sincere admirer &
ML to K:K who had received her in an apartment where her Book was compliment
with Laurel wreaths &c
And shalt thou not, mine honour'd page
Despise the grim Reviewer's rage.
Since from that heart [deletion]whence[/deletion] [insertion]where[/insertion] kindness [deletion]flows[/deletion] glows
Since from that life whence sweetness flows,
Since from that hand, which taste obeys,
Thou win'st the rich reward of praise?
Whilst roses amidst laurels shine
And whilst such hands their charms combine.
Shalt thou by Vanity betray'd,
Whilst that this wreath may never fade? ML
