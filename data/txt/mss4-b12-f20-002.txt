My dear Thos. & Eliza
Lucy Emily & I came to Town yesterday by the Train which arrived
at 3 & here we are now just after breakfast - expecting the Car in soon
to take Emily to the Glen - her Cough is I am glad to say better -
[deletion]I write[/deletion] I wrote a Letter [insertion]to[/insertion] you in Dunlavin, the day before you sail'd
(Wednesday Week) to say "farewell" - but unfortunately was late for
Post, being Market day, so the Letter did not go farther than Britain
St. when I sent it next day on [unclear]chaise[/unclear] to Arthur, to try could it
overtake you in England, but he said not, so it remain'd unsent -
I wish'd to tell you how very much it would have gratified
me to let Emily accompany you; nothing of the Kind for
a long time offer'd so tempting & I am greatly obliged for
your proposal & for your wishing to have her & nothing but
afear of the sever weather Call'd away in a hurry

My dear Eliza they have left me this scrap of room, so I must use
it to tell you how very much obliged & gratified I felt at receiving your
kind note from London, & I am very glad you had such a comfortable Journey
so far; but I have been thinking of you very often since, which listening
to the high winds which we have had since Sunday, however people tell
me you may not have had them crossing to Ostend; still I am longing
to hear that you are safe over the sea - Lucy as you know by the above
(I suppose) is with me & desires her dear love to you & Thos. & to tell the latter
that she has received the book, for which she is greatly obliged -
[underline]Later[/underline] Since writing the above I have heard of your safe arrival at Liege I feel
rejoiced - There has been a letter from Sam to Mary - alls well - he wants to know
did Thos. receive the letter (the one Thos. answered) I intend writing to him by the [insertion]next[/insertion] packet -
Fred desires his love
to you & Thos. I think
he is now finely -
Will you give my best
Love to Thos & you may
give him as large a
portion as [underline]you[/underline] think
it prudent for him
to receive, & after that,
I will give you a [unclear]big[/unclear]
fair quantity for yourself
from your much attached
Sister [unclear]M.B[/unclear]

My dear Aunt
I have just come in to see Aunt E. & as she was writing & offered
me the pen I cannot refuse the opportunity of addressing thee though
indeed I have a little to say. We go on pretty much as you left us. Richd
came to town ere yesterday partly to get fresh advise, which on second
thoughts has not seemed needful at least as yet. The swelling is gradually
decreasing, but the poor fellow looks badly & seems weak, but
his spirits are tolerably good. His faithful friend Dr. Moss is unremitting
in his attentions. The rest are well. Lily at Glendruid until
we call for her tomorrow [unclear]Linsesorcy Joy[/unclear] in town to wish on Dick a
Philip keeping house at Farrasoe. I read thy hasty note from
London. Grandmamma came over the day it arrived: [unclear][/unclear] is very
glad to hear of your intention of going to Croydon. Polly & Selina have
[unclear][/unclear] we must have been robbed of speech for delight at seeing you
I hope soon to hear through some of thy letters how you found them
We are about getting a steady person as housekeeper which would
be very pleasant indeed if we are fortunate enough to get one that
will answer; it would take a great weight off my shoulders: and
make the boys much more comfortable. I much intend so farewell
with sincere love to [underline]all[/underline] your party I am thy affec neice Margaret.
many thanks for the
material.
