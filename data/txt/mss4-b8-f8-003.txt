Dear Elizabeth
I return you Suliot's
letters with many thanks, I have
sent the journal to R D webb,
To judge of Suliot's character by
what it appears from his letters
it must be an interesting one, it is
a pity he looks at the gloomy side
of human nature so much for a person
so young, what cause he may have
for doing so, I know not.
I received your note on Sunday
morning at Glan-once by Richard

I hardly expected him. I thank
you for your caution with respect
to being laughed out of nursing
May, I do not think Eliza would
say a word against it, and even
if she did laugh, I am too great
a stickler for freedom of actions
when they are not improper in
my [insertion]own[/insertion] mind, to give up for any of
my friends laughs.
I scarcely see May at all now
and am afraid I cannot nurse
and [unclear]hoise[/unclear] her as often as you [insertion]would[/insertion] wish
I see her at dinnertime, she is beginning
to take great notice of people,
to day she caught hold of my
[underline]fathers finger, (who dined with us)[/underline]
and held it for a long time staring
at him all the time, as if she
wanted to read his countenance
smiling at him now and then as if
it pleased her, which I hope it
may do when she becomes older
and able to form an opinion.
My flowers are growing and my
pears only middling being eaten
I believe by the Sparrows. We had
a glorious day at Loughbrea not
a thought of business entering my
head all the time I enjoyed it
fully Yrs John B Junr
