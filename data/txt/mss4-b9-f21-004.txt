My dear Lucy
I w'd be very much obliged
to thee if thou would send
me one of Frank's little

Crismus I shall not keep it
long perhaps Elizth wd be
kind enough to bring it
to me, it is very pleasant
that he has such fine
weather for Enniscorthy
will thou & I were there
once & Francis too.

& she knows what we
may do again when we
all grow ordely & elderly
I hope the Scotch party is
enjoying itself
ever thy SB
