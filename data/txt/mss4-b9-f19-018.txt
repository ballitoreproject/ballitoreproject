Ballitore 14th of 8th month 1815.
My dear Elizabeth
As thou wish'd for a circumstantial
letter I am going to give thee one as I can authorize
a newspaper better than any thing else.
My aunt Sally came home on seventh day
along with Hannah Watson, her son & daughter
they are very agreeable people particularly the old
woman who is preserving the green old age which
Wm. Lefanu so well describes in one of his
Sunday readings she is cheerful & kindly & very
polite. My aunt brought a letter from [unclear]S Gatchell[/unclear]
which I enclose she [insertion]IE my aunt[/insertion] desires me to give her love
thee & too tell them that Benjamin Knotte
has ask'd for Eliza Penrose its not known
at least to no whether she will accept
him or not. I had a long letter from Debo' -
a few days ago which tells us to write next
to John Handcocks, [underline]Lisburn[/underline]. C's legs are
better & he is now able to walk as well as
[underline]usual[/underline] Jane Bewley not gone yet George breakfasted
with this morning & proposed us making
a party to [unclear][underline]Bonilgliah[/underline][/unclear] as Jane Bewley
would like to go the Creightons are very
agreeable but rather idle Richard is
their constant visitor he comes to teach
Bessie Italian & [deletion]J[/deletion] to talk to Jane
Peggy Lucas's mother came home yesterday
to settle things for Johnny, the little child
is with Alley Whelan but as there was no

agreement yet about it she is [insertion]still[/insertion] suckling her
own child a little girl of 1 1/4[ insertion]year[/insertion] old. I was at
the mo meeting last 6th day & got from A Murray
2Â£ they owe more but as they had not time to
settle the account they only gave me that
the [insertion]terrific[/insertion] Bankrupt is gone from Carlow
the [insertion]terrific[/insertion] Bankrupt is gone from Carlow
& M Murray dont think there is any occasion
for lessening the prices of thine
Wat: Farmer came home from the
County Wicklow where he was bathing
for the good of his R[deletion]r[/deletion]heumatiz'. Catherine
Grattan getting better but poor Wm. was laid
up a whole day with the rheumatizm in
his head, we all spent an evening there
lately & had the compa[insertion]n[/insertion]y of Colley Grattan
his wife & Miss Kenedy. Sally Pim sent
no money by my aunt I dont know what
hinder'd her as it could not be that
she had not timely notice of the opportunity
James White has got 2 new boys since
he came home I wish all were collected
together again the Metcalfs are not to come
back [deletion]b[/deletion] how is my poor aunt thy being
there will keep her up I am rejoiced
thou went & hast thou any notion when thou
canst come back again Lydia is getting
finely & sometimes washes up the tea things
so thou sees I'm not without help I believe
she will not be let to go to Dublin this
year & I'm afraid Charlotte will not

favor us with her comp[insertion]n[/insertion]oy I have not
heard from her since thou went Mary
Chandlee has given up all thought
of coming to Ballitore as Tommy is not
going from home she has become
a great friend of Eliza Gough they go
every morning together [insertion]to the botanic garden[/insertion] to hear Doctor
Trade lecture on Botany this is good exercise
for them both & may be very good
for their health but I believe they do not
reap any other advantage from it
I forgot to tell thee that Sally Leckey & John
Christy presented their Marriage at the
last mo meeting I wish we had a [unclear]better[/unclear]
Clerke [insertion]writing[/insertion] than the prestent one Sally [unclear]C[/unclear]
was call'd one to read [underline]Betsy[/underline] Barrington
having a cold on her chest, she did it very
well Betsy Barrington sat by F B till
the presentation was over & after that it
was that J C was call'd to the table
Anna Leckey is grown a great creature
she and Bessie & the two little ones were
at meeting. Poor Charlotte Neale dont
seem to grow any better I believe the
Doctor has no hopes of her recovering
Hannah Boake is very well was at
meeting yesterday dress't in all her finery
We enclose
a Waterford
note for 1 pound

excuse all mistakes as I could not have patience
to read all this over. We went Glass Laley yesterday
evening Bessie & Jane & Lydia & I a
fine chaise full for so we went
I hope Ben Knott may succeed but then
what would poor Wm. [unclear]Pecte[/unclear] do. We expect
Counsellor Collis his wife & eldest son to
spend to morrow evening with on their
way from Kilkenny MD & JB are to
Breakfast with us to morrow morning
the latter is to go home on 4th day next
George spent yesterday evening at E B's [deletion]their[/deletion]
he is very [underline]industrious[/underline] he will be greatly
surprized to find that they breakfasted at
the Mill this morning while he was unfortunately
here M Chambers is here [deletion]alone[/deletion] & brough
[deletion]with him he[/deletion]
[underline]money letter[/underline]

Clonmel
For Eliz. Leadbeater
along with her little Maria &
her maid [unclear]she[/unclear] looks just as
