I doubt not but thou wishes me, & thy friends in general to increase, in the manner thou mentioned, & that the attendance of our general Meetings might be a means of strengthening us, to come up more devotedly in the way of our duty, as Truth may clearly point out, But I can say little [paper torn] myselfI hope sister Sally was the better for her [paper torn] journeyfor she scattered more amongst us, last third day, than she did for a Considerable time beforeI am pleased I carried my own burthen, & wish I may be preserved from bringing forth any thing, that is not Genuine. Dr. Abrahams lines [?] were truly comfortableMay he still more & more manifest himself to be one of the children of Abraham, by doing the works of Abrahammy wife &c. joins me in affectionate regard to thee & thine Molly & Sally  thy Loving friend
