Dr. Wm
J Gavin called at my house on saturday
last when I was absent from home, he left three
Guineas with my wife which I should not have taken
myself as I told him any payment which he made
must be thro' you, he proposed to pay the arrears by installments,
I must [unclear]traible[/unclear] to let me know if he will
settle the account, I furnished you some time ago with
his acct I met him a day or two before he called at my
house &he promised to give up the little paddock, [underline]immediately[/underline],
which I would not set longer than for the
season of grass, as I should hope, some time or other, it
might be set for building upon. I enclose you a letter
of N. Walsh I must beg you will let me know whether
he performs the promise contained in his letter -
I would thank you to acquaint Gannon and [unclear]Boulger[/unclear]
that I shall certainly cause them to be arrested
and as there is a military force in Ballitore I ventured
to think, it would not be difficult, to have
this business quietly effected. As to Gavin I have but
little

little dependence upon Gavin's promise, but I am
determined that he shall not impose upon me any
longer. If you should have any opportunity I would
be obliged to you to let her know that I will eject
her & that she as representative of her husband will
be obliged to pay the arrears and the expence of the
ejictment - I enclose a [unclear]nexxs[/unclear] for Newlon. I would
thank you to tell Lennan that as he did not choose
to send me Beef - I must insist when being paid
the rent due by him, as I can no longer suffer
any of my tenants to humbug me [deletion]any longer[/deletion]
with best regards to your wife and all my
other friends in Ballitore -
I am your's
Sincerely
B Wills
