	While we see with deep concern our friends whom we cannot help, a prey to the enemies of their own houses, may we study to be quiet & do our own business - & this business I apprehend to be quietly to wait for the operation of that power in our minds respectively, which will enable us to keep up the daily sacrifice of a broken & contrite spirit - & also in simplicity & integrity to do that which is our reasonable duty; as well as to be prepared & ready for those services which an increase of care & progress in religious experience must unavoidably bring upon us. I am glad that J. N. shews himself humbled under some religious sense - it must be a great comfort to his worthy grandfather & if he be preserved so as to persevere in the right way, it will be a great comfort to the Church. He seemed to me when I was there somewhat thoughtful about the best things - the Author of all Good is not wanting in extending his gracious, condescending visitations to the youth but the youth are many of them too much wanting in making a total surrender: they say as it were to the heavenly visitation, "Hitherto shall thou come, & no farther": they are not willing to be sufficiently reduced, & to become vile in the eyes of their former acquaintance: they do not humbly & diligently enough wait for the baptism of Truth, to wash, to purify, to strengthen their hands hearts - the world, in one shape or other, comes & supersedes the lively, profitable impressions - the fowls of the air pick up the seeds on the briars & thorns prevail to choke it - like the young man in the gospel, they reject the terms, & go away, though perhaps not so sorrowful as he was. I wish this may not be the case with him, nor with any who have been thus mercifully favoured.
