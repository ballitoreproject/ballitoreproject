My dear friend
I could not think of letting
Lydia go without sending thee a few lines, to thank
thee for thy addition to my George's letter, which was most
acceptable, although I should be very glad to hear from
thee yet I would think such a favour, too much to expect
very frequently, considering Lydia's prior claim to thy pen.
I congratulate thee on getting Lydia among you again,
although we shall miss her very much, her great flow of
spirits enlivens our dull circle very much, it will seem
like old times to you to have her in Ballitore again.
I was sorry that poor Deborah's state of health should
be the cause of hastening James and Lydia's visit, I hope
the voyage to Holyhead may benefit her, and In the [unclear]tour[/unclear]
through Wales if not too much for her strength, we have the
finest part of the year before us, which all invalids seem
to look forward to, as a means of recruiting health.

we are anxiously hoping that the summer may remove
my father's long protracted illness, the damp weather
we have just now, depresses him, we had hoped from
the favorable report we were enabled to give a week or
two ago, that he would advance rapidly,[deletion]but [/deletion] he is still
bilious and his liver much affected, but we hope the other
complaint is removed. He still keeps his room, except
when a fine day admits of his going out; he has been
taking dandelion, we think with good effect.
It is very trying to see him so long suffering, it [deletion] very[/deletion] [insertion]is[/insertion]
a great favour that he is so very patient.
It feels very unpleasant to me to be obliged to try the
patience of my dear George so long, but I seem as if I
could not be easy to leave my father until I should [deletion]less [/deletion] see
him much better at least. I suppose thou heard that
Thomas and Sarah are in Edinburgh, enjoying each other's company
it was curious that they should go in company; we think
it is probable that Thomas may come over to Ireland this summer.
I hope Lydia will be able to prevail on Mary Shackleton
to come home with her, we should all be rejoiced to have
her here; we miss poor Betsy very much. I wish we could get

her here again. I look forward with great pleasure
to seeing thee here this summer. I think thou ought to spend
some weeks with us to return Lydia's visit.
I hope Jacob has before this safely landed in America,
we miss him very much, but look forward to seeing him
in 2 years more. I suppose Lydia wrote you of the
birth of Reuben's daughter, she is called Rebecca.
With dear love to thy husband, thy sister Sally, Elizabeth
and Richard, I remain thy ever affectionate
Hannah [unclear]Perhithy[/unclear]
