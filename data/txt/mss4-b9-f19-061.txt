Britain St 14th of 7th mo 1823
My dear Elizth I write thus early to apologize
for coming away without taking leave of thee
I don't know how it happen'd but blame the
hurry of the Coach I did not think of it tile
we had just set off & I was very much vx'd
with my self & "what will Elizth say after all
her kindness"? but I hope thoul't excuse me
we met very agreeable [insertion]quiet[/insertion] company two
friends who made not objection to poor Mag
who bore the journey very well sleeping
& most of the time & now looks very watery
most of the time & now looks very watery
but could laugh for her father so she is
not very sick I hope I amused my self
with Psyche & the strawberries on the way
we met my father & Eliza here [insertion]Ed[/insertion] brought the
car to the Coach office for us & we were
at home before 4 o clock & are not much
threds. I thought Dublin look'd very cloudy & dull as
we enter'd, but pleasant faces on our arrival made
up for the dullness of Dublin I hope you will hear
from lyd tomorrow & that I shall hear from you soon
after I will not forget M R's letter - all was quiet
on the 12th no sign of disturbance I must go & put
the flowers in water they look a little faded by the
journey adieu for the present I hope soon to hear
from thee & intend writing by R H ever thine EB
E Gough is at Glendmid I hope she injoys Mr [unclear]Keepelly's[/unclear]
company Selina is gone to be school'd & I am
alone dear love to all - how lonely I feel
without you

Eliza would be much obliged for the loan
of [unclear]Gestmote[/unclear] of Wyoming perhaps Kennagl would
bring it
