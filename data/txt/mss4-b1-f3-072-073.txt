			R. S. to his Daughter Deborah.

				Ballitore 16th of Ninthmonth 1779.
	Thy letter, my dear Debby, besure [sic], alarmed us yesterday, though couched in the most moderate terms. We hardly know sometimes how dear persons and things are to us, till we are in danger of losing them. ** I know: and at times feel the instability and uncertainty of visible enjoyments. I am sensible that we have not long to stay together on this earth. Our conflicts and troubles here will soon be over; and if, through the mercy of Divine Providence, we be preserved from evil while here, our souls will be centered in rest and peace hereafter. It therefore becomes us all to seek after resignation, and submission to that high and holy hand, which doth all things well. Perhaps, by this dispensation of affliction and pain, he means to reduce the creaturely part of our dear child; to purify her spirit, & prepare it to offer those sacrifices without blemish, with which he is always well pleased: sacrifices not kindled by the fire of her own lively imagination, nor offered upon an altar raised by any artificial tool; but those spiritual hymns, and songs, and melody, which are of divine origin, and still tend towards their original, ascending and descending, like Jacob’s ladder, which had communication between earth and heaven.
	In the tenderest manner whisper in my dear child’s ear, that I love her very dearly, and hope in due time to embrace her in my fond arms;--that the neighbours and friends, and relations here are very inquisitive about her;--and that her speedy recovery is the subject of our earnest desires. It seems unnecessary for me to say further, while her tender and excellent mother is near. *** I need not bid thee do all in thy power to keep up thy mother’s spirits; but I charge thee, endeavour to support thy own.
	
							R. S.
