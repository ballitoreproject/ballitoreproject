nice carved oak -
The other appurtenents
of the house are handsomely
furnished, but too gloomy
to please me - the domain
itself is a fine one I believe
but we did not see very
much of it - James
White accompanied
us part of the way
but as he and Sally White
were going to Muckamore
he was obliged to leave
us and go back before
we had gone far -
When we returned we
found Uncle Thomas
and Aunt Elizth and
Emmy - After dinner
it being too wet to walk
