My dear Eliza
I am sorry to hear such dismal
accounts from you at Dunlavin when
things ought to be going on smooth it is very
discouraging, when they happen the contrary
poor Lucy how did she get such a heavy cold
I hope it is nothing more my Mother is to be
off in the morning. I hope she may have a fine
day, she seems very anxious to get down to
see you all, and I would be sorry any thing
should happen to prevent her we went today
to Dundrum to ask Patty would she
go with her, as I would not at all [insertion]be[/insertion] easy at
her going alone, and as cross things will
happen Patty happened to go to town having
staid at home several days expecting us
however Jane said she thought she might
promise for [underline]her[/underline], and it is fixed that my
Mother is to call for her tomorrow
morning on her way, I am sure I hope

nothing will prevent her going, it would be
very lonesome going by herself, besides not safe
for one does not know what might happen
however I hope she may find you all better
than she expects. My Aunt Gough is to be
out tomorrow evening to stay with me [deletion]till[/deletion]
while my Mother is away. Aunt Jane came
out to Eliz[underline]th[/underline] to day who is likewise lonesome
as Rich[underline]d[/underline] is nearly all the week
in town. so that is the way we are here,
I have nothing in the shape of news to tell
thee. R Shackleton dined her on first day
he brought us two fine Dahlias in his
hand which he had got from Ruth Pim
where he had been paying a visit, I heard
he was to go home to day. I forget whether
I told thee of a visit we had last first
day week from Eda Gaskin & J Gaskin the
[underline]tea[/underline] man the former is a pleasant man
the latter as dry a chip as I ever saw.
there was also another Thomas here that
day, but he came about business so thou
may guess who he was from that, he was

here two others days during the week and
had a [underline]tete a tete[/underline] with Mrs Field. I believe
her business is not quite finished yet. He
that is JH looks very well and seems cheerful
so now that I have eased thy mind on that
score let me proceed to something else, if I
have such a thing. my Aunt J, I Jacob &
[underline]Suite[/underline], Marian[deletion][/deletion] Russel, dined here on second
day, & a beautiful day it was as ever I saw
for the time of year, they all seemed to enjoy
themselves, went in before tea
On first day I went up to the yard
with the boys & R S and we all
weighed ourselves & guess mine only eight
stone five pound, I lost five since I weighed
last, so that I am not growing fat. All
ships that I put out of the nice pink are
destroyed by something or other, I suppose
slugs, I am very much provoked at it, the
Lunells brought down some splendid Dahlias
the other evening to my Mother
which they had got where they were paying
a visit, they made a great show in the
parlour when settled. I wish we could get
some good cooks. my Mother will be able

to tell thee more than I have done be
sure to write or make her write how she
got down so that we may have a letter on
seventh day night. So you got a great surprise
by Sarah popping in on you I was sorry when
I knew that you had heard nothing of her going
as I think it is not always pleasant to be taken
unawares. I believe I will say farewell as it growing
late and with dear love to J.L. & thyself
I am thy affct sister Julia
