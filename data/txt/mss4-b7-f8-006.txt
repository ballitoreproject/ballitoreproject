Dialogue 1.
A Polyphemus & Neptune
P. O Father, what things have [underline][/underline]
[underline] I suffer'd from that wicked [/underline]
[underline] guest of mine, who when he had [/underline]
[underline] made me drunk & blinded me
[underline] attacking me heavy with sleep. [/underline]
[underline] N. But who dare do that, Polyphemus. [/unclear] [/underline]
P. Indeed at first he called [/underline]
[underline] himself Nobody, but after he had [/underline]
[underline] fled , & was out of the reach of weapons [/underline]
he said his name was Ulysses.
[underline] N. I know whom thou sayest, that
Ithacan, he was sailing back from
[underline] [unclear] Troy [/unclear] but how cou'd he do that for he [/underline]
[underline] was not strong enough. P. I caught in [/underline]
my cave as I was returning from pasture
[underline] a good many fellows lying in [/underline]
[underline] wait no doubt for the cattle. But after that [/underline]
[underline] I put the stopper to the mouth of the [/underline]
[underline] cave for I have a huge stone & I kindled [insertion]a[/insertion][/deletion]

a fire having set fire to a stick which
I carried with me from the mountain
they appeared endeavouring to hide
themselves, but I took up some of them
a sit was [deletion]likely[/deletion] [insertion]fit[/insertion] beat them up [deletion]thinking[/deletion] [insertion]as if[/insertion]
they [insertion]wer[/insertion] robbers. This cunning fellow
whether Nobodyor Ulysses gave me
some strong dose mixed up indeed
it was sweet & fragrant but [insertion]most[/insertion] treacherous
& turbulent for immediately when I
drunk it all things seemed to me to turn about
& my cave itself turned about. & I was
not myself at that time but after that
I lay down to sleep, & he sharpening a
stake & putting it into the fire blinded
me from above lying down & from that time
I am blind to thee o Neptune. N. How deep
thou went asleep o Son that did not leap
up while he was blinding thee, but how
cou'd my foes get away, for I know very well
he cou'd not pull the stone from the mouth of the
[underline] cave. P. But I removed it that I might
catch him going out the more readily
& leaning down at the door & stretching
out my hands I hunted for him
letting only one sheep going out at
once into the pasture having given
charge to the ram that he ought to
do for me. N. I understand forsooth
that be hiding privily under them
escaped from them but thou ought to
call the other Cyclops against him,
[underline] P. I called them, father, & they came [/underline]
but when they asked me the plotter's
name, & I said it was Nobody thinking
me mad departed leaving me behind
So that wicked fellow cunningly [unclear][/unclear]
did me by his name but what vexed
me more was, says he, Thy Father

Neptune cannot heal thee. N
Be of good cheer for I will revenge
that he may learn that although
I cannot heal the loss
of thy sight yet as to sea affairs
I can either kill or save. He is
yet sailing.
