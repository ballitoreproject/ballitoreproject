My dear Eliza
In the
hurried
lines
I added to my mothers letter
yesterday I had not time
to tell thee much, indeed
I have not much to tell as
we have been but a short time
away, I told thee that Frank
& I went to Ballitore yesterday
to meeting, were just in time
for it, after it was over went to
Cousin Betsys I paid a little
visit every thing there just as
usual, then I went to the
mill & saw Hannah Juliot
& her son, he is a fine merry
child with his cap off & is
the picture of his father only
a pleasanter face. Hannah

looks just the same as ever
there does not seem to be the
least alteration in her, the Mill
is the same old thing but the
mill field is quite altered. George
has been cleaning out the pond
and he is building another addition
and putting up a new wheel
we were back to Dunlavin in
time for dinner, it rained a
little in the evening but not
much. to day was cloudy &
dark but not wet we took a
very pleasant drive th[insertion]r[/insertion]ough
Donard Castle=ruddery & Stratford
the country looks delightful
it is so fresh & green, we
saw at a little distance Saunders
Grove & I do not think
we could have been far from
KillRanelagh, how many
changes there have been since
the day we spent there I
hope thou wilt take care of
thyself now thou art alone
be sure write soon, perhaps thou
would have time on receipt of
this to write by Morton who
takes this note & several others
I hope we may have a good
account of you all at home
& of all those that we care
about elsewhere. did my Aunt
& Mary leave you this morning
thou wilt feel lonely enough
thou might ask Margaret to
sleep with thee if she would
be any company but perhaps
thou would rather be without
her. Wilt thou be able to
send me my hat &c. &c. by
Maurice. With love to Manliff
Arthur & thyself - I am thy affect -
Sister Selina
