My dear Debby
Need I tell that thy letter which I
received to day gave me great, pleasure, though
[deletion]it[/deletion] it was much, lessened by thy not having
as much as I expected, but it does not appear
to me (tho' thou thought it would) quite unaccountable,
like our shadows, we may run
to head on them, but never can, but I think
I caught that [unclear][/unclear] pleasure to day, I spent
it with Elizabeth, we read [insertion]Don[/insertion] Roderick, we made
our comments on it, we walked in the
garden, we went to thy bower, we were
charmed with every thing we saw, imagetion
helped us to look into futurity, where
we saw shady bowers & walks, & seats, on
which the sun shone without scorching, [insertion]on which[/insertion] the
rain fell only to cool not to wet, sometimes
it moistened the earth, to cause vegetation
to exert its powers, in fact we were delighted
with Nature, & wondered why Mankind was

so unhappy, believing not that "Man was
made to mourn" Burns's temper was too much
embittered by disappointment to be an impartial
judge, his afflictions were so often of his own
inflicting, that he felt self condemned, happily
that most unpleasant feeling to human
nature, but surely his penitence was great
& its sincerity undoubted - My dear Cozz 'tis
I hope your minds still preserves their serenity,
for nature[deletion]s[/deletion] weeps thou knows to bring
forthe the smiles from her children, of course
there is no need of participation, I hope
uneasiness for the outward does not disturb
the calmness within, - Uncertain Eben
left us this morning, so I suppose you
have him now, as I know what people
are going to say, why not what they are
going to do, I thought he could [insertion]not[/insertion] bear to stay
out the meeting at home - Poor Lissy we
are anxious to know about her
Farewell my dear [underline]little[/underline] pet
[unclear]As[/unclear] the clouds lighten
may thy heart [underline]brighten[/underline]
