	My Dear Margaret,
		I am glad once more to receive a letter from thy own hand. I wish us to be preserved thankful receivers of the many favours conferred upon us. May we be still kept in a sense of our weakness, and wretchedness, and insufficiency without Divine protection and assistance, that we may look and lean to the Lord, who is omnipotent and omnipresent, and, omnipresent, and [sic], from one season to another, cultivate an acquaintance with Him, through the means which he has allotted for that purpose, his Spirit placed in our hearts; by the operation of which petitions & offerings are prepared, and ascend with favour and acceptance to our common Creator and Benefactor, who is worthy of a whole burnt offering from each of us, even a total dedication of our all to him, from whom we have all, and by whose special goodness and mercy we yet remain, I hope, in degree alive, in every respect, to make mention with gratitude and reverence of his excellent name. ***
							R. S.
