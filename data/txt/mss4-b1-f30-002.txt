A Remarkable Dream October 30th,, 1762. n . -
I thought I was dead, & beheld my body laid like a Corps.
their seem'd to be a Person in the Appearance of a Man his 7 Raimen[insertion]t[/insertion]
somewhat of a Sheepskin or bright fawn Colour who said follow
me he Ascended a hill on the Top of wch: was a large Building
the outside Appear'd strongly built with large rough stone, I
followed my Guide into the House, but did not at first see the
Beauty of it to the full, it seemed then white & bright & a large
Company sitting, such a Number as I never beheld, the farthest
we went the Brighter it appear'd & more like the Reflection
of the sun. the first [insertion]step[/insertion] my Guide made seemed to be more than half
Way the House by what I Judged from the Appearance of the Length
of the Building on the outside; while the Guide Stop'd I look'd
at the Countenance of those I could see were very many but
cou'd not see to the farther end for the Reflection of the light wch:
Appear'd brighter than when the Sun Shines in its fullest Lustre
on a Summers Day there Appeared a Sweetness & Composure in
every Countenance far beyond what I had ever seen in any
Person while in the Body; & a lustre Reflected from the light
Extend'd to the Skirts of their Garments wch: appear'd like a
Plain Robe or Covering in one Piece that I was filled wth: Admiration;
I look'd to see if I Cou'd Distinguish Men from Women but
Cou'd not likewise If I cou'd see any one I Knew but knew non[insertion]e[/insertion]
on my first entrance into the Huse I thought I had been at Meetin[insertion]g[/insertion]
of Solid Friends I look'd to see from whence the light came but cou'd
not disc[insertion]e[/insertion]rn either Window of Opening I then Asked my Guide wh:
is this Place he Answer'd, Heaven, then I look'd to see what they
sat

sat on but cou'd [insertion]not[/insertion] discern either seats or forms, the more I look'd [unclear]y:e[/unclear] more
I admired I wanted to sit with them, but cou'd not tell how, my Guide
turn'd about to go out & looked at me to follow, but I was so much delight'd
that I was unwilling to follow him, he then beckon'd to me & said
come, we had not gone far before I stoped again, he stoped a little for
me & said again come, I follow'd, often Halting & Admiring the Pleasure
I saw in every Countenance till we got out, then the guide turn'd on the
Left Hand & we seemd to go down I did not Perceive the road we went
but coud see my Guide we soon came where I beheld a lofty Grand
arch of great wealth where we ent[insertion]e[/insertion]red into a large Room [unclear]w:ch[/unclear] I cou'd
not see to the end of till we Passed through, this Room Appeared
Grandly wainscoted & beautifully Painted with different colours the
first sight of this beautiful room abated my sorrow which was very
great, while we came down the Descent, for leaving the other I had
but just time to take a view of this fine Place before a Numbred of
Person Richly dressed Passed us who smell'd so strong of Brimstone
that I seem'd almost sufficated, all of them were talking to themselves
& before the came meat looked well but when they came there
Appeared a Blackness in every face those that did [insertion]not[/insertion] talk loud mov'd
their lips & seem'd to Matter [unclear]w:ch[/unclear] was also the manner of some who walk
alone I was seised with horror I ask'd my guide what is this Place
And what are these, he answer'd these are Miserable for ever they
were when in the Body in tumults & will be so Everlastingly, at some
distance sat an old Gentlewoman in a Chair like a bath Chair a fine
Person very White [unclear]or[/unclear] Powder'd & grandly drss'd I made up to her to [unclear]see[/unclear]
if there was the same Appearance of misery in her & was more [unclear]shock'd[/unclear]
than before her lips were moving & from her Eyelids came small
flames of fire; & Immediately after this as (I looked Round) there
Appeared in my view a woman Friend Mainly dress'd in a green [unclear]apro[/unclear]
& I Remember'd when I was young I often took notice of her for the [unclear]solide[/unclear]
of her Deportment Particularly in Meetings I eagerly made up to
her & said what what art thou amongst the Miserable, tell me
what brought thee hither, she wept & said no wrong that I have
done Between Man & Man but but unfaithfulness & disobeydiance to
my

my God brought me hither, I thought I wept much as well as she
when I first look'd on her, she look'd sorrowful I then turn'd to my
Guide & said let me go, he walked Slowly on & we met so many in
Appearance & Smell that I seemed almost sufficated with Brimstone,
I then in great Bitterness of spirit said tell me am I to [unclear]rem:n[/unclear]
here for ever; I thought a little Pass'd if I had died I had secur'd an
Inheritance Among'st the first (we saw) my guide stop'd & looking
[unclear][/unclear] at me said thou art not to Remain here but to return to the
World again; if thou art faithful to My God thou May'st have an
Inheritance Among'st the first we saw, but I have some thing else
to Show thee, he went a little farther where Appear'd another Arch
Which divid'd this Place from a larger one like a Chappel wherein
Abundance of People were Assembled to Worship & saying amen, [unclear]lord[/unclear]
have Mercy upon us Christ have Mercy upon us, these Appear'd
More Plain in Dress & look'd Whiter, I said to my Guide these are not
Miserable too, he said these are Miserable these are they that thought
to be sav'd by a Profession of Religion, but had not on the White
Robes of Rigteousness they all came in by this room some stopt
Among'st the Worshipers other went on to those who smell'd so strong
of Brimstone; my distress was now greater than before for I thought
I knew many of these who also look'd as if the knew me & thought
they Appear'd as if the Worship'd they lookd to & fro & seemd much
Decompos'd I again entreat'd my Guide to let me go, he walk'd gently
out of this Place & came into the entrance of this House w:ch is
Wide with a large gate Here stood a Number in black or dark Cloaths
Who did not seem to move forward to the Others, when we came to
the outside of the gate, I saw an Intimate Friend whom I much lov'd
Coming towards the Gate & two Persons Conducting him [insertion]he[/insertion] look'd
Sorrowful on me & I on him I ask'd him art thou going among'st
the Miserable, what is thy offence, what has thou done, tell me
He Answered beware of [unclear]Covetunep[/unclear] & the love of Money that
Brought me Hether we both wept much & were greatly Troubled,
but I want'd to be gone & follow'd my Guide, & on looking back
Saw some Pulling others Pushing him, we were now in a large
[unclear]Enelos'd[/unclear] field In this field I saw many Persons some of whom
are

are since dead, out of which I cou'd see no road my Guide lead me to
a Place where there was but Just Room to go out he stood & look'd at
me Earnestly said thou art going into the World again Remember
What thou hast now seen 'tis not enough to be honest to man thou
Must be Honest & faithful to thy God also on this the thoughts of
Returning into the World again Affected me much for it seem'd a matter
of doubt whether I should be able to steer my course so as to be
Deem'd worthy of Admitance among'st the first I had a sight of,
but standing Speechless & my Guide standing still Faith suddenly
Sprang up in my Mind & seem'd to say these words Lord thou canot
if thou wilt Presence me through all, then I awak'd but the Horror
Distress I felt on my Mind, I am not Capable of Expressing, I
seem'd as if I fetch'd my Breadth in a room where Brimstone &
Sulpher was burning often saying to my Nurse & those about me
I seemed as if the smell of Brimstone was in my stomack and I
Realy thought I cou'd not live many Hours nor do I belive I shou'd if
the Almighty in the Extendings of his boundness goodness had not
had regard to me a Poor unworthy Creature, I caus'd that Sufficating
Smell to Pass from me & give me to trust in his Name, that [unclear]melt'd[/unclear]
my spirit into Contrition before him, and Enabl'd me to vent my
Sorrows in many tears, after Which my Troubl'd mind was favour'd
With a Calm.
