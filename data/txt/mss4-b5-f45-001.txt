Mrs. Leadbeater,
What Tommy Dayle said
with respect. to some of my employers
objecting to the Lancasterian
plan was true, but their objections
would in a little time be
entirely done away if I had the
means to follow up the plan
as they would then see the rapid
improvement their Children would
make, but it is not in my power
to pay Monitors and give them
also their Education free. however
my own two little Boys. teaches
the Children their letters on the
sand Table, which takes part of
[unclear]the[/unclear]

the Burthen of me, for what Scholars
I have an all small except two
Boys at Bookkeeping four Boys
and four Girls at Arithmetick -
Where I advertised under the
Patronage of You and Lady
Trench the Publick were informed
of what my Wife could teach, but
to no purpose, however gloomy
my Prospects are at present, I hope
by my own industry, if I could
meet a little encouragement after
a very short time I would do pretty
well, You would much oblige
me by letting me see the letter
Tommy Doyle handed you at
his return from Ballibarney
Yours most respectfully
Sunday 29th May
Micl.. Dunn
