49 Nassau St Oct 11th 1827
Dear Cousin,
I think I have acquitted my self of all
my Country-Commissions excepting the intelligence respecting
the trays which I now forward lest they might travel
here Post-haste - I have made inquiry of Robt McKean
and of the others & I am told that they could not be japanned
in Dublin - moreover that the satisfaction would never
equal the expense as new ones would not cost much more
than you would be charged - I delivered the small
parcel from Thos Barrington punctually the evening I
arrived - his nephew was not in town - so I had
to leave it at the shop - I am endeavouring to overtake
my business so that there is not much respite allowed
me - I beg you may make my cordial salutation
acceptable to all inquiring friends, I shall not readily
forget the kind treatment I experienced in all quarters
I hope Cousin Sarah has had no more attacks of the
weakness she complained. It is not worth turning the corner
to say I am yours affectionately William Rayner

A night cap of Richards found its way into
my valise & a strange neck cloth instead of
1 of mine - they can be returned when
an opportunity may offer
