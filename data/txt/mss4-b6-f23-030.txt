Seeks not to wipe her tears away

ML Ballytore
O [unclear]Wrightson[/unclear], memory still can trace
The lines of thy expressive face,
While at thy knee in duteous mood
Thy little Mary listening stood
Imbibing precepts which inclin'd
To love of truth the tender mind
On thy relaxing brow the while
Gazing to catch the expected smile
And seize the time which suited best
To urge the infantile request

Thrice seven times has the wintry blast
Along the Golden Valley past
And on fair Suir's luxuriant side
His trees have waved in summer's pride
Since last my wondering eyes I rais'd
And on great Slieve-na-manna gaz'd
While, bold & bare, his lordly brow
Scowl'd on the laughing plains below,
Since last their glances loved to rest
On gentle Suir's transparent breast,
Where blooming beautiful & bright
Again the landskip [deletion]charms[/deletion] [insertion]meets[/insertion] the sight
And downward in the watry plain
The cultur'd mountain charms again
The loaded cart, the labouring hind
Around his ample bosom wind
Oh scenes belov'd, I feel your power,
Sweet records of the vanish'd hour
When with light heart, & cheerful eye
I hail'd these waters gliding by
But time's swift wing has swept away
The joys of youth, the visions gay.
His influence spreads o'er all my frame,
Yet has he left my heart the same
Has left me friends as warm, as true,
As when our lives & loves were new.
Again my pensive steps they join
[deletion]And[/deletion] Again they mix their sighs with mine
Pilgrims, with silent step we tread
The enclosure here repose the dead
While Evening gilds with sober smile
The venerable gothic pile
Though branching Elms surrounding screen.
Of spreading foliage shades the scene,
We pass the tombs ascending high
Graced with the pomp of ancestry
Beside this grave our steps are staid
Where not a stone records the dead,
Where grass & weeds unheeded wave
Scarce noticed now the Stranger's grave
The willows on the Islets side
Kiss their soft shadows in the tide
