My dear E - The Reflector is come out & thy
piece appears in the beginning Selina guess'd
its author at once, as usual you charged
Hugh well with letters, he pull'd out a great
packet to get ours from amongst them, he
gave a good account of you all, I suppose
you look very fair by this time, I will try
to send the Linen by Eben's man, & for the bed I am
very much obliged but I will be afraid to send
you commissions if they are to be executed in
this way, will it want a new tick? I dont remember
it, Tell M Doyle I'm obliged to her for thinking of me
I intend to try N Wright, What sewing would I not give
thee now if thou wert here! I dreamt I was at
home last night & saw all the attention in my mothers
room & saw my bedstead leaning against the
Oak chest of draws, could my mother spare me a little
wee bit of [unclear]rotton[/unclear] stone & a little bale of yarn, now
for fear thou'd think me too good a dreamer
I will own that my mother told me all about her
room &c, tell my mother both her inks look
very well, Meg bears travelling,
I went to see W Downes yesterday, she told me
in passing by the Lefanu's house she saw bridal
folk at the door & a Coach, so I concluded that
M A Creighton was married; I saw Jane at a

distance yesterday, she did not see me, did
you send letters to me by Mt. Melick, how
glad I shall be when the yearly meeting draws
near, Edw will try to get the sharings for thee &
will send a small wicker to my mother that
she may have no alloy in her candle-making
Surely I need not send dear love to you all, did
M White get out yet & how are Thos Henry & the gay
little girls? thy SB I make this signature quite
naturally
