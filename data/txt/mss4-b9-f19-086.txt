26th- of 11th mo. 1824
My dear E --- I'm afraid thou'rt vex'd with me
for not sending home your baskets bags & crocks
in due time, the last caravan took the two
little crocks & a basket belonging to Mary T also
some muslin which my mother order'd 2 1/2 yards
at at 1/-s per yd & a pillow case mark'd Â£-12 which
I thought I had sent long ago but found it the
other day among my own --- I was delighted
to hear [insertion]from[/insertion] my Mother's own hand that she was
so much better I am afraid her illness was
brought on by her visit to us & this idea made
me extremely uneasy I could not help blaming myself
for pressing her to come, just for [deletion]my[/deletion][insertion]our[/insertion] own [unclear][/unclear]
[unclear][/unclear] Jane Malone has a fresh trial to bear, [unclear][/unclear]
Jane is extremely ill in a fever, the Doctor, Gamble, call'd
to day to say he had no hopes of her, she was seized
with a convulsive fit this morning & when this recurs
he says he never K[insertion]n[/insertion]ew a patient to recover
I seem to have nothing but dull news to communicate,
I was surprized to see F Johnson's
shop shut to day & on calling found that it
was on account of his mother's death which took
place on the 24th after a week's alarming illness
she had been complaining for some time
but no danger of her death [deletion]she[/deletion] was apprehended
till the last week Debby says her sufferings
were distressing the last day but the close
seem'd quiet & easy --- Frank is much
troubled -- the widow Johnson's shop was also shut

for him & a well air'd bed - Magt has cut another
tooth the only one since she was in Ballitore she is
still rather peevish, John is getting thro' the cowpoc
he is subject to a complaint in his bowels which
keeps him very thin, I heard from Lydia lately she
is in good spirits her boy getting teeth without much
trouble give my dear love to my mother & tell her I
will attend to her commissions I hope you got the things I sent
when shall we see my father has he nothing to do in Dublin
Answered

surely the groceries must
soon be out, he ought to
come & renew them
ever thy SB
dear love to my aunt Sally
give my love to Mary
till I hope to answer
her question by the next
op: -
excuse me sending
this by post
5 Elizth Leadbeater
Ballitore
to buy D S. a good cow or a
Kerry near calving, 2 small bowls
wooden bowls, 1 dozen besoms,
straw baskets, 2 chip potato
baskets, long crocks & small
crocks, flat crocks
I will keep this open as long as I can to give a
further account of J Malone: her poor mother
who feels so exquisitely is greatly to be pitied
The accounts from F Bewley are so discouraging
that I'm afraid I shall never see her again &
it seems a very long time since I had
even a line from thee, no better account
of J Malone, hast thou been at Moone lately?
tell Eben that Edw would be very glad to see
him tomorrow evening we shall have dinner ready for
