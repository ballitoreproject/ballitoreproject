My dear Lucy
Thou may see by the date that I
am at home where I arriv[unclear]ed[/unclear] safe to tea
last night Thomas told thee [unclear]of our stay[/unclear] at Kilcullen
so I need not mention it but [unclear]I had[/unclear] hardly left
him when I wished myself [unclear]back[/unclear] in the gig. the
rain very shortly commenced & before we got to
Naas it was raining torrents, [unclear]the guard[/unclear] asked
me would I go inside, [deletion]but[/deletion] [unclear]I asked[/unclear] him the
fare but he took care he would not tell
me till he got me in, I was afraid to stay
outside in such a pour of wet lest my Mother
would be angry with me, but was very sorry I
did not as it was so close inside that I was
nearly smothered, how often did I wish that
I was going back to Dunlavin to wait for the caravan
in the morning, but it is al over now.
the fare was seven shillings & a shilling to the
guard & coach man. & besides that he broke the
top off my parasol, so it cost me nine to get to

town, I tell thee this Frank that thou may
be on thy [unclear]guard[/unclear] and not put any one else
in that coach but we did it for the best, and as
I got safe it [unclear]is[/unclear] not worth fretting about. I was
landed safe [unclear][/unclear] S Gambles door where Sar[unclear]ah[/unclear]
received [insertion]me[/insertion] & [unclear][/unclear] Maurice was waiting to see
whether I would come, he went to tell my
Mother that I was & to bring her and the
car over, so I went up stairs to Emma who received
me very [unclear]fondly[/unclear] & I got my dinner which
was very [unclear]acceptable[/unclear] & consisted of partridge [unclear]wh[/unclear]
Sam said [unclear][/unclear] running about the Tipperary
hills a few days ago. Emma was asking very
particularly about thee, said she had not known
thou wert in town, I saw little Johanna, who is
very stout, she is bigger & older looking than Fanny but
not at all so lady like, I had only just time to finish
my dinner before the car came with my Mother
& Arthur so I had to decamp it was dark night [insertion]before we got out[/insertion] &
I thought the road home never appeared so long.
I told my Mother how sorry I was that I did not
wait till morning, but perhaps it is as well as it is.
Elizabeth came in the two horse coach & there
was plenty of room for me. Arthur could get no

[insertion]seat at[/insertion] [deletion]seat[/deletion] Kilcullen but had to walk to [unclear][/unclear] as I was not
home till seven. he does not know what bewitched
him not to go early. It is time [unclear][/unclear] my dear
Francis & Lucy to thank you for all [unclear][/unclear] kindness
to me while with you which [unclear][/unclear] very [unclear]mu[/unclear]
and wish I could return, the be[unclear][/unclear] is for [unclear][/unclear]
[unclear]to act[/unclear] so as to try to merit your [unclear][/unclear]d, as I believe
there are few things we p[unclear][/unclear] to b[unclear]e[/unclear]
loved by those we love. I felt [unclear][/unclear] sorry this
morning when I awoke not to [unclear][/unclear] myself [unclear][/unclear]
the comfortable bed but Emmy [unclear][/unclear] almost
mediately calling me to get up, she [unclear][/unclear] very
well & looks I think rather better, [unclear][/unclear] she did
in Dunlavin. Francis I gave thy little packet
safe into thy Mother's hands, so that [unclear][/unclear] off my mind
I hope thou wilt mind what I [unclear]said[/unclear] about writing
me a line now & then & despatching it to me when
the sheet is full if it [insertion]were[/insertion] ever so little at a time still
it will be pleasant to me to hear of [underline]you[/underline] & of
Lucy's [underline]little means[/underline], which I hope may soon loose
that name & be converted into [underline]large means[/underline]. I will
feel very lonesome here now without the shop. I
found no alteration since I left this save the year
looks older & that winter is showing its approaches
Manliff had as pleasant a face as ever & seems in good
spirits he looks well. Eliza too seems after her best fashion
[underline]who am I to thank for that[/underline]

I have almost got to the end of my paper & perhaps
you will [unclear][/unclear] think that is is time for me to stop
but my [unclear][/unclear] full & you must excuse me, for it
 [unclear][/unclear]ust [insertion]hav[/insertion] ve [unclear][/unclear] me where. This is a beautiful morning
[unclear][/unclear] if it [unclear]wa[/unclear] welcome me home, & sure I ought to
[unclear][/unclear] m[unclear][/unclear] I have it, it is sometimes, I believe
very gener[unclear][/unclear] case, that it is not untill after we
lose the blessings we have that we know their true
value, & it sometimes requires bitter experience to
teach us. My Mother I think looks very
well, her visit to you did her a great deal of good,
 & I made Eliza smile at my gaining a pound a w[unclear][/unclear]

I gave Manliff such an account of [unclear]Lugnaquilla[/unclear] that he says
he must go up too, as for me I think I never will forget it. I got
my handkerchief so Francis thou need not tell Lucy to look
for it. if I left any thing behind me please send it up by Morton
& my Mother says not to forget the butter & now
with dear love to you both, I wishing you as well as it is
good for you to be, believe me your very affect sister Selina
this letter begins with thee Lucy but it ends with [underline]you both[/underline]
Eliza desires her love and bid me tell thee that she was not in
town since but that Aunt [unclear][/unclear]
four & sixpence but that thy [unclear][/unclear] his [unclear][/unclear] shilling [unclear][/unclear]
for that price and she also says that thou did not tell her
whether nurse was paid Johnny the car hire & to send
her word whether or not she did
