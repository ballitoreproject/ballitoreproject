My dear Elizth
I thought thou would have been
uneasy about thy bag & was quite sorry to find
my father could not take it, however is goes
now - I send Â£1/21d/2 Deborah will give thee
the remainder of 4/2 for my [unclear]boster[/unclear] for which
I am much obliged, I fear I am very troublesome
to thee, my clothes were very nicely done up
I was thinking thou gave Biddy great charges about
them, I have none to send at present, our clothes
are taken to the Glen every week to be wash'd,
The meeting is not far off now I hope my
mother will be peruaded to come, I have
not got my aunts shawl yet, but intend doing
so to day & having it ready for her to send by
the meeting folk if she should not come
herself, A Fayle is gone to Dunleavy & has set
her house at Rathmines for 6 months during

which time [unclear][/unclear] & Charlotte are to stay in
England, she is to be at Joshua's during
the meeting at least so I hear
My aunt Wright is rather better but still
extremely weak & ill, J Stephens the same
way, Jane Malone recover'd, we are to go
to her house tomorrow evening
ever thine S Barrington
