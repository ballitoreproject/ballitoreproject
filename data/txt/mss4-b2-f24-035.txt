My dear Father,


        It seems long since I was favoured with a letter from thee, I suppose thou did not hear that we returned from Limerick in time for meeting first day morning, left it the preceding day, lodged at Joshua Fennels that night, we got there 2nd instant & lodged at Thomas Marks, he & his wife were only got home themselves the evening before, we had hope to have met E: Hatton there, but understood their family visit commenced at said time, Thomas Taverner was inclined to accompany us, but was prevented by illness, having got cold (was supposed) which affected his head & eye: so that we had not his company except in two families first day evening, poor old Walter Rest on his crutches was all the company we had, he mostly joined us: as to the service, as far as I could feel, or judge, our dear friend M: Dudley was favoured with life & authority to minister to the states of families, but it was hard work, the life of religion is so exceedingly depressed in their hearts, that there appears little room for the Master, & no wonder it should be so with the servant, as for my part I mostly felt Naked & poor, I thought in some degree of suffering, searching & proving how I came there, but I considered that she (who had the weight laid on her) could hardly have gone if I had declined going; it would have been too much without some sympathizing Companion, & as there did not appear any other at present to offer, it might not have been amiss for me to answer the purpose of attending her. It was a trying exercising time to me, I think I may say a humiliating time: as soon as we got thro we hasted home, being very desirable to us, we found our families pretty well, my little Eliza seemed to have got some cold, her eye worse, & a little cough. During my absense [sic] Joshua Strangman had made application to my Mother for her daughter Becky for his Son Joseph, a religion sober youth, he is here now applying for himself, it is rather soon to say how he will succeed, but (between ourselves) I dont [sic] think he is disagreeable to sister: he has it seems 1000 in a good business, & his Father is to settle 100 a year on him, to inherit after his decease.
        I had a kind letter from sister Sally (Robert), dated from Minehead, she said, they had some thought of being at the Circular meeting at Gloucester, where they have some little expectation of being met by C: Hustler, tho nothing decisive respecting it appears: if C: H: should come & join Rebecca sister [word crossed out] thinks she might be released, her words are I know she will not suffer thereby, & a little relaxation from the present arduous line of service is very desirable to me. She also mentions the surprise William Matthews appearance gave them at Milverton a ^few^ days before she wrote me, as they thought he had been floating on the unstable Element, last Circular meeting at Gloucester he attended, without uttering a sentence in meetings, which he purposed to attend this year: she had not heard lately from York, but the last accounts were agreeable.
        I hope soon to be favoured with a letter from thee, & say in particular how our dear Mother is, also sister Lydia & the Children, I hope Nanny is pretty well, Anne desires her love to her, also please to give her duty to her Grandmother, & accept of it thyself.
        My Husband joins in dear love thy affectionate
                Margaret Grubb
