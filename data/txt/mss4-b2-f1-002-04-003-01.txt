My dear James, 
I received thine on my return from our Quarterly meeting at Edenderry - [*omit written perpendicular on side of page; outlined the following lines in pencil with star] The publick meetings of worship there were silent; thought [sic] Edith Lovell of Bristol & Sarah Newland were present - Only that on First day - - & - - gave us a sample of their ware. The elders conferred about it, hoped, hesitated, doubted, & at last concluded not to meddle for a while longer. [pencil note X] [pencil note line down side of the margin with omit] However weak & light & fallible we may be of that class, yet I think it is a favour that we seem to be preserved from prejudice & partiality, and that love & tenderness prevail as becomes brethren - My poor spirit was [pg number] 203 much low down in the deeps in the meetings of worship, & I think our select meetings were not barren of edification, but to me our meetings of discipline feel flat, flat. I want a current of life to bear our discipline along, then we should feel as joints & sinews to one another, then we should be united as fellow-labourers, a bundle of love, and these seasons would be seasons of Divine refreshment and renewal of strength. But we are too outward, too superficial in the general: there is not a keeping enough in these meetings to an inward attention, & some (it is to be feared) handle some part of the discipline with unwashen hands.                 
8th I wrote the  ++ The world seems at times a great vacuum. Ye that keep a spiritual diary, when ye turn back the leaves of your lives does not the state of the account frighten you? Perhaps that practice is an incentive to care and diligence: as a man who keeps an account of his daily expenses is apt thereby to learn to practice frugality and economy.
