Clonmel 15th of 4th month 1780

My dear Father,
	This morning I received thy kind & very acceptable letter: the most interesting subject it contains has occupied my thoughts mostly since, & I own it strikes me in an agreeable manner, as if it might be in the ordering of that Providence, who has kindly guided our predecessors, & I trust his mercy is not departed from us. I wish my dear sister may be enabled to determine wisely I know for my part I have nothing in my mind against the union, as I sincer^e^ly value & esteem Cousin Tommy, believing him to possess many excellent qualifications, & an honest sincere Heart. I sympathize with my sister on the weightiness of the subject under her contemplation, but believe (if its [sic] right, as I hope it is) the way will be made easy to her. My Husband is quite of my sentiments about this important affair, & rather wishes Tommy may be successful. I hope I shall soon hear from thee again, as I cannot but be anxious about my sister. My dear love I desire to her, ^I think^ she shall have my ardent, warmest wishes for her being helped in this affair, with the best help
	I wrote to thee last 4th day, & sent ^it^ by 5th nights [sic] post, which letter I hope thou hast received. I said then, that my Samuel was from home, he came to me that evening well & hearty as usual, a great favour, I want him to go to Dublin, as I think he might very well, but he does not seem inclined to go, yet I hope he will, for I am not apprehensive of being confined sooner than about the 18th
	My children are bravely thro mercy, but Abram very bold, & not at all under proper subjection, but continues to gabble nonsense as when thou wert here, & I am loath to be sever, as he has been so delicate & hard to rear, but I hope in a little ^time^ (if he be spared to me) to have him better order: he is not sturdy nor sullen in his temper, & remarkably affectionate if he perceived [sic] me troubled, wanting to diverst [sic] me, & make me well with his play-things, calling to Susy to come & see poor Mama, which creates the more tenderness in me to him.
	I do not find I have matter worth enlarging on at present, as I wrote so lately, nothing new I think has occurred: little Sally John much the same way, tho they think she rather gains ground.
	My duty (joined by My Husbands) & dear ^love^ attends you as due, from your affectionate daughter
	Margaret Grubb
