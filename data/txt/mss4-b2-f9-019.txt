My dear Cousin,                                                 Ballitore: 28/6 month 1777.
		I am indebted to thine of 9th & 18th instant, gratefully acknowledge thy Remittance of 21.18.4 which with the cost of the piece of lawn 1.19.7 makes 23.17.11, which exceeds the Balance of my Account furnished 11.18.4  added to the Interest-money 12 making together 23.18.4 , by five pence halfs, which I give to thy son for pocket-money.
	Thy son continues (through Divine mercy) well & hearty, hopeful & agreeable, & I trust our care of him is wanting in no respects. My Son is now (I suppose) at the Province Meeting of Wicklow, where (I expect) are also Mabel Wigham, Elizabeth Robinson, & divers servants: Aby has got what is called the muffles: Lydia wrote to his sister Debby about ten days ago so explicit a declaration against his suit, that we thought it most proper to desist, not having a wish to constrain, or over-persuade. From the manner in which my son seemed to have conceived this thing, & the best sense which my poor mind could come at, I thought it was right; & therefore concurred assiduously with his endeavours; but since we have not been instrumental to inspire a reciprocal liking, we make a fair & honourable, & I hope a safe Retreat: for I am of sentiment that this affair will not hurt this dear young man (I may say to thee a fine & promising plant, which I humbly hope will grow to be a Tree of Righteousness), but has rather been a blessing to him in the humiliation, mortification, designation & Patience which it has taught him. Poor dear Lydia is also (I think much more) to be pitied, I doubt not but her conflicts are grievous, a cloud seems at present to impend: I know not well what it is big with. Eben (I suppose) much as usual, better & worse. As to other matrimonial intelligence, it looks like a cloudy season in other places too. John Conran lately left us for Dublin on his return from Mountmelick. Louisa (I understand) sees nothing about it, & is not for taking a leap in the dark: so that matter is at present suspended. I have no direct intelligence from Tanners end about their affairs; but I suppose Amby is rejected by Sally, nevertheless was determined to out-stay John Grubb there; so John returned home, I believe means to make one more effort when the coast will be clear, but quite uncertain is his success. James Abell has asked for her sister Betty, I do not hear whether he will prevail or not: but people think he will. ^Robert Dudley about being married if not already so.^ The account which John Grubb gives me of their Peril by sea is as follows, writing of himself & companions Elizabeth Robinson & T: Wily he says, We had a fine passage as to Time, but were a little alarmed, being several hours on First-day by a large vessel, 3 to 400 Tuns, with 18 guns & about 40 men (blacks, yellows & whites:) we were boarded by some of the men, & were told it was a Letter of Marque belonging to Liverpool, going to Africa, but from the shape of the ship & the frightful-looking Crew of Negroes, Indians, & the worst of our own race, the Captain & several of our sailors were of opinion it was an American Privateer; & that on their seeing our Cargo to be Coal, did not think it a prize worth their notice: so they parted us quietly. Our friends landed near Cork 9th instant. We have been much alarmed by a feverish complaint which our dear Peggy Grubb was seized with 15th instant, by accounts the disorder was violent while it held, & left her very weak, but I trust (through mercy) it has left her: they were obliged to provide a Nurse for the child; so she must forego that gratification I suppose: however, the little one thrives bravely. A Doctor attended closely, & no care of affectionate Relations I believe was wanting. We are in some expectation that Sister Carleton, Sally & Betty Shannon will set off on their intended visit to Clonmel the latter end of next week. The Lawn which thou mentions bespoke by Sister Carleton was for aprons for my Girls. My wife desires thou will send such a piece as the last, & place to my Account. We are generally favoured with tolerable health, my wife now & then but just middling: but gets out among the workmen, which is her delight. Sister Carleton walks pretty fast for a spurt, then sits down, fixes her leg up & says, Lord, help me! As usual. We expect her to dine with us to day. Doubtless thou hears from Abby that they are bravely there & that thy Mother is at Derrygarran. As Peggy has got so long a furlough, we expect she will spend more time with us here. We are pleased to understand that Hannahs complaint in her stomach is better ^& the rest of you pretty well.^ I note what thou says of Mabel Wigham, she is a near & dear friend to us, past a few days here to our comfort & edification Sally Beale thought proper to resign her seat to Molly Greer, who was here with Mabel. I rather hope the Excursion will prove of advantage to the young woman: perhaps her Father might feel it so, & be the more earnest to have her join that Chariot. I hear that John Storer, John Townsend & Thomas Corbyn with one or two more seem likely to pay us a visit, but as to the time when, I dont remember to have heard much to be depended on further than thy letter mentions. I correspond little with Samuel Neale, still less with Thomas Greer, I know not what the former may have in his mind respecting your Province: perhaps ye may know it yourselves in the fullness of time. They are both valuable Friends, seasoned & sanctified vessels, & often made use of by him who knows the heart. They may have their foibles and frailties as men, but my connection with them being only in a Religious capacity, I love & think well of them in that line for the most part, & leave the rest to them whom it may more immediately concern. Indeed I fear there is not that kindly drawing together which ought to be, & when opportunity has offered I hope I have not been backward to speak my poor sentiments. I wish they were better worth attending to: then perhaps there would be more attention paid to them. I am pleased to find that at last there are some hopes that thou mayst be good for something. If thou be an obedient, humble child, glad to be honoured with the least & lowest employ^ment^ about the Great-house, whatever little thing thy hand finds to do, doing it with all thy might, sedulous to approve thy self an honest faithful servant of the Church, & solicitous only to obtain the Masters condescending Regard & notice, thou may be favoured to get as much of the fragments which fall from the tables of the rich, as may keep thy life & soul together: and this (be it known to thee) is all that I aspire at for myself. I had like to have forgot to let thee know that since my last, Robert Lecky, Jane Watson (Rathrush), my wife & I were out (by appointment of our Meetings of discipline) to visit the families of our friends. We went pretty fully through those of Killconner & Newtown Meetings, & were helped beyond my expectation. We were at Killconner at the Marriage of William Walpole with Jenny Lecky, poor girl, I hope she has gone among honest, simple people, who will use her tenderly. The wedding-festival was at Robert Leckys: a large company, pretty well conducted: I think no sign yet of his spirits going down. We had a baptizing season in his family. Jane Watson was not with us at that opportunity. Poor sister Fuller ill in the Gout, her brother Thomas also had an attack of it lately for the first time I suppose. William Duckett better (I hope) every way. We expect my nieces (Fuller) soon from England. Probably some of that Caravan may come by Donaghadee. Harry Ridgway gone that way to meet, or look after his wife, who is one of it. All our dear love attends, you all ^including Jenny^. I am my dear Debby, thy truly affectionate Friend & kinsman
Richard Shackleton
