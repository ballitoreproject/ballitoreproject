We have lovely weather still

the benefit of several heavy
showers. Bally man for instance.

wish I was with you.

Love to Uncle Dr Henry [unclear]Catharine[/unclear]

I remember all the old places
you mention well. I quite take
an interest in hearing about
them. & The French - they are such
nice people so different from the
[unclear]Dirty[/unclear] Irish; I hope Dr Henry wont be
in a hurry to leave you, so you
are in my poor old room, I can
imagine you now, I feel "at home"

My dear Friend
Emily has just been here
& read me part of thy letter, I felt very much
disappointed on hearing that mine, posted
I think last monday had not reached thee perhaps
ere now it may, I do hope it has, it
must seem so long without any direct news
from home, I may still give a good act.
all is going on well, servants most agreeable
& as far as I can [deletion]tell[/deletion] see regularly attending to their
business. Honor bids me say the Indian meal has not
been sent & that she must get another stone this [unclear]eving[/unclear]
she takes good care of the fowl &c. yesterday & today are
just days in the kitchen but Honor does not choos the
fowl shd. follow their example, I sent 3 doz. [insertion]eggs[/insertion] [deletion][/deletion],
yesterday the Unthanks are going to give up business
but with the eggs to be sent still, (to [unclear]Glenare[/unclear]
gay in future) Birds & plants look well & flourishing
with the exception of the scarlet Geraniums in the parlour
window which begin to look withering. The weather continues
very lovely I have not had any fire since the
day after you left & never felt the need, of course a
good bright one shall greet your return home. I sent
the papers regularly until [unclear]desired[/unclear] not - now again
they shall be forwarded. 2 go by this post. I will
write again as I have not room. affectionately MB
