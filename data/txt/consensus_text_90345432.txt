him.
5 Wednesday. Nothing worth recording,
except that I went with Emmy to
Eustace St, found poor Aunt Cole
in bed with a cold and in close
confab with Aunt Liddy who looked
pretty well and invited Charlie and
me to go out to tea. As I felt as if
I were an intruder I curtailed my
visit and returned with Emmy
who left me at about 3 for the
train to Carrickmines
Charlie had set off yesterday on a little
excursion with J Perry jr and [deletion][/deletion] made
his appearance at about dinner time.
While drawing in the evening I was
agreeably surprised by a visit from
Isabel Shackleton accompanied by her cousin
Mary Holland. We did not go to Aunt & L's
6 Thursday. Who should call to see me
to day but Emily Chandlee with an
invitation to tea, but we did not go
as [deletion]Uncle[/deletion] Florence and Emmy
called and took tea with us.
