25th.. Tuesday- A a gloomy cold
day - The boys vanished after breakfast
and did not appear until evening.
They went off to amuse themselves.
Ned and I took an unusual walk
Indeed the days are spent so
much in the same way now that
I think I shall henceforth only note
down any little event that occurs
out of the common - I heard from
Papa this morning - also from
Polly who says baby is growing
unbecomingly fat and has small
eyes and plenty of hair -
They were expecting Mary White
to spend a week - Liddy Dawson's
little son is I hear a very fine
child.
26th. Wednesday - Fine but rather
cold - Three letters this morning,
one from Margt one from Fassaroe,
and one from Sally Barrington
Pretty well - [underline]P.[/underline]
