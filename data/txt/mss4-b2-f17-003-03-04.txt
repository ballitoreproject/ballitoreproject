From the same to the same

My dear friend,
We are kept pretty constantly informed advised about thy state by those who know we are very nearly interested in thy welfare: & understand^ing^ that thou art tolerably recruited after the late trial peculiar to those of thy sex whose lot it is to replenish the earth, I suddenly took a thought to scribble a few lines to thee, which might express something of the warm & lively affection which my wife & I (& I believe all mine) sincerely bear thee. I am glad that thou art raised again on thy feet, & I trust thy head is lifted up above the waters of distress & despondency, which sometimes overwhelms like a flood. Why it hath pleased all wise Providence that thy outward & inward frame should be of such delicate texture, & that thou shouldst so often be brought low in body & mind, afflicted & pained beyond many others is among the secret things, which it belongs not to us to investigate  but no doubt he, whose thou art; by creation & adoption, knows that such a conduct towards thee is necessary for thee altogether, for thy preservation, establishment, purification, refinement, humiliation & preparation for an increase & further fruitfulness of spirit. As was said to the mother of our Lord, the begotten of the Father, yea, a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also, that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed  So it is requisite for those, whose souls are impregnated & made prolifick by the Divine Spirit, repeatedly to witness that Sword, that Word, that fiery Law to do its office  that so the vessel may be made clean, & kept clean fit to contain & to transmit in unadulterated purity the precious odours & sweet increase, which it may be honoured to convey. And the more simple & single, & weak & foolish, & the less of the creaturely will & wisdom any have about them, the greater will be the excellence of the power. Being sensible of this I am not for exalting the creature - & dearly loving my friends I would be exceeding sorrowful to hurt them  but without doing either I hope I may just say that I feel earnestly concerned for thy steadfastness & solid happiness, not only an account of the friendship & intimacy which subsist between us  but in a peculiar manner for the sake of that holy thing, that talent, which the Author of every good & perfect gift has seen most to dispense to thee, for the edification of his church, & the comfort & encouragement of the faithful among his people. May it continue to increase in beauty & lustre brightened by frequent use, preserving undiminished its intrinsick value & currency! And I not only hope & desire, but I believe my beloved friend, that this will be the case with thee; & that he who loved, called & chose thee out of the world will be ever near to help & support thee, & that thou wilt now & everlastingly experience that having loved his own, which were in the world, he loved them ^un^to the end.
+ + + I am apprehensive they had no high tides of best favour at the province meeting at Cork. I suppose the humble, devoted servants & faithful labourers were owned & met with their secret encouragement  but as to the extension of divine true regard in the general, they may speak who attended there. Perhaps they might say, as I often say in my own mind in religious assemblies, Now hath the Lord covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger! + + +
I am, my dear friend, ever
affectionately thine
Richard Shackleton
