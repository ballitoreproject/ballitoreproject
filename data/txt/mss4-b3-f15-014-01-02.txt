From the same to the same

My dear friend
++ It is indeed a trial of faith and love, and pure obedience but if on trying the fleece wet and dry; if on consulting again and again the divine oracle of the revelation of the Spirit, they believe it their duty to go on this errand, I see no cause for them to be discouraged. If it be of the Lord he will stand by his own work, and make way, & room for the progress of it; his miraculous, healing, strengthening power is the same that ever it was; and he can sustain & supply his weak instruments as effectually in this day, as he did in the days of our forefathers, or in the days of the first publishers of the same gospel. And this gospel also is as precious & glorious as ever it was; dignifying beyond all temporal honour, those that are engaged in the promotion of it. How grateful it is to the purified spirit to be made the channel of communicating good from the living source of all good to any! What a holy, comfortable savour is left on the instrument of conveyance! And yet there is such a backwardness and unwillingness in many, such a pleading of unfitness for any little service, and such a want of attention and industry to seek & knock, and ask of him who is liberal in the distribution of his gifts and graces, that useful labourers are in number but like the gleaning of the vintage, or two or three berries on the outmost fruitful branches of the tree. I am pleased that thou wast visited by thy particular friends on thy admission there. [page number] 238 I wish thee to be often visited by the Master himself, whose reward is with him, as his work is before him: he comes not empty handed, and whether he brings the balm of consolation, or a whip of small cords, to drive all that is improper out his temple, still his coming is for good, & he is in all humility to be received in the way of his coming.
