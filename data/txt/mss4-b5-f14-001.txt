Don't be alarmed my Dear Molly, at my so soon again taking up
my pen, or suppose that from one extreme I mean to run to the other & tire thee out
with my letters - I am concerned for having sent thee three pennyworth of perplexity
by the last post - I suppose from what I wrote thou may be under some apprehension
about the safety of [underline]thy little things[/underline], which we fully expected thou had got
before now, & was surprized at thy Father writing about the bags, but upon Tommy
questioning Kelly about them, he tells him he left the baskets in which they were
packed in Francis street, as the weather was so wet when he went last - I hope thou
got the other parcels safe - Tommy went to examine it, & finds it undisturbed, with
it, he now takes thy Zadiq, Liquorice, tape or riband (forsooth) nails & the Satin for
Anna, also the Book of Brothers (which if opportunity offers he requests may be sent
to M Hutton Mt.melick) packed in a basket with hats for thy Brother, he also takes
the Porter - all which I hope will get safe, tho' 'I think there is some hazard in sending
by said Kelly - I am [underline]hoping[/underline] after thee still, I think as much as the day thou
left this, for a little bit, I thought thy example excited me to some more industry, but
alass! I have got to my old way a gain - I must be short, because I want to have some
room for thy better half (so called) - I hear as if poor Edward has an aching heart, so has
had many a one before him, for want I believe of timely consideration, but I hope
folkes will grow wiser, some from their own experience, & some from other peoples -
I am rather asham'd to ask thee to write to me, knowing I dont deserve it, but thou
art generous, notwithstanding, I do not wish thee to write unless thou art prompted
thereto by inclination - I read the latter part of thy letter to Rich..d Pike, he
seemed [unclear]directed [/unclear]at it, & reaconed thy partiality for Sister was very visible. -
farewell my beloved Molly (for all that) & be sure thou thinks [underline]less[/underline] about thy
Mt..melick [underline]friends[/underline] than of thy own - -
The account I gave of my beloved friend to Sister was
pleasing I say its high enough of her to desire thou wilt
think less of thy Mtmelick friends than of her, but thou can
know the meaning of the heart. I tell her thou endeavour'd to
make use of some of thy discretion, and succeeded in the attempt.
I often thought of thee after we parted, and since my
return home, it would be in vain to think of it, or I would
gladly back Sister in her proposal for thee to stay a bit with
us after the meeting. I wish this visit to Munster was defered

but we must or ought to be content - We did not get home
until seventh day, left Mtmelick a fifth day, I got a seat with
R. Jackson in her Cousins chair, I hear I am a grate favourite of
the old mans, that he was quite pleased that Rachel had me
for a companion, we reach'd Tullylost in good time for dinner
where we met a cordial kind reception, Tommy seem'd much
better than I expected from what I had heard of him, next day
we spent most of it with Aunt Newenham, I was well pleased
I went, she appeared to me better than when I saw her last,
near three years ago, we returned to Tullylost that night, and
next day pursued our journey in the boat, we were not so
crowded as when going, but the company far more disagreeable.
I never saw cards play'd before, I could make neither
head nor tale of them, nor would I ever wish to see them play'
again, tho they were brave and quiet while at it, it was
preferable to hearing their [unclear]ratting[/unclear] profane discourse. Rachel
came off better than when going, tho she was not clever.
I believe she wont travel in the boat again, if she can avoid
it, and I am allmost out of concert with it to. I do prefer
rolling over a rough road [insertion]in a carriage[/insertion] with agreeable company, or
dodgeing a long (of a fine day) behind some [underline]well meaning[/underline]
[underline]young boy[/underline] - William Pike is perceiveably worse, he lost ground
considerably the few days he was in the country, the change of air
and the weather being sharper just at that time was too much for
him. Jonathan and Joseph remains there and are much better.
Betsy they hear is bravely - Nancy Alexander cant yet stand,
they had a Surgeon the other day to examine her, he says the
bone of her knee is crack'd, that it will be tedious. Sam
Alexander is about leaveing William, and is on the look out
for a house to begin business on his own account. I should
have said before that our Dr Cousin Pike continues to mend tho
slowly, I hear Theres no Prospect of her being fit to be in Town
at thee meeting indeed was she able to come there might be danger
of her exerting her self to much - Co I Dawson got a hurt
on his leg in the boat, I expect it wont signify much, tho
at present it confines him - When desire and inclination unite
or well over, perhaps it arises partly from a selfish motive,

I would be gratify'd by hearing from thee, believe me my Dr
Molly I had no doubt of thy affection, nor notwithstanding
[unclear]I was[/unclear] insinuation there was no occation to send me a
Susys insinuation there was no occation to send me a
Benjamin portion of love to convince me of it, I don't think
I have much jealousy in my disposition, I only meant Sister
had [unclear]join'd[/unclear] in Thy esteem, and I knew her to be deserving of
had gain'd in thy esteem, and I knew her to be deserving of
it, and I was concious of my own insignificance, and I
believe said something of her being more worthy [insertion]of thy[/insertion] regard, if
only what I often thought, and often wondered what thou
or any one could see in me to be fond of, I am very [unclear]sensible[/unclear]
thou loves me a great dale better than I deserve, and I
believe thought no more of what pass'd that night - with
as affectionate remembrance of you all as I am capable of
I remain thy Mary Benley
