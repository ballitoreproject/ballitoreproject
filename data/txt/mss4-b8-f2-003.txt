Dear Elizabeth
I am really ashamed
to have suffered so much time to pass over
without writing to thank you for your last
letter; [deletion]but[/deletion] on receipt I intended to have done
so very shortly, only that many causes & among
others, indolence, caused me to put off doing so
from time to time; when I was inclined to do so
I knew of no opportunity of sending a letter & therefore
did not write; and when there was an opportunity
I was not prepared. I am aware that
these excuses are really no excuses at all but I
do not wish you should think better [insertion]of me[/insertion] than I
deserve, by attributing my not writing to business.
I am absolutely astounded at what you say
of me in your letter; what I have done to
warrant your opinion, I know not; If you
intend to quiz me, you are welcome, if you are

serious, how can I sufficiently thank you for
your good opinion; candour at least - but
let it pass.
I am much obliged to you for your exhorting
[deletion][/deletion] me to bear up against Indolence &
most cordially agree with your observations & have
tried to resist "the Evil One". Yet I dont know
how it is, I am afraid [insertion]it is[/insertion] with little avail: however
I shall not despair: I know well that
to be indolent is a fearful state of mind, that
it is the greatest enemy of all improvement, yet
I feel it very hard to break thro' its trammels:
it is a most ungenerous enemy to deal with, as it
renders one incapable of using the weapons, where
with it is to be conquered: a person under its
influence may be said to be nearly in the situation
of one on whom the Rattlesnake exerts its power
of fascination. he feels its spell, & sees his
danger, yet cannot withdraw from the "inchanted
circle." -
There is no time like spring whether
Spring of the Year, the Spring of Human
Life or the Spring of a day (alias morning). there
is a fresh & invigorating principle of life stirring
around & within us, which make us enjoy every thing

in a tenfold degree. The day on which I received your
letter was as you may suppose very favourable to
such enjoyment & it was not thrown away on me.
I have sometimes thought (Heaven forgive me if it
is wrong) that if the soul could be freed from its
grosser thoughts & all that purged away which
most intimately connect us with the "beasts that
perish' & nothing left but its most intellectual
part, that I could be satisfied to have my everlasting
dwelling in scenes such as the most beautiful
I am acquainted with, if they always wore
the inspiring garb of Spring: but this is only
in my [unclear]day[/unclear] dreams & when my imagination
takes wing & embellishes those scenes with all that
I most admire & love - but the tenor of this
last paragraph on reading it over, reminds me
that I am showing symptoms of journeying to
the land of Nod & I therefore bid you farewell with
the hope that this "thing of shreds & patches," tho'
I am conscious how unworthy it is, may serve as a
memento of yours truly
R Barrington
it is just on the stroke of twelve
