Ballitore: 21st:11th month 1784.
My Dear cousin,
I have been determined for some time past to write a
few lines to thee if I cou'd, but as we have had [insertion]company[/insertion] mostly since we came
home, & many things to mind, & my weak sight prevents me attempting
to write any, unless to set any thing down to prevent my forgetting it, or
such little matters; so that I cou'd not well put in execution what
I intended to thee; first I may honestly say I was, with the rest of our
family, greatly disapointed at not having the agreeable society in thy
company which we proposed to ourselves; & much concerned for the
cause of it, the loss of thy eldest son: this child was near to me, as he
appeared to be in the innocence & simplicity, that too many are above,
& thereby I hope in an acceptable state to be removed to a better country
but when I heard in Dublin of the remaining son being also ill, I
was really much affected with thy trouble, & sympathized with you
in it, but was relieved by hearing of James being thought better,
& since that several times, thro' one or other, of his mending: such
trying dispensations, must be permitted for some good purpose,
the chastenings of the almighty hand, as a tender father [insertion]over[/insertion] his
children, is no doubt, intended to bring nearer to himself in affection
& obedience, that so they may be more & more weaned from things
that are below, & their affections more set on things that are above, &
the spirit more & more purifyed & fitted to inhabit the abode where
the spirits of the innocents are ( we hope) settled for ever.
Thou may I suppose have, heard, that our poor Sally has been
ill this good while with a lump on the side of her throat not inwardly,
the doctor strove to get it to go back, but as it seemed not

not likely to do so, he has strove to bring it forward, & it now appears
as if it might be launced in a few days. Anna Tavernor, who
has been long ill, continues so, but is thought better of some complaints
but speechless above two weeks. Dear M: Jenkins & Dolly
were at our meeting last 4th day, at Castledermot 5th & Athy 6th. She
is I think a sweet spirited lively minister. I wou'd write some more
(I believe) but the hour is come to go to meeting. So with all our love
Dear love to thee & the family in general, I conclude & am thy
affectionate sympathizing frd & cousin
I am sorry to hear Dear nancy
Pike is still ailing, hope to hear
a better acct. soon.
