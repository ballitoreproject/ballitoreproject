My dear Uncle

	My husband tells me that he did not conceal my writing to thee by him & repenting seasonably for detaining it, by which thou wilt at least be convinced that I did not forget thee; for truly I did not nor the feelings of my mind on perusing thy last acceptable epistle, but having through unmeritted [sic] favour a little treasure in my earthern [sic] vessel I was afraid of prodigality, especially when the prospect of future necessities opened to my view & my own unworthiness of having more dispensed to me if I did not approve myself a good steward over that which I had 
	Now I am reduced to poverty  it therefore appears seasonable by the messenger brother Sam. sends to Kilkenny to tell thee so, hoping thou mayst be furnished with bread & thy usual liberality of which I may share  beggars we say ought not to be choosers & my appetite coincides there with  if it be but sound bread, such as thou art wont to dispense, it will be acceptable; for it ^is^ not a time to let out the mind after delicacies, a prospect of which thou hast been informed evidently requires a little strength & that strength perhaps depends upon wholesome food, good air & right exercise  It is not enough to see a thing to be right (though in the present case that may perhaps be called in question) but we must also dwell where the qualifications for the acceptable performance of it are obtained  Truly my honoured friend the prospect is awful, too much so to be treated with lightness  the consciousness of my ^own^ insufficiency ^for services^ much less weighty & the frequent presentation of many new trials necessarily attendant on the first entrance of Quakerism into a country where the principles & manners of the people are diametrically opposite thereot, setting aside such as cannot ^be^ naturally foreseen, often involve me for a moment into the depths of dismay & seem to close up every avenue which leads to the source of omnipotent help; but upon the whole since the disclosure of the exercise to my friends a peaceful serenity & quiet resignation have supported me from drooping, or even looking at the gloomy side of things to my humble admiration, & gospel love has at times so gained the ascendancy over selfish considerations that I have been 
ready to conclude ^it was given^ me as a sort of bounty money & to ground me in the beleif [sic] that however our journey thro life is perplexed by our own indiscretions & the envier [?] of our happiness, wisdom ways are nevertheless ways of pleasantness & all her paths ^are^ peace  thus variously is my mind occupied, but always desirous of standing open to new discoveries respecting the surrender of myself that if now the will should be graciously accepted for the deed or if my friends in this or my own land judge it best for me to decline it, my heart may receive it ^these monitors^ as cordially as the greatest torrent of approbation  this disposition preserves me at times from unprofitable thoughtfulness about my own incapacity for such a service & renewedly convinces me that by taking ever so much ^thought^ I cannot add one cubit to my stature or make one hair of my head white or black  Please to say if thou writes me soon whether the rules of society in this lane require the subject before us being laid before the national meeting no friend here has suggested it to me but I should be sorry to break our church order because it generally appears to be gospel order tho I acknowledge that previous to that has seemed to me to be the right time & if I should be suffered to go the company of my husband in such a Land as France I shall esteem a great favour & yet if we do not meet with others under the like concern we hope to be excused when it comes to the point  we wrote to G Door [?] after ouf m. meeting & have his answer today by which we conclude that if all outward obstructions were removed we might go in his company but the same objections which operated last summer still existing renders his path difficult  If our confidence is rightly placed perhaps the great Head of the Church may make a way where there seems no way for really this our mutually beloved friend is or has been in a true spot on this account  he tells us that H. [?] Wilkins is departed also Henry Sterry & Henry Rise [?] the bald headed door keeper at Gracechurchstreet  George & Sally were removed from the Poultry [seal torn off] George Stacys  our poor A Broadhead is often principally occasioned by the situation of her mind which is frequently buffetted [sic] & tried many ways sometimes she cheers a little & then as thou says shes good for something  if we should leave a while I am in hopes it will be for her benefit  she has a great love for & attachment to thy family & I am pleased to find it reciprocal  she received a few words fitly spoken from they valueable [sic] son & bids me acknowledge it with her love in which if he is not coming with sister include mine  I oftener think of you all than I have ability to express it  I dont doubt but my beloved Aunt Shackleton feels for me & surely neither she nor thyself ^will^ with hold such counsel as you may be favoured with  my dear Molly Sally & Lydia are all affectionately remembered by my RG & thy affectionate S. R. Grubb

PS Our family & friends here are generally well as usual M. Dudley has had the toothach [sic] to a great degree as she has all troubles  we are all pleased with the thoughts of our beloved sister Margarets return your joy would be mutual during her stay at Ballitore  My dear love is Anna Taverner
