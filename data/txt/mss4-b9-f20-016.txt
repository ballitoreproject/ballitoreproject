My dear Elzith
Did the Coachman charge for taking
the basket? his niece told me he
could take it free or I would not have sent
it that way & I begg'd that he wd let
me know if he could not take it that
I might send for it now let me pay
the Carriage as it was my fault not to
do what I was desired about it - the [unclear]milk[/unclear]
was for Deb! Was it not extremely kind
of her to offer to take Willy? I think him
improving he runs about the parlour
without any assistance so that I hope
he will soon be fit to send I think he
would be greatly benefitted by the change
of air & D's kind care . Margaret I
think looks as well as I have ever seen
her & is able to take a good long walk

I will pay the bill soon I intend if Edw
has not already done it, I read letters
&c &c from G Downes I had a very
our health - I am quite satisfied
with the bill, it is deligetful to think
that all debts will be soon paid not
that we will gain by it but that nothing
may be murmur'd at on our dear father's
account - Deb; says that M S is going
to Munster & that H W has just return'd
I know not what is going on amongst
you Did Hannah pay a visit in Waterford?
So Magt Davis is quite a treasure
surely she is very young I remember her
a very little girl when I went to Waterford
with my aunt Sally in 1817
so thou expected Edw that night
I'm glad he did not disappoint
thee, it was a pity he would not stay
longer, I was disappointed to see
him come home alone I hoped
to have seen C & D & Johnny however
that pleasure is in store for me
show this to Deb: Edw bought me a scrap
from her I shall wait till I see her before
I do any thing about a servant & would
rather not speak to Jane Dowling at
present - I paid her soap & candle bill
to John or Richd tell her she must have
the reminder when we meet
I have not got much news from Ed yet
& I have not got much news from Ed yet
ever thy SB
few lines from W kind enquiries after
