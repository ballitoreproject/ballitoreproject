The evening was finer than the
morning and the country appeared
to great advantage - We had tea
and any welcome it was on our
arrival after which [deletion]the[/deletion] Mr Paughton
and his three young ladies took their
departure - Charlie left us at
[unclear]Phul a Phuca[/unclear] at about five so
we had not much of his company
I enjoyed this day but not
so much as yesterday
5 Friday - -As we [insertion]Isabel and I[/insertion] had been invited
to Griesemount to spend the day
we set off early in the phaeton
Just as we were going through
the yard Richard came up and
asked us to wait a minute till
he got his fishing rod, which we
did so we had his company
all the way- - Hannah Shackleton
was very kind and showed
[insertion]almost[/insertion][underline]all[/underline]over over the place - -of the girls

been spending a while at home,
