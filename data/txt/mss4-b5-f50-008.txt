30 Aungier street 3 of 12 Month 1818
My dear friend,
I received thy very acceptable
letter dated the 15th of last month.
I am rejoiced to hear of Lydia's improvements, &
most sincerely hope that it will increase progressively.
I often thought,
& often told her that all she
wanted was to [underline]think[/underline], & now that it appears she has
thought, & improved thereby, my hopes are sanguine
So Ballitore still continues to be the " classic vale,"
full of teachers, five or six schools, & Eben is teaching,
Sarah is teaching, Lydia is teaching, what a harvest
we must expect from so much seed sown!
I was indeed delighted with [deletion]the Fairy[/deletion] thy extracts
from the Fairy Queen, & intend to read it when I
have [underline]time[/underline] & opportunity. Perhaps when I next visit
Ballitore, I may read some of it, & thus have
the[deletion]enjoyment[/deletion] pleasure heightened by association with
my other enjoyments there.

Our new Society (The Literary & Scientific Society") is a
source of much entertainment & I believe instruction to
all the members of it. We meet to night, & are to receive
an essay from Edward Barrington " On Magnetism."
The subject which I proposed writing on, &
for which I am already preparing myself, is the doctrine
of Malthus respecting Population. A very strong &
widely spread prejudice exists against his writings, but
so it is in the beginning against every new plan for
the improvements of Mankind. — Harvey, the famous discoverer
of the circulation of the blood, lost almost all
his practice, & was deserted by all [insertion]of[/insertion] his profession for
maintaining, as was then thought, much an absurd opinion.
But it was so ordained, & without doubt,
wisely, that the world should be slow in coming to
the knowledge of Truth. Although this is an enquiring
& an enlightened age, yet still there are a few "strong
holds" which it becomes the champions of Truth to
lay siege to, & force a surrender. We have lately
lost an able champion in the cause of bloodless punishments-
Sir Samuel Romilly, — a name dear to
every friend of humanity.

Thomas Fayle left this on seventh day for Clapham, to
bring us Mary Chandlee, who will receive some hearty
welcomes when she comes.
Wishing you all success in every good work &
hoping thou will write to me as soon as convenience
will allow thee, & I remain thy affectionate friend
Thomas Fisher.

Mary Leadbeater
Ballitore
