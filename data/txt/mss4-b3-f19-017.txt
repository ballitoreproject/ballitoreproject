Dear Uncle


        I got the enclosed receipt a few days since from Archibald to transmit to thee he said if thou would write to him he would follow thy example: On his return from Dublin they could not get as far on their journey the first day as they expected which prevented him from putting in execution a design he had formed of giving you the favour of his company for a while He is not quite so well now as he was at his return & his wife has been of late much indisposed of late at times. I was much shocked on hearing of Paul Johnsons enterprise & surprised no one could be got to give him the punishment his villainy deserved. Did not he think his presence so unexpected at such an unseasonable hour & in such an extraordinary manner sufficient to strike the girls with horrour & so took care to come armed. [sic] It is not easy to imagine what gallant action he will perform next if permitted to roam about still: He has a mind to cut a conspicuous figure & takes strange methods to effect his purpose: but enough of a disagreeable subject. I observe M. Whelan has found a man hardy enough to connect his fate with hers I think him possessed of a great resolution & wish neither of them may have cause to repent. Ned Kennedy too has carried his pointWell now I suppose with the help of Sallys fortune he will be enabled to discharge his bond to his former mistress. A Daughter of Joshua Strangmans [sic] ^(Betsy)^ is soon to present her marriage with Richard Davis a young man who follows the Coopering Business for Strangman & Co. I hope to hear of Cousin Debbys continuing finely & her little one & that my Aunt, Molly & Sally are brave & hearty. My Love to all Friends
        I am Dear Uncle
                thine affectionately
                        William Rayner
