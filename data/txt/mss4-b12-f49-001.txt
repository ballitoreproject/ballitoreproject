 On reading my Dear _'s most affectionate Lre
I understand I may propose to myself a happiness
which I thought I never should arrive at - I need
not say I shall have a sensible satisfaction
in taking you by the hand, Because I'm -
persuaded you're convinced of my regards. -
therefore shall evade all Ceremony & only add
that the disinterested Love which you have -
shewn, together with your family's friendly -
regards expressed for me this some time past,
Lay me under such obligations to them, & you
particularly, as will never be in my Power
Sufficiently to acknowledge; I can only entertain
a gratefull sense of your favour to the late[deletion]e[/deletion]st
Moment of my Life. But if my future -
attention in adding to your wellfare & happiness
will in any wise recompense, & I flatter
myself in saying I'll never be remiss -

Please do accept of my best wishes & Greatest
Esteem & your's to command.
Philip Stacpole
