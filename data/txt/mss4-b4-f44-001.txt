to Joseph Hatton?
My Dear frd.
Tho' I have not had a Letter from thee this great while
thought I cou'd not but send thee a line or two, to tell thee
thou art often in my remembrance, & I wou'd willingly hope I
am not quite forgotten by thee, tho' I think sometimes I am
scarce worth taking up the least place in my frds. minds:
am so little good for; but I endeavour to keep from doing any
[insertion]thing[/insertion] that appears to me a dishonour [insertion]to[/insertion] the precious Truth, which has
often been to me dearer than Life: may I ever be kept from
joining with the multitudes that do, even in this city, who cause
Greif & Sorrow to encompass the truehearted Isrealites, this I believe
thou well knows, haveing [insertion]had[/insertion] to simpathize with such many a time;
[deletion][/deletion] tho' this be too much the case, let me not afflict thee with
complaints, but rather comfort thee by [deletion]letting thee know[/deletion] [insertion]informing[/insertion] that
we have many I hope that increase in their Love to Truth; & who
knows but we may have more company yet in that road, as those
who have been in it stand faithful in all things.
We have been favour'd with the company of our frds. E: Peckover
Ann Gunner, & Mary Artis; the former seem'd to have the chief
service of the meeting, & was much favour'd therein, & indeed the whole
that was at is, have cause to be humbly than[insertion]k[/insertion]ful to the author of
all Good for affording his poor children, a degree of comfort & strength
(when almost ready to faint in their minds) & enable them to renew
their covenants with him, & to give themselves up to his Disposal, let
him see meet to deal with them as he please; whether to comfort or afflict
yet believing tis for the one Good End: even to bring us nearer to himself
& if he is pleas'd to try with afflictions is it not a sign that he has regard
to us? for whom he loves he chasteneth: thus my Dr. frd. my Desires are
that I may be assisted to get to an holy Resignation of mind, let what
will come, but I find it not always attainable; We had likewise (since
the meeting) the national visit performed here, & some of us heartily
wish it may prove affectual; they set out 5th day for Country Wicklow, & I
suppose thy frd. J. Greer is to be back here to night, by whom, I think to
send this; & who can give thee a better or more sensible acct. of things at
this meeting, than I am capable: by him I understand thou are very poorly
but I hope in a little time thou'l be lighten'd of thy heavy burden:
Ann Gunner & Co, I believe are to visit the families or part of them in [unclear][/unclear]
this city. If thou are able to let me hear from thee it wou'd be a grace
& how the English frds. are. I now take my leave desiring to be remember
by thee, & with Mother's & Sisters Dr. Love to thee, Conclude thy affet. frd.
Eliz Carleton
Dublin ye 11 mo. 17th 1753.
