        From the same to the same
London: 20th of 5th month 1788
                        
My dear James,
++ Some sweets seem as it were due to thee after all thy bitters - If sorrow be witnessed in the night & among the deeds of darkness, joy comes in the morning, in the dawn of the bright day of God's salvation, which thou hast often witnessed, &, I hope & trust, my dear friend, will often witness to arise upon thee - Be, therefore faithful unto death, that thou may not, after all thy trials, conflicts, temptations, & buffettings miss of the crown of life.
