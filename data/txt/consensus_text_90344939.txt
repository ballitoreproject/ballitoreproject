of going down to the Waterford
meeting this week, so there
was an end to all our enjoym[unclear]ent[/unclear]
together, however we cannot
always have our wishes. Well
to put off the evil hour as long
as we could, we ordered Hylan
not to have the carriage ready
until about four - and Polly
brought me up to show me
one of her yesterday's feats i.e
a great leap she took on their
return yesterday through the
fields. It certainly was a
good leap for Polly [deletion]a[/deletion]much greater
than I thought - We then
went down Jem Byrne's bank
to look at another which sh
took and came home by
the brows - Philip went
down to a cattle show held
in Bray - and has not yet
returned tho' it is past seven
and I am waiting tea for
him all by myself & very lonely,
