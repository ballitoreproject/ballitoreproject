Dear Wm-
While I was in Mt. Mellick Seventh day
Ellis came from Phillipstown & to[insertion]ok[/insertion] away
my bed desk & large Oak table and is determind
to sell them On second day before 10 O Clock,
he's satisfied to take security for
the money and give my things back so I
beg you'll go to Phillpstown before the
hour of 10 on second day and give security &
you may rely on me paying you again the time
if I'm [insertion]oblig'd[/insertion] to sell the property Ellis has afor it
I've no friend but you to do any thing for me
I'll go now to Phillipstown and expect you
there to morrow no more at present from Jn.o Leadbeater

I forgot to mention that he took your Cow another
table Candle Sticks & pot looking glass & other
things, so now I mention'd to you every sercumstance
of the matter & if you let them be
sold I may say for nothing bid farewell for
ever to your only brother that never Deceiv'd
you Jn.o Leadbeater
