Banbridge
Thursday
My dear Selina
I have yours
received yesterday
& to-day to acknowledge -
As you
wish it - I have
no news to say
I therefore wrote
to Newrath Bridge
last night -
I think we might
leave before 8 or
on the 16th - for
if Newrath Bridge
Hotel is the kind
of a place I suspect
it is - [deletion]you[/deletion] [insertion]we[/insertion]
might go on in
to Wicklow -
I wrote your father
naming David Haughton
as my Trustee & I got

a copy of the deed
this morning from
John Haylett & our
attorney I have
sent it back to-night -
if you
have on opportunity
ask your
father where David
Haughton should
come on Tuesday
to sign it -
The [unclear]Chiffoniere[/unclear]
is got and paid for
I think I have
everything I intend
getting now - but
when you come -
I dare say you
will observe many
things wanting -
I think the Piano
should be this
shape [drawing] so as
to set along
the wall opposite
the fire place -
the player facing
the door & with
their back to the
wall in the corner
near the window.
Another week!
I wish it was over
- fortunately for me
I have a [underline]great[/underline]
[underline]deal[/underline] to do - I
had Sam'l & Cha's
Murland here to
Breakfast [insertion]at 7 o'c[/insertion] this morning
after a drive of 14
miles & went off
with them to a
funeral of a young
Mr. Malcolm in Lurgan
- he was only 21
years of age - I was
very intimate with
him - he had been
travelling on the

continent & on his
return about 10 days
since was taken
ill of Fever -
I see you are
getting a Host of
presents - David
has changed his
to a sett of Dessert
Knives & Forks -
Sally sent me
yesterday 2 cushions
- some pin cushions
& I believe some other
things - but I have
not had time to
examine them yet.
I wrote to Mary
Jane asking her
here for Saturday
evening - I don't
suppose I shall
have any one
else - I got the
gloves yesterday
2/6 & 3/ p pair -
of course I am

greatly flattered with Florence's
opinion - how could I be
otherwise - with the opinion
of such a judge -
I have no books [insertion]worth receiving[/insertion] except
a few novels & 20 or 24
volumes of an encyclopedia
- I have John Halifax - Uncle
Toms' cabin - Key to do &
some works on Mechanics &
on political Economy -
I intend bringing a rug
on our trip - which should
be enough for our knees
& if lost will not be so great

a loss as your fur cloak
would be -
I find a great many people
about here did not send
cards - Lons Ferguson
for one & Charles Murland
for another - and I have
met very few that
disapprove of it -
You have not written
me a word such as I asked
you to do - I suppose you
are entering on that callous
indifferent state that Bessie
descibes - I almost think
I am going to be so myself
also - At any rate I am
still your loving
[underline]Robert Fennell[/underline]
I am just off to Donacloney
