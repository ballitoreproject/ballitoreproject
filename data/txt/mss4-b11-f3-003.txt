Dear Brother
thy kind letter I reicd and was glad to
hear of your health & wellfare every way but
am sory to hear no bett account of poor Brother
Mason and his famaly poor Molly I fear hath
turned her back of her profession in a great
mesure & indeed for conversation hear bespoke
her not very stedaly [insertion]fined[/insertion] to any religeous principles
and I fear if shee be got into a famaly of other
perswations shee wil easly be drawn aside from
the simplisaty of the truth I greatly desire shee
may be preserved for shee is a young woman of a
great deal of with I acknowlage thy kind invitation
into Iraland as allso thy kind proposals to
poor Daniel which I acknowlage with a great
deal of grattitude but thou may be sure it is a
near tryal both to his mother and me to be part with
him to such a distance & as I cannot tell well what
business those hath cannot tell how to judge of a
for a child but to be sure a Butcher is a trade
neither I nor my wife have any likening for but as
he hath not gon through the whole cours of his
learning not having made much profition
in writeing as those art so kind to offer to
give him a years schooling we are upon consideration
willing to let him com over for a while
and if anything offer agreeable it may be he -
may stay longer; he is a fine sharp lad and of
a quick witt I think as any of my children and
I think after he hath a great deal of his Uncle
Roberts Brisk disposition if it so happen that
we com it will be whole to be about the back
 and of next or begining of the 7th month [unclear]wch.[/unclear]
if the Lord permit I hope our seeing eatch other
will be to our mutual sattisfaction this with
mine and my wives dear Love to thee and sister
as allso to Brother & sister Bewley when thou [insertion]sees you[/insertion] allso
Brother Mason and his [deletion]fam[/deletion] Children is what
offereth at present from thy Love in Brother
and sister
