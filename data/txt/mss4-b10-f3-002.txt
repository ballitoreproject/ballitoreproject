My dear Sister
I am sadly puzzled about
what coloured coat and continuations
I ought to purchase for the
approaching fete, please to send me
word by return of post whether you
think a black coat derk trowsers
and white waistcoat would be suitable
for the Occasion. As I abomenate
light Cloth trowsers and no other
coloured coat took well without
bright buttons

Please to give me your opinion
about this important subject and
you will much oblige your affectionate
 Brother [unclear]AB[/unclear]
