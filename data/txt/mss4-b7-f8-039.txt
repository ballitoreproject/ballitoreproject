Waterford Firstmonth 24th 1791
My dear Mary
I had scarce time enough since
my arrival to inform thee that I am still in the
land of the living & still cannot promise myself
much more than sufficient to say so much. I wrote
to my Aunt from Mullinavat where I consulted
my own ease by getting into a Carriage I overtook
& was completely recovered of the fatigue of journeying
on horseback to which I am so little inured
I hope Davy got home safe & that thy Mare
was not worse of her lameness - I send this by
Ab.m. Henderson who is about to take a tour in
Leinster & notwithstanding he may not find thee
at home shall inquire how affairs are going on
in Ballitore as thou wilt certainly be informed
Wm. Rayner
Waterford: 24/1 mo: 1791

during thy absence — Thou hast got an additional tie
to the village which may probably limit thy ramble
I hope Richd Manders has recovered without suffering
much by that accident - Please tell my uncle
I delivered his message to P Rogers who is
in no hurry about settling that little affair -
he may see by the enclosed receipt that I did
not neglect his other commission - Wm Penrose told
me he had consulted a Lawyer respecting the propriety
of signing as he has done - Please tell Polly Mellor
if convenient that I executed her commission Is
Cousin Debby relieved from her anxiety about her
children Do let me know how she & they are & if
Thomas has caught the infection - If at home present
me affectionately to all there if abroad to
thy fellow traveller MB — I remain
thine sincerely
Wm Rayner
Dr Davis is in the North.
Have you heard the sequel
of Matilda's adventures.
