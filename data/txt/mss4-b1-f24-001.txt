A Vision of Hester Rutter.
I thought I was [insertion]dead[/insertion], & beh[deletion]o[/deletion][insertion]e[/insertion]ld my body [deletion]lay[/deletion] [insertion]laid[/insertion] like a corps: there seemed
to be a person in the appearance of a man: his raiment [insertion]somewhat[/insertion] of a sheepskin
or a light fawn-color, who said, "follow me": he ascended a
hill, on the top of which was a large building: the outside appeared
strongly built with rough stones. I followed my guide into the
house, but did not at first see the beauty of it to the full: it seemed
then white & bright, & a large company sitting, such a number
as I never beheld: the farther we went in, the brighter it appear'd,
& more like the reflection of the sun: the first stop my guide
made seemed to be more than halfway the house, by what I
judged the appearance of the length of the building on the outside:
while my guide stopped, I looked at the countenance
of those I could see, which were many, but could not see to the
farther end for the reflection of the light, which appear'd
brighter than when the sun shines in it's fullest lustre
on a summer's day: there appear'd a sweetness & composure
in every countenance, far beyond what I ever saw in
any person in my lifetime, & a lustre reflected from them,
that which extended to the skirts of their garments,
which appear'd like a robe, or covering in one piece,
so that I was filled with admiration. I looked to see
if I could distinguish men from women, but could
not:

not: then I looked to see if there was any [insertion]one[/insertion] I knew, but I knew not
one: on my first entrance into the house, I thought I had been
at a Meeting of solid [underline]friends[/underline]: I looked to see from whence the
light came, but could [insertion]not[/insertion] discern either window, or opening. I
then asked my guide, "What place is this: he answer'd, "Heaven."
then I looked to see what they sat on, but could not discern
either [deletion]either[/deletion] seats or forms: the more I looked, the more I admired,
& wanted to sit down with them but could not tell how: my
guide turned about to go out & looked at me to follow him;
but I was so much delighted that I was unwilling to follow
him: he then beckoned to me again & stopp'd a little for
me, & said again, "come." I followed after, halting & admiring
the pleasures I saw in every countenance till we got
out: then my guide turned on the left hand, & we seemed
to go down: I did not perceive the road we went, but could
see my guide before me: we soon came where I beheld a
lofty grand arched room which I cou'd not see the end
of till we passed through this room, which appear'd
grandly wainscoted & beautifully painted with
different colors: the first sight of this beautiful room
abated my sorrows, which were very great while
we came down the descent for leaving the other.
