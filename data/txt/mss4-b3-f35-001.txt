Richard Shackleton to R.W.


My dear R:
        I heard with much satisfaction lately of thy being mercifully visited by a great & good Guest, & that thou had happily opened the door of thy heart, & let him in. This was matter of gladness to my mind to hear: but in my secret, solemn presenting myself before the Most High when I found thee near to my spirit, & my soul was prostrated within me in humble petition & thankfulness on thy account behalf; then was my joy more full. I rejoiced & gave thanks unto God, for that He was graciously pleased to visit the offspring & descendents of his faithful people, even in the remote land of their captivity, where they would inevitably have perished everlastingly, if His own right hand & arm of power had not most providentially interposed, & saved them from perpetual destruction. The God of thy forefathers; the help, the comfort, the everlasting husband of my dear friend thy mother, hath loved thee, even when thou wert too much in a state of rebellion against his inward law: therefore he mercifully plucked thee as a brand out of the fire. The time that is past cannot be lived over again; the actions that have been done cannot now be undone: but for the time to come, may it be thy daily & hourly care to use all diligence to live to his honour, who has been so good to thee, & to atone ^[different ink/hand] compensate^ for past omissions & trespasses by future watchfulness & obedience! I trust, from my feelings respecting thee, that the Gospel-net has caught thee; abide thou patiently [page number] 100 and in stillness within the its [sic] safe enclosure, & beware of seeking to get again into even the verge, or outmost skirts of that sea of commotion and danger, out of which thou hast, in great mercy, been measurably drawn. Be inward in spirit, breathing in secret to the Father of spirits for thy preservation through a world thick-planted with dangers & temptations. Look not too much at others out at the conduct of others, nor adopt their liberty as the rule of thy conduct. Good examples are too thinly-sown; and too few hold a chaste conversation coupled with the fear of God. Some who are far advanced in years, & by their appearance & stations ought to be as way-marks to the spiritual traveller, guides & assistants to him on his journey, are either turned back again in their affections to the spirit of the world, in one shape or other; or are as cakes half-baked, having never thoroughly enough experiences the baptism of that spiritual fire, which would have made them complete in Christ, & first for his use. I commend thee, dear R, to the divine notice & protection, heartily desiring that He who has begun a good work in thee may carry it on & finish it to his praise & thy own present and eternal happiness: & in these unfeigned desires for thy welfare & preservation my wife sincerely joins
        thy affectionate friend
                Richard Shackleton
