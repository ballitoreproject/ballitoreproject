Hotel Wagram Paris June 7th 1850
My dearest Mama
Do not be uneasy about us, we are alive
and well, I could not get one minute to spare till now
so I write though I cannot send it sooner than to-morrow
and even then I must enclose it in one of Aunt Eliza's, who
is writing either to Grandmama or Aunt Martha and tell
them to post this on to thee as then it will not cost too much.
I wrote to Papa on Wednesday from London saying that Uncle
Thomas intended coming here, after we posted it we went
to St. Pauls, where we spent two hours sitting in the Golden
Gallery It is well worth seeing I was quite delighted with
it, - and having spent two more hours walking about
London we went into a dining house in Cheapside
at five oClock and dined, while we were walking
up that Street I counted sixteen Omnibuses and
twenty four cabs and fly's, mixed, passing down one
after the other before we could cross, having dined
we went to Uncle Richard's to tea and there we saw
Jane Doyle and Charlotte Allen, Uncle Thomas asked
Uncle Richard to come with us here but he would
not, we gave them farewell and left London yesterday
morning in [insertion]the[/insertion] twelve oClock [insertion]Train[/insertion] for Croydon, we arrived
there at half past twelve and as Aunt Elizabeth told us
that Mary Mason dined at one we waited at the [insertion]station[/insertion]

for more than an hour to give them time to be done
and amused ourselves with french to prepare of France
we left it at quarter to two and arrived at Mary
Mason's a little after two hoping they would be ready
but when we got there they had only sat down to
dinner, but Mary Mason helped Florence first &
she eat it as quick as she could and came to us,
in half an hour Mary Mason came to see us, And
Florence took me all over the house to see it. Mary
Mason gave Florence leave to come out with us to walk
and then Aunt Eliza having bought us something
to eat - sent Florence first to show us a nice [unclear]walk[/unclear]
she took us a very nice way through fields &c &c
but it was not far as we were caught in a very
heavy shower and had to return home, Mary Mason
had tea for us when we arrived and having done
ample justice to that we left it in time for the
Train that left that five minutes before six for Dover
It was a lovely evening and we had a delightful
journey when we arrived at Dover we went at once
to the Packet and found it was not to sail till quar[unclear]ter[/unclear]
past eleven oClock, we were the first on deck, and
as it was then twenty minutes to ten we went down
to the Cabin and got something to eat, cold roast
beaf bread and ale &c and then laid down to sleep
I was soon fast, but I awoke just in time to hear the
oClock strike eleven I knew then we would soon
be off as I heard great noise upon deck, we soon

began to move, then the people came down to lie
down, and some of the ladies were not two minutes
down when they began to be sick - it was sometime[deletion]s[/deletion]
before I got asleep again - but when I did, I did not
sleep long the Sick people made so much noise, we
got to Calais at twenty minutes to two this morning
early after a very nice passage and about half
past two we left it by rail way after a great
deal of bustle getting our Passports looked at,
English money changed, and seeing that our
Luggage was right, we slept coming
along in the train [deletion]o[/deletion]for about three
quarters of an hour at a time then
[unclear][/unclear] up and look about us and
fall asleep again, we arrived here. I
mean at the Station House five minutes
past nine and by the time our Luggage was
looked over and we safe here it was ten so we
got two nice bed rooms, my one which is larger than
Aunt Eliza's is our sitting room, after we had
breakfast, and had settled ourselves, after last night
we went to walk about the town and we went
into two Chapels to look at them and came back here
at six oClock got a [unclear]chop[/unclear] and our tea and ever
since I have been writing
8th Just as I finished the word "writing" [insertion]last night[/insertion] Uncle Thomas
came to take us out for a little bit, as night is the best
time for seeing the people in Paris for they all go out then

for pleasure, we first went into the Tuileries which are exactly
opposite our windows and we have a nice view in fact
the nicest I think in Paris, for I never saw such an ugly
town, [insertion]for[/insertion] from the appearance of the Streets as we came in yesterday
I thought we could not get such good lodgings, the two rooms we
have are very comfortable and are the highest story of the
house with a balcony before our windows the only fault we
have is that there are 120 steps up to it almost too much
for Aunt Eliza after a long walk, the way I manage it is to run
up as fast as I can (wh cant be very fast for the stairs are
Mahogany) and then sit down when I get to the top, I am
quite proud of my room, it is every way better than Aunt
Eliza's, And Uncle Thomas is so jealous of it that he is always
trying to make out that there are bugs in my bed, however he
has not that satisfaction [insertion]as there[/insertion] are not any, besides he ought to be very
good when I allow him to make it his sitting apartment, wh

we must do as it is larger than the other though' it has a smaller bed, and
a very nice one it is, with [deletion]with[/deletion] [insertion]white[/insertion] muslin curtains a very nice drapery with
handsome colours and tassles, a gilt top outside it is also very nice in side
I have three looking glasses one large one over the chimney peice the other
at the basin stand and the third is on [deletion]the[/deletion] [insertion]a[/insertion] stand, - we have three chest of drawers
and they all have marble tops two clocks one on each Chimney peice my one
is not going. I believe I have told you all the news so must conclude
with dear love to all I remain thy affection daughter Emily Malone.
If you write immediately after you received this here we might get it,
it must be under a quarter of an
ounce and ten pence is the price
the direction is, Thomas E Henry
Poste Restante
Paris
If you dont write the very instant
you get this we wont get it as
you will then have to direct to
Kensington as that is our next
place for we dont intend to stay
here long -
PS Aunt Eliza desired me to say that
our butter for breakfast is brought
up in a butter boat here.
