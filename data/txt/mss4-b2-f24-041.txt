My dear Father,


        I sent a letter off to thee fifth day evening, & this day was favoured with thine, informing of thy ^intending to^ having set out for Waterford ^yesterday^, & desiring my Husband to meet thee there early next week, he desires me to inform thee he intends to be with thee early on fourth day, perhaps about noon; he supposed that 5th day would have been timely, but finding thou art in Waterford, is diligently applying to his business, so as to have his affairs settled a day sooner, I wish we could have been together this intermediate space of time, for me to have had the great enjoyment of thy company, & I hope thou wilt not be detained too long or be dissatisfied about it. Thou mentions poor dear Cousin Abby Thompson, who is gone from our sight, kind, affectionate creature! I felt a pinch when I heard she was numbered with the dead, altho the corruptible part is so, yet I trust she is in possession of that life which is endless, for she appeared to me to have an honest heart, & to put her trust ^in^ Divine aid above all things, & as this was her concern, so I have a hope it attended her to the end of Time: it was satisfactory to have her beloved sister Christy with her then, & also her sister Hannah; I wrote to Cousin Debby since, as I felt so much about them, & felt myself to have lost one dear friend; I did sincerely love; so we must all drop off! thought I, & an awful reflection it is, why then ^are^ should our thoughts & views, & desires so apt to centre here? We have got our Abraham with us for a few days, his company is agreeable & his behaviour pleasing, he continues thin, but grown in stature, our children thro Divine favour well in health, & I should be glad to hear so of our sweet Peggy Shackleton, but alas! I fear it is hardly to be expected from what I hear of circumstances ^attending^ her case. I am troubled at times for her, but what can I do? only desire for them, & scarcely this as I would like: her Parents know well I believe where to flee to in this trial, her Father is so deep in best experience, it seems like superfluous to offer him Words, by way of consolation. E: Tuke has had a fine letter from him, with a brave account of our ^dear^ Sallys effusions.
        I much desire my dear Father & dear Husband may have a prosperous & comfortable journey together, & with gratitude to thee for joining to him, & waiting for him:
        I conclude thy obliged, dutiful &
                affectionate daughter
                        Margaret Grubb
My dear love to thy Host & family, also to afflicted Archy & his wife & daughter
