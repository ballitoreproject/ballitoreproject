which brought sad thoughts of its lovely mistress & then we
returned & dined & were played jokes on, by Joseph Harvey. I was
persuaded that an old gentleman, who was there, was Joseph
disguised - & until Joseph came really in, as a miserable poor
servant, I could not believe my senses - then I was terribly puzzled
to know who was who, & which was which. This made us quite
jolly & we [unclear]came[/unclear] home in high spirits. "So ended this ingenious
little artifice" [unclear][/unclear] we dined [insertion]one day[/insertion] at Reuben's - his wife is an interesting
looking woman, but I could not easily make free with her. Now
all our unsocial visitings are over & the Bride is exalted into
the Wife - Thou, my dearest Eben, liked Hannah Kilham I hear
[unclear]well[/unclear] thou wilt like to hear that some of her plans are put in execution.
There is a [unclear]visiting[/unclear] committee of which aunt Harvey made me
peradventure whether I would or no, a member I have got a [unclear]very[/unclear]
earnest & devoted companion - her name
Miss Langford, a neighbour of ours, & the
misery which we have witnessed is beyond
any thing I ever saw near Ballitore - they live, as the poor in [unclear]Dublin[/unclear]
many, very many families in one house - then the want of air
the filth - the numbers, are indeed most deplorable. Many, most
of them, anxious for work & cannot obtain it - One man, a smith
was lying in bed with absolute hunger & want of employment & his
daughter had gone to town to try & sell some nails - & he & his
wife had the sharp looks & pallid complexion of hunger. - I could
tell more, but these are instances enough of the poverty of the
poor here - I could not have thought it was so great - & I do not
wonder at their struggles. We were at [unclear]Marblardet[/unclear]'s exhibition of
automatons & were greatly pleased at the display of the wonderful
power of mechanism - wonderful to me because so ignorant
of its power. - but we were greatly displeased at the company
which was chiefly composed of the [underline]mobility[/underline] - it having grown
cheaper - we had endeavoured to make time to see it in the
reign of aristocracy - but our visits prevented. - Betsy was so kind

as to write to me the very evening she got to Clonmel - I wanted the
balm badly. - I wish you would not wait for the wedding dears, but
come so that I might return with you early in the summer - we
would be rejoiced to see you & my father & the girls join heartily
in the wish - Ah! do - sure you must be longing to see me. Please
give my love to Eliza - I hope her health continues good - & to Mary
Anne. I see no servant equal to Eliza & wish it may ever be
my lot to have such a [underline]friend[/underline]. I have not heard personally from
Ballitore this long time - I wonder you are so silent. I did not like
to write the last week I had Betsy - lest I should lose a moment
of what was so precious. - By Thomas's particular request I wrote
to his Sarah Godlee - an elaborate epistle you may judge. I would
not be surprised if Thomas came to Ireland for a few weeks,
but he is now so unsettled we scarcely know what he will do.
Dost thou be much in the garden, my darling D.? if I were near
thee I would make thee share every thing with me that we

too which were well executed as those who saw them, say - You
may imagine how we feel after Betsey she has left a great void
in our circle - the more perceptible that we are still busy grieving
for her, & so have not time to fill the vacuum in conversation wch.
her absence has left - My father is much [unclear]better to[/unclear] day, I hope for
his own sake & ours as well as for the luckless lovers that this fine weather
[deletion]b[/deletion] may be his restorative - Well Eben are you convinced by Hannah
Kilburn that it is not the best way to let the people take care of themselves -
she has convinced us all here of course & there is Lyd poking her head into
every hole & corner in the neighbourhood that contains a living christian
Verily to spy the nakedness of the land are ye come" - and the Joseph's of
the day had they the power would have scriptural authority for detaining
all these officious spies - Robert Owen is preaching away after his own
manner - so are we all led away by our own fancies - We met the patrol
last night when we were coming from Maillardet's & had we not been
of the aristocracy as our jaunting car [unclear][/unclear] we should have perhaps had no
comfortable lodging for the night - We had police to keep order at the exhibition
last night - We are growing like the Italians & Austrians, guns
& pistols bayonets & swords are to be seen on all occasions, the grand preservation

of social order -
and no doubt they
are very good things
I felt more confidence
last night in the
idea they were near
me - What have the
peacably disposed
to fear from them?
Heres an argument
for [unclear]Peclers[/unclear] - Set me
down as an Ultra
for the future -
But dear Debs I
ought to be saying
something to you -
about what? - first
that I long to see
you & that if you
do not come to us
we must soon go
to see you - I hope
we shall have you
hear in the fine weather,
that you may
be strong enough &
that I may shew
you what beautiful
is to be seen.
How do you amuse
yourself,
what are you doing,
who is entertaining
you or
what are you entertaining
yourself
with? I long to
hear all about
you my dear Debs
ah let us hear soon.
my dear Debs. I
am affectionately
yours & yours too
