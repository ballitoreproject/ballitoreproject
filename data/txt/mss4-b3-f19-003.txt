Ballitore: 30th/5th month 1779.


        While my dear Uncle receives such frequent addressed from his children, he may perhaps look upon me as guilty of neglect & ingratitude in never writing a line; me, whom his unmerited tenderness & affection encourages, to consider ^him^ as a Parent: if I was their equal I would not be outdone I should have written before if I thought I could produce any thing tolerable nor do I yet find I have a better opinion of myself but must write as I wish to avoid censure. It gives me great pleasure to hear that thou & my Aunt continue in good health & spirits, & that the time of your return approaches so near; it must be strange to my Aunt to be absent so long from home; in any other but such a good cause I fancy she could not endure it. Several boys are gone hom; Harper, Flood, Bunbury & Leslie SeniorLeslies Father has not yet determined what course of life he would have his son to follow; but seems willing to indulge his notion of going in the Army, by sending him to Dublin to learn to fence, dance &c. Smiths [sic] mother was greatly alarmed on the report of the French invasion, & wished to have her children about her: she wrote to them to be ready to come home at a minutes warning; in about a week after she sent a letter to console them for their disappointment, & to let them know she heard the French were better employed. Sherrard & Tom White are also gone to Dublin. Pray present my dear love to my Aunt & accept the same from
        Dear Uncle
                thy dutiful Nephew
                        William Rayner.
