dinner. Who should surprise
us and most agreeably but Aunt
Liddy and Uncle James, who came
out to dine and spend the evening
with us. It was [underline]very[/underline] pleasant

Poor Lilly was very weak after all

stay in bed now for awhile.
28 Monday - Another surprise to day!
for who should walk up just
as Papa was starting for town but
Aunt Elizabeth Cole, She had
come out by an early train
and [underline]actually[/underline] walked all the way
up from Bray - It was such
a rare thing for her to come out
to see us that we ought to make
much of her indeed.
While I was up dressing poor
weak Lid who should come
in just like a sun beam so
fresh and so cheerful but Florence
