My Dear sister
I just want to tel thee
that Hetty Routh has lainin of a
fine boy but poor thing she seems
in great wretchedness we send her
gruel every day the poor child was
very naked for she had nothing [insertion] to clothe it [/insertion] but
what thou gave her before thee
went till Mary Pike gave her a frock
& cap & I a shift & cap
Jemmy says thy carnations are
alive and that he will take care of
them and also dry the place for thy
gardin. Kitty James has lainin
in of a daughter Hannah they
thought she would have [insertion] died [/insertion] at
first but now she is in good
health and Kitty herself is finely,
Mick Timminoes wife has not lainin
yet but I believe she soon will.

Our Mary is not married indeed.
I hope thee will be home again on
thy birth day. James White
has got a new housekeeper &
her name is Teresa Heron she
breakfasts in the parlor and
dines in the hall.
Lydia White is in Carlow
at present I hope it may be
of use to her. Mary is there in
her place. Mary Davis said she
would write to thee if she had time
she sends her love to thee and so
does all the children. with as much as
all that put together from thy affectionate
sister yours Sarah
Elizabeth Leadbeater
