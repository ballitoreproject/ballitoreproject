Carlow 17th of 11th month 1799 -
Dear William,
I do not like to leave this place
without just mentioning that, an make some little enquiry here,
it plainly appears that what thou supposed to have been expressed
in the monthly meeting at large was not at all spokenof there, but
among the few heads of families who were asked to stop after -
perhaps thou wil't make use here of as justice & providence may
paint out, & I much desire you there & there here may carefully
guard against thinking hardly of each other - I have neither time
to enlarge, tho' much more might be said -
Publick meeting was held here this evening, appointed at
6 o'clock - I hope T.T & I will more hence in the morning
[unclear]u'll[/unclear] probably give thy
bror A.S a hint of the above
If he be under the impression
thou was't respecting it -
Afftly farewell
I. Abell
