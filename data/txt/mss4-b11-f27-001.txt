4th Sep - 1843.
Dear Mrs Cole
I am almost ashamed
not to have answered your
note sooner, but I have been
[underline]very[/underline] busy indeed - your
kind offer from Mr C - to
lend us a globe is truly
acceptable - & we hope to
take every care of it for you -
With respect to Ellen I
scarcely know what to say
She

she is so exceedingly self
willed, & rebellious at times
that I almost fear to
exert much authority
over her for I dread an
unequal contest before
the other children -
She requires, I think, my
peculiar management,
neither too severe nor too
gently; & yet a determinia
of manner & purpose

that she cannot mistake.
I made her learn every lesson
I had marked for her to day
to say, before I allowed
her home — she forgot
her work to day — the day
before your note reached
me, she had [underline]refused[/underline] to do
her work for Mrs Masks -
& I was rejoiced you did
write, for I had intended
either writing, or seeing you
myself about her, to have

from you the best way
to manage her - she is a
fine little girl, & it is [underline]worse[/underline]
than a pity to let her grow
up so idle, & sturdy -
If I could once hit upon
the [underline]true[/underline] way to controul
her all trouble would soon
be at an end - it is total
ignorance on this point that
has made the difficulty
hitherto - I must try still
to find out -
Your's [unclear]&c[/unclear]
S. A. Bagot
