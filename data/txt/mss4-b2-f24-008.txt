Clonmel 22nd of 1780 [sic]

My dear Father

	I confess I have really trespassed on thy patience in forbearing to answer thy last kind favour so long; yet the omission may ap^p^ear greater to thee than it is, I received thy long & very entertaining letter the 17 instant & the last date I perceive is 12th. I was visiting about a little this week, I dined one ^day^ at Brother Jos, & paid a morning visit to sister Hannah ^another day^, as one of her children was ill with a Worm-fever (they judged it to be) & those little matters of one kind or other occasion the days to pass swiftly over, without getting regularly thro ones business, & writing to you once a week is part of mine. John Helton [?] has in his possession (I suppose) a letter of mine to thee, as he fixed to leave us last fifth day was week, but thought the weather I apprehend too inclement for traveling: my Husband has got a cold, which confines him somewhat to the house, & thereby I enjoy a little more of his Society than usual, but I hope he will soon be restored to health, the Children well at present, as also my self; Abraham often talks of going to Ballitore to get books, yet he makes little or no progress in his Primer being very giddy & idle: he says he wont [sic] send his love to his Cousin Richard; but he will send a book to him.
	It is very pleasing to hear of my Aunt Fullers recovery my dear love is to her & my Cousins. I am pleased to find Cousin Abby Boake appears so hopeful in her disposition, it will be her own great advantage if she perseveres in this path for as thou justly remarks, it most certainly does & has made way for many in this life, where to Human reason there appeared no way. Thy description of E: H: is just what I should expect, I greatly fear (between thee & me) that poor Molly inherits some of her dispositions, & ^or^ perhaps imbibed them from education, I wish she may stick close to the right Guide, ^who^ makes his followers Conquerors. I suppose Nancy is the old way, her natural cast I think more steady: but I do not desire to judge, & wish I may not be uncharitable. We have now on a visit here to Molly Dudley a young Woman, who I think bears the right stamp, an example of solidity & plainness; her English dress is a good deal laid aside instead of her plated [?] cap, she has got a simple, thick Muslin-Mob with strings: I believe her change is from concern, & by the inwardness of her mind I trust she is growing in the root, & will be established on the immoveable [sic] foundation, I speak of Anna Taverner: I do not get as much of her company as I wish for.
	Thou hast a right sense of my situation, for considering the mixture that is in this cup of Life, I have indeed sweet domestick satisfactions, & they encrease; my dear Husband is affectionately kind to me, prefering [sic] my company to any other in this World, my little Children begin to be less troublesome, so that I have more assistance from my Servants, (whose conduct is very agreeable) our house is comfortable, & our circumstances easy, as this Year seems likely to be a profitable one in business, my Husband being very industrious in attending to it, & I have no trouble about the business, only just to take mind the pleasing, sweet employment of taking care of him, our children, & our little house & family: when our little ones are sick a cloud overcasts these enjoyments, but I believe those dispensations are also good to humble my mind, & ^they^ leave rather a sweetness behind em. When Sam & I are sitting by our fire side [sic] in the evenings by Candle light, we sometimes say, how pleased you would be to see us & our little ones, & lament that we can never you ^here^ select & comfortable to our selves, & that you cannot have an idea of our manner of Life, as you see us only in hurry. I am thus copious in my description, as thy remark introduced it, hoe it will be to your selves, not being at all fit for any but your own fire-side: & really my mind is at times bowed under a sense of those deserved favours I receive, yet sensible that disappointments are incident to this Life, I desire not to have my hopes [illegible] here, as all outward favours are insipid unless seasoned by the Divine blessing.
I am obliged to thee, also Samuel, for the paper relative to Thomas Colley: also to Betty for copying it, my love is to him, am pleased he is so agreeable to thee. I think Pat is silly, very like he is weary of sameness.
I heard of the sufferings of friends in Dublin, Robert Dudley, Brother Jos & almost all the friends (Jimmy Malones [sic], Uncle Bens) ^sufferings^ were vastly greater than what thou mentions of John Dawsons, the window sashes broke by frightful large stones, as if they wished to level the houses with the ground. Tom Lucas, Tom Chaylor & we escaped, no friend illuminated here we believe. Dick Danial [sic] is one of the independent Society, & was active (I suppose) in guarding us, threatening to stab the first that attempted ^to throw a stone^, but without our knowledge; Tom Chaylor & T: Lucas were I believe pretty [word crossed out] intimated with some of the Members of the Soci^e^ty; & they very like used their interest. ^Most of^ This Society & the Magistrates of the town behaved scnadalo^u^sly on the occasion
	I cannot help sending thee stragling [sic] scrawls, when I write much, therefore hope thou wilt excuse it, in thy dutiful & affectionate daughter

Sam wanted again to date my letter, but I would not let him make me again appear more careless than I was, as before I had desired him to date my letter
