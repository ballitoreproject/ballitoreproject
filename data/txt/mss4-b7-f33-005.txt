Philidelphia the 6 of 11 mo 1789
My dear Friend
I seem'd to want to write a few lines to my Dr
M:S but as thou knows well what apoor worthless creature I am
what can I say only we crossed the great & mighty ocean so far as
this city, & as it was great & mighty so it was great in affecting
contemplation & sometimes in communications between my Dear
Companion & I - not knowing at times whether we were to be food for
worms or fish which caus'd adeep searching of heart, one thing
that made it more desirable to be laid amongst one's friends
was the first storm we had which was [deletion]near[/deletion][insertion]about[/insertion] three [deletion][/deletion] weeks & a day
or too after we set under sail one of the passengers died in the midst
[unclear][/unclear] storm when the captain came down into the cabbin & told us
[unclear][/unclear] departed & departed without any of his companions knowing
any thing of it for some time, oh the shock it gave us this I
think was about 3oClock in the day & about eleven the next day
he poor creature was sew'd up in abag & abag of sand tied to his
feet I suppose inorder to sink him immediately which he did as they
told one some days after I never rose again think what an impression
this must leave on our minds, I believe it was a week or ten days
before I cou'd even ask about him it had such an affect so there was
one poor Body commited to the fish who did not [insertion]get[/insertion] a great deal of his
carcase as I believe he was in the last of a Consumpsion when
he left [insertion]Cork[/insertion], but thro the great kindness of providence we were favour'd
to get amongst our friends here who received with all the
kindness that was necessary for us to experience for which favour

we have partook of both by sea & land I hope to remember it with
an humble grateful heart if it may please infinite wisdom to
favour me with it as thou knows I can do nothing of myself but
when he sees meet to favour with ability, but now the mean
point is when we are favour'd with alittle ability do we do that
that he calls for at our hands & those he has favourd with many
talents do they occupy with them, according to his good pleasure
or to gratify themselves in things that may appear as innocent
as the doves that was to be wipt out of the temple, every thing
that in any degree obstructed his work, in the hearts of his [unclear]visled[/unclear]
children, but some that are possed of talents superior to others the
small discoveries of truth seems I fear so little & mean in their
eyes they are too willing to put them by not sufficient of [unclear][/unclear]
attention [deletion]attention[/deletion], now I believe this has been the case with many
that love the truth & is precious in their eyes, but this I have often
thought a great favour from the Almighty who by little discover
as they are attended too, how kindly does he lead them along least
great things might stagger them, I have thought something like
the Enemy, tho of so different anature, he tempts with little things
at first & gradually leads to greater, this thou has often known as
well as I, I have often wonderd at him how crafty he is & how wonderfully
he travels over sea & land he seems as if he had got to
America I & into the city of Philidelphia & here he seems to be
a citizian of no mean city not only so but in some places he seems
in great power I realy thought it his assurance was & in very great

that it was not enough for him to breed a general commotion almost all over the continent
but he must enter into the city to buy what mischief he can do in the city, I thought it
looked as if he intended to take up his winter quarters here amongst some of the
people & I am affraid he has imposed himself on some of the [insertion]youth[/insertion] sugesting to them
something that is like to carry away the mind either delucive pleasures vanities or
something, it seems as if he had as great a variety of [unclear]wares[/unclear] as was in Babylon I make
no doubt but he is governer there, & he has such an abundance of wares that he strives
all he can to dispose of them in cities & countries I am sure I wish the people were
more on their gaurd & not deal with him for I often think it leaves them very poor
& often times drives some to great distress, that is when they come to see how they
have spent & lavish'd away that - that they might have lived hansomely, on
I believe I had not better tire thee too much but strive to turn on something more
agreable after my Dr Companion bearing the Voyage to admiration & seem'd better &
livelier than I have seen her these years, she took a fit of illness I believe occasion'd
by a complaint she has been subject too & for something [insertion]I did not know[/insertion] how it wou'd terminate think
the situation poor me was in - in a strange land. but thro the great kindness of
providence she is now recover'd as well as usual & able to get out even so well that
I expect she will be able to wrestle [unclear][/unclear] all with him that has got possession of
too many places that is only the [unclear][/unclear] right -- I hope for this I may receive along
letter from thee be assured of it - its [unclear][/unclear] to hear from & of the family to whom
please present our very dear loves to dear Thos. Chanly & wife with the
Children Saml. Haughton & wife with all others that may enquire thine
