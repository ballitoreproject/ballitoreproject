Very unintentionally my beloved friend have
I been so long silent & thee [deletion]my[/deletion] thy many testimonies
of regard have been duly & gratefully
received. I have laboured under much debility
of mind & body - so as scarcely to feel
capable of performing the [unclear]easy[/unclear] days work
 which the very warm weather rendered increasingly
 oppressive -- our dear Barclay's
weakly state of health when he came from
school, was alarming - we had not received
the least intimation of his illness except the
impression which his meagre countenance
made on my perhaps too anxious mind
when we met him in Carlow - happily- Doctor
Dawe paid us a visit when we were exceedingly
puzzled respecting his treatment - he
seemed puzzled too but denied that we should
[insertion]try [/insertion] what rest from study - & indulging his fancy
in eating & drinking would do for him. This
mode of treatment has succeeded for beyond
our most sanguine expectations. his appetite
is now good - except for [underline]meat[/underline] he sleeps so well
that we are easy to part with him at night
to his own chamber, & I hope that he may
soon with safety attend James Worrall's school
for a afew hours each day - meeting his sisters
& brothers was really affecting particularly
little James who could not remember him
but we suppose imagined that dear Joshua
was restored to us - Barclay is exceedingly attached

to him, takes him before him on the [unclear][/unclear] & James
to him, takes him before him on the pony & James
frequently turns about & kisses him. This sweet
fellow was sadly bitten by the large dog - just as
we were about going to meeting on 6th day - the
favorite (tho' surly animal) snapt at him hard
and injured each finger so much that I sent
for Doctor [unclear]Burgess[/unclear] - who said that the joints [deletion][/deletion]
[deletion]that [/deletion] were not broken tho' the fingers were much
swollen - yet considerably reduced by [unclear]...ing[/unclear]
in warm soap & water - the frequent use of
which the Doctor considered the best remedy
he was sadly fretful for some days - [deletion]ha[/deletion]
so rejoiced [insertion]was he[/insertion] to see his father on his return from
Limerick that he turned away - lest he should
admire this infant too much - next morning
this sad accident happened -- we continue to
have very interesting letters from dear Sarah
whose talent for nursing the sick has not [unclear]lay[/unclear]
dormant even in England. our dear Aunt H. Pim
was alarmingly attacked with symptoms
of Apoplexy. Doctor Hancock was sent for in
the night - but he had left home for Ireland
- however his acquaintance Doctor Gordon
attended in his stead - much to my Aunts satisfaction -
he accounted for this seizure by her
[unclear]stoopping[/unclear] so much for several days in her
garden and not paying proper attention to
the state of her bowels -my Aunt Abigail
write that our Sarah becomes increasingly dear
to them. particularly to her invalid aunt. "her
adeptness in the different branches of [unclear]science[/unclear]
being quite remarkable." from the last letter
we suppose our travellers to have left London this
Mary Dudley [unclear][/unclear] had obtained certificates & [unclear]visit Pont[/unclear]
Mo. Meeting they with many others had left London for Ackworth general meeting
I have got a [unclear]fomenter[/unclear] - for thy [unclear]aching[/unclear] stomach such an application has thy
seemed to raise me from sinking - it is filled with boiling water - well corked
& covered with flannell - to the feet it is most comfortable when the bowels
are pained

morning in a four coach for Gloucester. Susanna
Carter & Mary Simmons of the party. they had
[deletion]some[/deletion] expectation of reaching Milford next 7th day
Sarah spent some time with our ever kind
friends at Rivington. now Grizzle Birkbecks [insertion]establishment[/insertion] - in
her coach they visited the docks a few days
since - were aboard a vessel of 13 hundred ton
burden -- Sarah was delighted with her visit
to Hampton court & other fresh places"
