Waterford: 4th of 10th month 1780.


My dear Uncle,


        I hope thou wilt excuse me for not writing before as Owen could have informed thee of our pleasant Journey & safe arrival. I had acquainted Pat by letter with the time I expected to arrive at Waterford in consequence of which he was at the river-side to receive me
After dinner he conducted me to William Penroses who treated me very civilly I have been in the Office all day (except meal times) & hope by degrees I shall be initiated into the business. A Balfour was obliged to go home this evening pretty early on account of a pain in his back occasioned by sitting too constantly at the desk I am at present very comfortably situated in his family until Pat has got some necessary repairs in the house he has taken He expects to remove in 8 or 10 days 
Since I came here I heard with very great concern that James Gough was taken dangerously ill (with a bloody flux if I mistake not) & was not expected to live. I hope I shall profit by the good advice thou & my Aunt so kindly imparted & may be enabled to keep from acting in any manner that would lessen me in your opinion. ^(5th 10 month)^ Betty Gregory is here something better in her health than the account we had in Ballitore she drank tea at A Balfours this evening. I understand she designs to sail in the next vessel for Bristol which is expected to go next week. Peggy Christy I understand has left Waterford this morning I did not see her Isaiah Gough I hear is something better. I have not time to enlarge as the Post will be soon going out. I beg to be particularly & affectionately remembered to my Aunt Cousins & all the familyI am dear Uncle,
        thy dutiful Nephew
                William Rayner.
