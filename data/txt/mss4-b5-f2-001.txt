My dear Molly - if thoull bear being call'd so by an old insignificant
batchelor- I had been thinking lately, & thought of letting thee so,
that, by one means or other, I had, more or less, corresponded with most
of your family but thyself- It was not, nor is not, from a fondness
for letter-writing, or an increase of it, that I venture anything to thee in
that way for I think the contrary is the Case, but having miss'd an
opportunity, with [deletion][/deletion] civility & gratitude once put in my hands,
I would, I fear, be chargeable with the want of both (the latter
is what I dread most) if I omitted the present occasion for endeavoring,
at last to make my Sister's acknowledgment acceptable to thee-
As "sorry a scrawl" as, in they own estimation, thy letter might be
I believe thou could hardly have pleased or gratified her more [deletion][/deletion]
than by writing when & as thou did, notwithstanding, as I expected,
it open'd, & caused her wound to bleed afresh- She was not wanting
in attachment to thee before, but this Seems to have hid an additional knot-
in attachment to thee before, but this Seems to have tied an additional knot-
I wish to guard against anything like idolizing the subject, lest thou might
be the appearance, [unclear]o[/unclear] the reality of that Monster [underline]Self[/underline], but, to speak the truth,
I think I never saw so compleat a representation of unaffected grief
as my Sister exhibits: and at the same time that both my judgment &

my

my experience lead me to condemn an extreme, wch. may have too much
the [insertion]appearance of[/insertion] revolt, I am, as it were, sorry & [underline]not[/underline] sorry at [deletion]this[/deletion] beholding what I do
for, what can be more disgusting, than an unfeeling mind & conduct?
Asking thy excuse for saying so much on the Subject, I am desirous not
to lost time in relieving your anxiety concerning thy [underline][insertion]our[/insertion][/underline] friend EB's relation-
[unclear]Thesson[/unclear] who was crushed in [insertion]the ruins of[/insertion] that melancholly accident, besides a man
The person who was crushed in [insertion]the ruins of[/insertion] that melancholly accident, besides a man
& his wife, was, I apprehend, a little old man, call'd Capt. Nagle, who
had gone (whats term'd) round the world with Adml. Anson- The foremention'd
unfortunate couple left eight orphans, wch, together with
its' being so singular & affecting a Case, naturally & properly excited
the feelings of the publick, & to the credit of this City & its' neighbourhood,
there was in a short time upwards of Â£900 raised on the occasion
Be so kind to tell my friend Abram, that whether the debt be ever
discharged or not, we [deletion][/deletion] hold ourselves much indebted to him for so
kindly & suitably writing with thee in that act of sympathy & friendship-
I am unequal to writing to you both (properly) at the same time, neither
do I know whether it would find him at home- unless Lydia's Situation
prevents, [unclear]Shou'd[/unclear] think he'd be likely to[unclear][/unclear] to our qutly meeting-
I am kept at home this time, however am left behind- the best reason
or excuse, tho' I cou'd mention others, is Sister Abby's affecting Situation-
I

I have not heard a word from thy Father Since he came into this
province, except thro' the medium of N. Jacob, who sent me a very
kind invitation to take Share of thy Father's bed- I suppose, as usual,
he'll come to Clonmel after the meeting & Spend a few days there
I see no more of our dear friend Samuel Neale than you do,
owing the Smallpox being so long continu'd in this house, but all
accounts agree concerning his amendment- you may probably hear
more particularly by this conveyance from E Penrose. He has lately
had a long letter from John Pemberton written at Carlisle-
I apprehend it does not say much, if any thing, concerning his future
prospects- suppose he & others are attending the Qrtly meeting at Leeds
about this time- Hast thou heard of our letter getting to R. Jones's hand?
I have, as usual, seen this out beyond [insertion]what[/insertion] seem'd needful, yet Shall
not lengthen it unnecessarily by an empty apology- Do please to accept
& present to thy Mother, our united, affectionate Salutation, with dear
love to Sally, Abram & Lydia- I am, dear Molly, Thine in Sincerity
Here's a feast for Sally that came since
writing the above- there seems to be some
mistake about EP's letter -
