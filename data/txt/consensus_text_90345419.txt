enjoyment notwithstanding this
dissappointment as Uncle Manliffe
brought me with Aunt Martha, to
see the firing from the Edinburgh
It was a lovely morning and
numbers were assembled on the East
Pier to see the sight. They kept
us waiting for nearly two hours
but as there was some variety in
the scene, we bore it very patiently
At about 12 they commenced firing
at the targets - which were placed
far outside the harbour and the
noise was deafening, unpleasantly loud
what must it be in a battle!
A mock fight between the boats
of the man of war and a pilot vessel
followed and was a novel spectacle
to Aunt Martha and me.
In the evening Aunt M accompanied
Uncle Manliffe on the piano and
the cornopian sounded very sweet
in deed.
