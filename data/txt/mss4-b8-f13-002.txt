Waterford 26th of 4th Month 1824
My Dear Elizabeth
Your kindness furnished us with a high
heat, in the purusal of the annals of Ballitore
which we have gone thru, and I propose returning
tomorrow by M. Richardson. With some parts I was
quite delighted, and my mother not less gratified.
but I shalt let her speak for herself as I expect she
will furnish one with a particular message.
- it will give thee much pleasure to see M: R on
the road to Dublin accompanied by her valued father
his indisposition soon subsided- Marys visit has I
believe been very beneficial & cheering to him & the prospect
of his attendance of the quarterly & Yearly Meetings gives
his friends much satisfaction - & we may anticipate that
mingling a little with his friends & taking an active
part in the affairs of society, will have a tendency
to dispel the gloom which seems to have enveloped
him, since the privation of his old & faithful companion -
thou knows his reserved unsocial habits, & sitting
much alone in his own dwelling he must continually be
sensible of his loss - My dear Mother has remained
much of an invalid since I before addressed thee
tho' so far recruited as to get to the pasture, and
twice to ride out but a fresh seizure of her feet
has again confined her - to her bed & chamber however
-over

the pain having abated. Stiffness & weakness only remains
I expect she may be able to hobble to the drawing room
tomorrow - & trust this will prove the finishing attack
for the present & that in a little time she will be
able to resume her usual habits . - by long confinement
her frame is become so tender it seems almost impossible
to guard her from Cold - She never appeared to
have any view of attending the Yearly Meeting in
Dublin want of sight added to other infirmities rendering
the undertaking too formidable but She had
hoped to get to Clonmel & her prevention has been no
small disappointment to herself & greater perhaps
to me - as I had fondly anticipated that She, thy dear
Aunt Grubb, & cousin S:G might once more have been together
at a quarterly meeting & together advocated that cause
to which they are all, even in advanced life so closely bound
but it was otherwise ordered - Cousin Grubb had most kindly
written two letters, conveying details of their proceedings
gives an animated account of thy aunt Margarets
ministering on seventh day in the select Meeting,[unclear] with[/unclear]
thousands could have heard her breaking forth in praise
of the Merciful creator of good - being accustomed from
childhood to attend our general meetings - I shall
feel on various accounts the privation of this satisfaction
but [underline]most sensibly[/underline] the cause of my dear Mothers absence
increasing age & infirmities - I often remember our last
I expect thou recollects the day we spent at [unclear][/unclear]. I shall
cherish the remembrance as the last past in the company of our
beloved friend R. S.

visit to Ballitore - her mind was much attracted
towards you - & perhaps it may prove [insertion]indeed it has already done so[/insertion]a final parting
with some she long loved and valued - of thy
dear Mother we have not heard particularly since
thy letter came to hand but would gladly hope
as she then appeared gaining some ground & a
[unclear][/unclear] genial season approaches she may gradually
recruit, her mental exertion & sedentary habits have
not been conducive to health - since writing the last
word we have had a visit from Joseph Strangman &
Mary, the latter tells me she has received a letter
from thee that no material change appeared to have
taken place in thy Mother & that thy sister Lydia
has had a fever since her return to Limerick from
which she is recruiting. - My mother was pleased
to hear of thy Aunt Shackleton's recovery and renewed
ability to resume her accustomed Labours in the garden
&c so Conducive no doubt to health and longivity to
whom she requests her kind love may be given & also
that acknowledgment may be made to thy dear Mother
on her behalf for her ready compliance is sending
the Annals- - not less valued for being in her own hand
writing; the earlier parts were particularly & interesting
bringing into fresh remembrance dearly beloved & honoured
friends whose virtues they so strikingly portray - &
whose tender kindness to her in various respects recollection
still gratifully cherishes as exceedingly precious.

many of the facts recorded with the accompanying remarks she
deems very instructive and some particular incidents remarkably
so- she hopes that her loved friend thy valued mother if
consistent with unerring wisdom, may be permitted to regain
her health - the decision is in better hands than ours & be the
event as it may, she trusts that he who was her morning
light & has measurably preserved thro many vicissitudes by the
sweet influences of his love will continue to sustain under
every conflict to the end, remaining to be her evening long.
She unites in Saluting her affectionately - thy self and
aunt Sarah in whose memory my mother still wishes
to hold a place - tho it is not probable they will
ever again [underline]see[/underline] each other in mutability - Farewell
my dear Elizabeth - from a fellow feeling, in the present
I cause of [insertion]thy[/insertion]anxiety & care. I can truly subscribe myself
thy sympathising & affectionate friend J Watson
a few more words from my mother expressive of regard for thy brothers
cousins Richard & Elizabeth Shackleton to whom she wishes thee to convey
her love feeling it freshly to flow in her heart towards them to John
Davis & Mary. also to thy father.
Elizabeth Leadbeater
