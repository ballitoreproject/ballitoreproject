My dear Eliza
I suppose thou hast
care & trouble enough with
thy housefull of noisy children
it is rather an arduous task.
Has there been any other account
from Sarah [unclear]on[/unclear] when
will she release thee. poor
Lydia I hope there is [deletion][/deletion] better
news of her she must have
been very ill & I suppose is
so still. Thou did not write
to me since thou went to Britain
St & I know nothing of
thy doings I suppose thou art
mostly confined to thy charge.
We were at meeting to day a
damp close dirty day. yesterday

was beautiful like summer
& had a delicious feel. Haliday
was here, he said he did his
best but that it took him
as long to tune this as he
would do three others. I have
taken off the old silk &
hope I can fix the new so as
to look well. if there were
mahogany handles got for
the front board instead of the
shabby old brass ones that are
in it, it would also look better
We are[deletion][/deletion] to dine out at R's today,
is not that extraordinary
of a first day, it is however a
little variety. I have just
been handed thy note & will
send in the things as soon as I
can I wish Sarah was come
home for I am afraid of thy
being overdone. Will Edward
stay long I suppose not, what a
pity thou could not have
gone to see them. I am very
sorry it happened as it did
with respect to Patty
but perhaps it is all
for the best, perhaps
if she had gone it might not
have answered as well as we
could wish I think the worst
of it is Lucy's disappointment
the thought of it would have
been so pleasant to have her
with dear love I am thy
affectt sister Selina
