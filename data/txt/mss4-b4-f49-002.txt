Dublin the 5th 12 mo 1786.
Dear Friend
Agreeable to thy request I take up the pen to inform
that we were favoured to get well to town early yesterday
afternoon, that is just after 3 o'clock, had a very fine day,
which appeared before the Moon went down - My Husband
finds a difference in the air, as to breathing, when out of the
house - but must do as well as he can with it, it's like.
A: Shannon was enquiring for you, I told thou wished
some information respecting her purposed engagement; she
said she had sent word by Molly what she then could,
to communicate when there was leisure; but that since that
time there was a proposal of a partner made to her,
which she thought would be agreeable to us all; one
who had thoughts of it & of her for a Companion these
two years past, but desired it should not transpire
for some time - So I can't tell who - but I set to guess
& mentioned one, to whom I made some objection; she said it was
was

other - [insertion]said[/insertion] she had a very good Husband, & thought she was fully
equal to either department, the House-keeping or Tuition - [insertion]this[/insertion] &
A: S. seeming fully fixed on Mt.melick as to Place, set me
to think [insertion][underline]conclude[/underline][/insertion] it was Cousin M: Bewley - but didnot get [insertion](nor expect)[/insertion] an answer,
as she was confined to secrecy- -
The Wedding was Solemnized this day, the Meeting quiet,
Sarah Newland & Joseph Williams assisting in Counsel-- -
They think little John Bewley better--- - The sore on William
Pike's Leg seems near ready to be opened - John Robertson,
the old Scotch Taylor, deceased at Friends Poor-house.
Ought I to make some apology for intruding my
speech the other evening, when the matter was better spoken
to before? - The best I can make is my Love to the dear
young folks, & a desire which I feel, that not even such
[insertion]things [/insertion]as are thought or deemed Lawful, or Innocent, as [insertion]conversation [/insertion]not hurting
others, or perhaps sometimes admiring the beauty of expressions,
writings &c. might too much engross the attention &
take
was not her & accounted as if she must not answer as to any

 take off from the necessary [underline]watch[/underline], & from that [underline]inward seeking[/underline]
to which would be granted [underline]the favour to find[/underline] - O, that
we may indeed seek with such sincerity as may be acceptable,
& watch against every pleasing thing that would divert us
 from application about things of a [deletion]permanent[/deletion] [insertion][underline]permanent[/underline][/insertion] nature; my
mind is often bowed for Abraham, that he may do just
[underline]right[/underline]; & then I believe a Blessing will attend
may be very useful; but I seem to see necessity of great
 watchfulness, as well as humility, that these great [deletion]parts[/deletion] [insertion][underline]Parts[/underline][/insertion]
[insertion]which he is endued with[/insertion] may be sanctified - I love him as a Brother, already an
elder Brother, yet fear because of danger -
I wish the Young Man W: L. very well - sometimes
some come among us having a particular liking & affection
to some particular [insertion]person[/insertion] - I don't know that this is his
case, but I think it requires some care to look into
matters of this sort, that the motive may be perceived -
excuse the freedom taken in thus remarking -
My Husband joins in dear Love to our Friends at
Ballitore, with Thy sincerely Affectionate Friend Elizth Pike

Having [insertion]read &[/insertion] sealed the letters, I sent them to H. Piper, who expected to
sail soon - My Husband sends two fishes, desires your acceptance
of them, or dividing with Abraham as seemeth best - If
Lydia be still up, one might be sent, if confined then perhaps he'd eat
[insertion]of them[/insertion] at your Table -
Elizabeth Pike to E:S.
