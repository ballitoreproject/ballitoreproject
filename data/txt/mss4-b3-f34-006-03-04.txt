Ballitore: 22/11 month 1787.


My dear friend,


        I have been looking into the account current of the correspondence between thee & me, & I do not find but that I had the last word with thee in this way: I believe I thought it was otherwise, when being ^long^ from home lately I often remembered some of thy last expressions to me, which implied a request that I would write to thee while abroad  I remembered, but I could not well compass to comply  Close travelling, & exercise of mind & body rendered it in a manner impracticable. I believe those who were appointed to visit ^the service of visiting^ the meetings of discipline, whatever qualification they might want beside, went forth under a deep sense of their own impotence, & comparatively-small measure of religious experience: I believe also that they are ^were^ helped along by a little of best help, enabled from season to season to act for the Master, & on behalf of his church, with some degree of acceptance & propriety, & preserved from doing much harm. Our ministers I hope ministered of the ability for the time being afforded [sic], & were often as a flame of fire  kindling that sacrifice in prepared spirits, which the Lord Almighty does in no wise despise: the other servants were pretty careful I trust, not to launch out of their proper depth  so we went on harmoniously, & very cordially, finding a very kind, personal reception among our friends, & have cause to think, that, though honestly & plainly dealt with, they were pleased & well satisfied with the visit. For my part: my chief labour seemed to be a deep, inward, silent travail of spirit for the promotion of pure & genuine Christianity among men: I thought, & think it great pity that a Religion [page number] 126 which the Son of God himself, in the fulness of time, & at the close of all previous dispensations, came down to establish on earth; a Religion which he introduced into the world, in order that mankind might thereby be made happy here & hereafter; a Religion which he taught by precept & example, confirmed by miracles, & sealed with his precious blood, shed under most excruciating tortures: I say I think it great pity, & great abomination that the profession of this pure & holy Religion should, like other professions in civil life, be made a paltry trade of, & subservient to the purposes of avarice, pride & vain-glory. My soul is also at time sorrowful that that holy flame, rekindled by divine Power in the hearts of our predecessors of the last century, after a seeming extinction for many ages, should now burn so faintly & dimly, & appear to be in danger of going out again among us. May I solemnly say, God forbid! for indeed He alone can forbid & prevent  & may we, my dear friend, individually watch & be sober  watch & take heed to ourselves, lest we should at any time be entrapped, & enter into the temptations of an insidious adversary, practising on the remains of corruption in us  be sober, solid & deep in our dwelling, that we may be preserved from being intoxicated at any time with the fumes of our own imagination, but being religiously temperate & clear, may be preserved favoured to see our several lots & services, to step quietly into them, & having done or suffered according to the divine will, to the best of our understanding, may refer ourselves & the whole of our conduct to Him that sees & judges rightly.
