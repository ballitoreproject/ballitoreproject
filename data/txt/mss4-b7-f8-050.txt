Waterford Eleventhmonth 28th 1799
I received my dear Cousins' acceptable Letter & present
which I assure thee is highly valued by Eliza - she
frequently sues for the privilige of spelling in the book
she got from her Cousin for she can as yet do no
more - she has gone to School for several months
& seems to be dextrous at her needle: she has not completed
her fifth year but is a stout lump. The next
on the list is Sarah, rather delicate whose only accomplishment
is an astonishing volubility of tongue
which is at times entertaining enough: her age exceeds
two - The last made her appearance on this
transitory stage nearly three months since & in [unclear]memorial[/unclear]
of our early friendship enjoys the name of Mary
she appears in a thriving condition: but this inveterate
distemper the Small pox hangs threatning over the
heads of the two latter I have no objection to their
being inoculated, but the mother's apprehensions incline
her otherwise. A fine promising young woman was taken

off from our neighbourhood a short time ago, attacked
by the disorder of the confluent sort - her name was
Deborah Butler. There was something remarkable in
her case - a family of 6 or 7 were newly recovering
from the small pox in or near Mountmellick which
was announced to her by Letter - one might be led to
suppose the contagion was communicated - however
she had it more unfavourably than her brothers & sisters
& fell a victim. Another brother an apprentice in this
city was inoculated a few days since. Sally's stay in
England has been long: is it in a public capacity
for the intire time or is she detained by the invitation
of some acquaintances I think it was well
for her not to be a witness of the unpleasant
scenes that were represented to your view.
I hope the purchase of Timber has proved beneficial:
'tis certain the value of Foreign Timber has
increased enormously. Please present me affectionately
to all Friends. My Wife joins me in best wishes for
thee & them
I am thine sincerely
Wm Rayner
