My dear Elizth
I have at last, with the Doctor's approbation
concluded on accepting my father's & thy kind invitation
& we settled on 7th day next as being
the most convenient to us for going, we purpose
posting to Naas if my father could send his chaise
to meet us there thou sees I make very free in asking
this & will expect to be told so as freely if it be inconvenient
another thing I have to leave to thyself whether
I shall or shall not bring Rose down to take care
of Margaret she sleeps by her bedside at present but
as soon as I'm able I intend to take her to my self I would
like to do whatever is most agreeable to all parties at
home respecting this I hope a great deal from my
visit I suppose my mother has left you before this
Didst thou get the starch? Edw intends to accompany
us, please say whether the Scarletina be entirely
removed from the school &c &c I would be very

glad to get a letter by return of post saying if I
may go & answering the numerous questions
John is finely & I believe is to go to the country on 6th day
thy affecte Sister S Barrington
