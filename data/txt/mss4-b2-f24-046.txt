My dear Father,


        Thro favour of kind Providence we fared better than might be expected from the weather when we left you; we got safe to Carlow; at the house of our kind friend Samuel Haughtons, we dried & refreshed ourselves, & proceeded to Royal-Oak, where we did the same, it rained I think the heaviest whilst we were under shelter at each place, for the evening proving pretty fair & light we got pleasantly into Kilkenny in good time, & after a good nights rest, reached nine mile house to breakfast, & home to dinner, where we found all well except Samuel being a little hoarse; we find that our friends here are mostly pretty well, except poor Josiah, who continues in a very doubtful state, & I understand it seems most likely that he does not recover. I think it a great favour to get well home to a comfortable habitation, & to find them all so well, & greatly desire to be assisted also, to keep in the quiet habitation, for all the enjoyments of this life lose their relish, except they are possessed under some sense of the blessing being in, & upon them, I look back with sensations of gratitude to thy kind & tender care of, & patience with me, who have many infirmities to struggle with which are sometimes trying to myself & others [sic]. I shall wish to hear of you all at both houses, how thy eyes & cough are, & my Mothers hand, if you hear of any thing of Cousin Molly Bewley, or Jonas Stotts child (that was sick) I would be obliged for the information, also of Anna Taverner. 
        I dont [sic] find I have much to write about, but thought you would like me to let you know of our getting finely home, & being well: Molly Phillips says she sent Richard two pair of worsted stockings by Barcroft Haughton, please to enquire if they got them:
        Our dear love is to you all as if named, thee & Mother in particular, I could have liked to have had more of her company, but it seems as if home was our proper place now.
        I hope sister Lydia excused my not going over to see the night I was at Ballitore as it was late & wet, my dear love is to her. Cousin Nancy Grubb desires her dear love to you
        I remain thy dutiful & affectionate daughter
                Margaret Grubb
