From the same to the same

My dear Cousin,
	+++ I am glad our poor child was so agreeable to you there. I am pleased that we let her go with you. The hand of an infinitely wise & gracious Providence saw meet (I believe) to unite the hearts of the Parents with the holy cement of his pure love, & I trust it is the same condescending goodness that a friendship is formed among our children. -- May we of the retiring generation be happily continued objects of divine regard & compassion & be [page #] 83 endued from season to season with fresh supplies of heavenly wisdom, that so we may walk in & before our families with propriety, & leave such vestiges, in all parts of our conduct, as our successors may safely follow. -- And may our beloved offspring & their connexions having been favoured to see a glimpse of the beauty which is in the Truth, dwells low in humble, & watchful fear, that this eye may ever be kept open in them, that the vision may be more & more cleared & extended, & the god of this world never be permitted to close, or obscure with the dust of the earth or dazzle & dim with worldly splendor! I am anxious for the coming forward of the youth of our day: something or other retards their growth -- with divers it is not any criminal evil disposition, any criminal pursuit: but I fear there is a want of steady, solid, diligent waiting for the renewal of those baptisms which purge the soul, & prepare it for further illuminations & discoveries of duty. -- There is a seeking & desiring after Good, & a looking towards the servants & messengers, & expecting from them: but if, under a sense of our wants & weaknesses, our attention was more immediately turned towards the Master himself, & our dependence more abstractedly fixed upon him, I believe there would be more of a growing in the root, the tender plant would soon become a tree of righteousness, & fruit would be brought forth in due season grateful to God & man.
	Thy last letter, my dear cousin, was forwarded to me to Clonmel, where I was visiting my children & grandchildren. ++ my principal delay there was the family-visit at Clonmel & Garryroan-side, in which I was requested to join, & thought it best to encourage the service, as I happened to be there, Benjamin Grubb, John Grubb, Robert Dudley & wife, & William Fennell were principals on the visit -- I think a degree of best help was afforded, & it was generally performed (I believe) to good satisfaction. [page #] 84 I was much taken with Benjamin Grubbs manner; it was instructive, exemplary & edifying to me-- He left the world & its business (of which he has a considerable share) to his hopeful children & servants, & set himself earnestly & diligently ^steadily^ about this business, ran about here & there, ^ar-^anging, appointing, & giving notice to families, to suit their convenience & save time. When we sate down with a family, he generally opened the way (after a previous time of solid waiting) by letting them know it was an opportunity of religious conference by appointment of their meeting of discipline, & proceeded to recite the substance of some of the most important of the Quarterly Meetings Queries, one after another, to which answers were sometimes severally given, & occasion taken to make remarks, give advice, &c. as seemed suitable. Benjamin is in the church much as he is in the world -- he is an honest, upright, downright man, deals upon his own stock, affects to be nothing but what he really is, speaks his mind, plainly & simply, & is more in substance than in show. Mary Dudley appeared at times most beautifully amongst us -- it was the beauty of holiness indeed -- than which nothing is more splendidly excellent. ++++ In this tour we met with dear M.W: I have long & often felt near friendship for her, & thou may well think her present situation did not make her less dear to me. Affliction, by melting down, seems to write friends & mingle their spirits more intimately, as fire dissolves metals & causes them to incorporate in one mass. ++++ thy affectionate friend
