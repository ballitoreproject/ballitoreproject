Your Note, my dear Mrs Leadbeater,
is so like every thing I have received from
you- so full of kind attention, that I
now almost regret the having made
any complaint, but I was vex'd at the
moment to find my request so totally
unattended to - We are far from wishing
to circumscribe the little pleasures of the
young People, or any Friends of yours;
but it would be pleasant that the [underline]former[/underline]
sho.d be accompanied by some one who
could restain any little mischevious
propensity they might feel - & that we
might know that the [underline]latter[/underline] had your
consent & for I really believe many come
without your knowledge - yrs very sincerely
JH
