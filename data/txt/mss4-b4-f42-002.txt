My dear Mother,
thee, I never hear that thou complains, good nature
& tender forbearance are often imposed no, I may ackowledge
the receipt of my Father's kind letter by J: Wood,
I was pleased to hear you had so favourable a journey
to & from Dublin, & that thou received no injury to thy
health therefrom, this weather is uncommon for the Season,
a gloomy stormy time perhaps is portended by
the elements, may we experience having shelter in
a spiritual sense, as thro' mercy we do in an outward,
should we be tried [insertion]with[/insertion] calamitous times; indeed the
very present time is distressing, trade so stagnated,
the poor are incapable of supplying their urgent wants
by their industry, we have not one comber at work
now, nor cannot sell the yarn already made up,
we have one of the lodging rooms stuffed with it, the
poor spinners also in great misery: this is touching
to a heart possessed of a degree of the tender feelings
of [insertion]pity &[/insertion] humanity. My Father writes that [insertion]the[/insertion] meeting was
low, but not uninstructive, low times are often
attended with instruction, & are often succeeded by
It is long since I addressed a letter to
Peace

Peace, if we patiently [insertion]&[/insertion] faithfully abide under the
dispensation, in this I am sensible of dificiency.
I was glad to read my Father's account of dear sister
Sally John, & Cousin Betsy, I long to see them, &
the nearer the time approaches, the more I feel my
heart warmed with the flame of a pure friendship,
which I hope will never expire; I was glad to
hear of the intimacy between Betsy & Lucy, I trust
they are kindred spirits, & will be preserved in a state
wherein the unity of spirits & communion of Saints are
experienced; I thought it seemed to animate me,
by a remembrance of times that are past, & excite
fresh emotions & desires to be of that number.
I remark about poor E: Hutchinson & daughter,
please give my kind love to Molly, may she hold
fast the precious, inestimable visitation of Heaven!
quietness & inwardness I believe to be the best soil
for such young plants to grow in, out of that hour
for such young plants to grow in, out of that how
insecure, how weak are the most highly favoured
visited young people: the Enemy I believe strives to
visited young people! the Enemy I believe strives to
allure out of that, in order to take advantage; know
allure out of that, in order to take advantage; know[insertion]ing[/insertion]
that in "quietness & confidence shall be our strength."
I have wrote uncommonly free to my dear Mother
matter

[insertion]matter[/insertion]
occurred & so I set it down, under a sense of my
unworthyness to handle the subject, but I hope it
goes in simplicity, & in the freedom of near affection,
tho' I am sure I had no thought of entering
on it when I begun, & hope always to hold the
theme sacred; & never make it a subject for want
of another, [insertion]but[/insertion] rather let my nakedness & barrenness
appear. I am concerned to find my poor Aunt is
so ill, I wish her relief, & sympathize in some degree
with her, if she had Abraham now I think
he would afford her some entertainment, thro' mercy
he is bravely, looks well, eats hearty, & is coming
finely to his feet, sleeps well almost all night.
Henry better than he was.
I have been consulting many about the best
road for thee to come, & the general voice is for
thy coming to 9 mile house from Kilkenny by
Kells, & not to go by Darrow & Cashel, as the
rode from Cashel here is very bad, & they
say by going a little round by Kells, & not going
thro' Callen, thou may miss all the bad road
except a few miles bad after leaving 9 mile house
& the rest to Clonmel excellent good, perhaps a
car might be got at 9 mile house to take thee
over

over the worst of the road; if the day was fair, thou
could alight & ride that way over the bad spots.
I hope thou wilt let us know soon thy determination
& what day thou intends to set out, the sooner thou
comes on my account the better, as the latter part
of next week my time will be out. I am not insensible
of your affectionate solicitude on my account.
My Husband joins me in dear love to you all as
if particularized.
Clonmel 14th of 5th mo: 1778
Am thy dutiful & affectionate
daughter Margt. Grubb

health
