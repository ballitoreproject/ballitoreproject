Papa went to town this morning but did
not come out yet. I had a letter
from Margt. telling me that Aunt Liddy
was ill, a billious fever, but they were
not alarmed about her. Elizabeth continues
improving. This seems to be unhealthy
weather. The cholera is in Bray and
many complain of various maladies.
Poor Doctor Leney was very ill of pleurisy
I think, but is better now.
31st.. The last day of the old year
