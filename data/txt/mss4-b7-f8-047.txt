Waterford Eleventhmonth 15th 1790
My dear Cousin
I received thy distressful account of your
situation & truly sympathize with you — If thou & thy
children or any part of the family would chuse to spend
the Winter in Waterford I have two spare apartments
at your service & should be well pleased with your company.
It gratified me much to learn than Cousin Abraham
was ignorant of the poor Docters fate of which I have taken
care to inform those who spoke on the subject.
I expect thou hast ere now received the Letter I wrote
on Moeneys affair which I forwarded by Timy. Connolly
an inhabitant of Carlow addressed to the care of
Saml. Haughton there & by whom I purpose these
few lines — thro' forgetfulness he delayed the delivery
for some time — Thou wilt learn by said Letter that
I am pretty well Master of Mooneys affair — I intend
not

not to neglect it when the Newfoundland [unclear]Vepress[/unclear] arrive
before that period nothing can be done. There have been
some robberies committed in the neighbouring County of Kilkenny
not far from this town. Thomas Layle has a Mill at
the distance of about two miles from this city — his
House adjoining was broken open & entered by a set of
men who robbed his manager there of his watch & about
7 Guineas belonging to TL — threatened the young man
with horrid usage but did him no great violence — It is
to be hoped these desperadoes will not be permitted to
go on much longer. I have made inquiry respecting
Mich: Whelan he & his family are in good health —
he has an employment of permanent Watchman at the
Bridge & also a share in a small boat which he
hires & works — I believe he & his wife are industrious
I expect Pat Rogen & his family are in health I saw
him a few days since & communicated part of thy
Letter he was greatly affected — Becky joins me in
earnest wishes for your future tranquilly — Present me
affectionately to all at home Thine sincerely Wm Rayner

A few days since George Penrose has lost his wife
She left behind three small Children.
