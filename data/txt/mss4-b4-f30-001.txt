Dear Susy - When we think of such a Woman
dying - the mind recoils at the thought, the
inquisitive mind follows her soul, released from
the dross of earth; strains its' sight to behold her
mount into superiour regions, rejoiced to meet
its' kindred spirits - What wholesome reflections
such events produce - What an inducement to
be virtuous -
I will not dare to check thy
sacred Sorrow
Time but the impression stronger makes
As tides their channels deeper wear -

Extract from
Ebenezar S -
to Susy Bewley
on the death of her
Sister Mary
