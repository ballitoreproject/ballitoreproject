Norwich 25th 3rd month 1783.


My Dear Cousin,


        Thy letters do at all times give me sincere pleasure, but I am particularly obliged by thy remembrance of me, so much sooner than I had been able to demonstrate my attention to thee; I have now been much more dillatory [sic] than I could have wished, but my endeavours to be as much as possible with my friend Gurney during her tedious confinement, did in great measure occupy those that used to be my leisure hoursshe has now got down stairs, her little Richard (so far) is every thing a fond mother could desire, but like thy Lydia she is deprived of the gratification of supplying his wants herself
        Yes! my Cousin Deavess was indeed a distressing situation, poor Woman! her sons do not prospect as though they would give her much satisfaction, I have not seen Thomas since he was a child, but I think I have heard a better account of him than the rest
I understand that her ^Dinahs^ conduct meets with general approbation, which I am heartily glad of, when we were children I loved ^her^ most intimatelyDeath has indeed made rapid innovations in the circle of our acquaintance remarkably amongst the Youth the sudden removal of my dear and amiable friend Sally Hoare will be long felt by many of usher poor afflicted ^Mother^ does indeed bend under the stroke
        The Norfolk friends are about establishing a select school for Boys (I believe at Needham) the only difficulty they find is in procuring a suitable Master, if thou have knowledge of any person equal to the important undertaking & at liberty to move it will be very acceptable information, but, I imagine you will not like to export any thing very clever        
        I cannot think it any deviation from my Prudence to confide in thine, but, thy old friend is such a character as I know not how to deliniate [sic], there appears something officious in the man that will not suffer him to be at peace with himself or others, I understand that he wishes to have his cause tried at the ensuing Yearly Meeting & I suppose with that ^view^ endeavours to draw his own meeting into some more decisive act, at present he is only recommended agreeable to the sence [sic] of the monthly meeting to discontinue his appearances as a Minister, untill [sic] they can [word obscured] fully approve his conduct, with this request save in one or two instances, he has complyd, but he talks and writes a great deal to bring others to think as he does, that he has been treated with cruel partiallity [sic], and he has I believe at several times since sent papers in to the meeting to that effect, which the several committees appointed to read them, reported as containing no new matter, therefore ^not^ necessary to be read in the meeting, I have now told all I know of him only that I sincerely wish him to be brought to a knowledge of himselfI am much obliged by thy recommendation of Books I have ordered Matho [?], but those who depend on Norwich Booksellers had need to be previously endued with patiencePray, may I ask which of the many English Grammars thou givest preference toI do also thank thee for those sweet unaffected lines of thy Margshas she seen any of Hayleys Poetry? I wish to know if you admire him as much as I do
My most affectionate & respectful salutations greet all thy good familyI suppose my friend Lydia has ere now added to thy stock of Grandchildren
                Believe me thy very affectionate
                & much Obliged Cousin
                        Hannah Pim
