Tar mills 8 mo 16 . 1806 -
Dear Uncle
We were informed of James White
& our cousin Lydia having laid their intentions
of marriage before your Mo. meeting
& sincerely wish they may be happy which
I have little doubt of, from the small acquantance
I have of Lydia I know that she
is calculated to make a man happy,
she is of a chearful disposition & possesses
an uncommon good understanding, I also
know James from the time we were
schoolfellows, & believe him to be a steady
prudent young man. - Thou hast
heard of the proposal I have made in Cork,
I have the pleasure to inform thee that I
have received the consent of her parents &
friends, so that it now rests with herself,
I returned from Cork last 4th day
after spending a week at Clue-hill

My mind is still exceedingly anxious
as to the event, not being at all
able to guess which way she is inclined - -
We still are in
want of a Chaise, dost thou know where
we could get a good second hand one?
if thou thought we could make out [deletion][/deletion]
that would answer in Dublin, & that it
would be convenient for thee to have
them, I would not matter stepping up
with thee,- besides I'll want to buy
a covered gig for myself. I shall
take it particularly kind [insertion]thy[/insertion] droping me
a line in reply as soon as convenient,
for my Gover[insertion]n[/insertion]ment, as if it be agreeable
to thee & that thou saw a likelihood
of our succeding, I should arrainge
matters so as to be with thee & also

to be back in time to pay a visit
to Cork, if [underline]I should receive no countermand[/underline]. -
Tho Haughton & his daughter
are now there. - [unclear]&[/unclear] I hope that thy
are now there. - I hope that thy
[underline]nice[/underline] family & all our relatives at
Ballitore are well, to whom thou
wilt please affectionately to present
my love & am very truly
Thy affec Nephew
Richd Grubb.
Please to say how George is?
