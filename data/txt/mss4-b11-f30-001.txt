Juliet Smith, writing to Thomas Wilkinson
on the event of Mary Leadbeater's
decease, says "I had a great esteem and
sincere regard for Mary Leadbeater, her
loss must be very great to her family!
For herself, the purity of her mind
and the benevolence of her actions, have
doubtless (through redeeming love) procured
her a blessed exchange. If you write
to her daughters pray assure them of
any condolence and kind regard."
August 1826
