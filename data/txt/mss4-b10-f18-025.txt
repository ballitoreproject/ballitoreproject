Ballyhack - Waterford River
June 28th 1858 -
My dear Mamma
I just write a line
lest you might be uneasy about
us, if you heard from Huldah
that we had left Dunmore,
which we did yesterday Eveng,
to try if we could make our
way towards Cork - but the wind
was so much against us,
that there was no use in trying,

to get on, as the sea was very
heavy, so we came back, & came
on here instead of going back
to Dunmore, as this was
more variety, all up this river
is very pretty, and Manliff
is just after being on shore,
& has brought us a most beautiful
salmon fresh out of
the net - the wind has continued
the [underline]wrong[/underline] way for us,
ever since we came here, so
I hope it may soon take a
fancy to change - we will
try, Can we make out a post
today to put this note in, so
I hope you may get it to-morrow,
if not, you must take the will
for the deed, and do not be
at all uneasy about us, as
we must take our time, & wait
for a wind, and I may not
always be in a place we can
get a post, perhaps only an
anchorage - with dear love
to you all, ever your much
attached MJB -
