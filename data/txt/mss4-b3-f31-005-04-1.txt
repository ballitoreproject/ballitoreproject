From the same to the same


Ballitore [blank] of 10th month 1788


Dear friend


++ I received thy precious lines which I highly value as having come from thy hand  Perhaps after our national meeting I may make some sort of a reply to them  In the mean time, the wish of my heart is that it may be consistent with Infinite Wisdom to replenish my beloved friend with health & strength both inwardly and outwardly, so that in and by ^& through^ thee the great Masters name may be magnified, the church edified, and thy peace confirmed by the seal of divine approbation, beyond all reasonings, doubts and fears ot eh creature.
Farewell        R. S.
