To one inhabiting the Parthenon,
named
Sarah Leadbeater
from an Irishman
Edinburgh 8 Mo. 12 - 1820. -
T. F. to S. L. -
An Irishman takes this opportunity
of addressing his fair country-woman,
& of [deletion]inf[/deletion] asking her whether she received
a communication from him dated about a
month since - if not, - please to enquire
of Edward Alexander whether he received
a note from [underline]Dorothy Costello[/underline] [deletion]res[/deletion] enclosing
a letter for Miss Sarah Leadbeater. -
As I have made thee one of my
privy-counsellors, I must inform thee
that I have entirely given up my intention
of visiting London, & therefore request
thee to inform all whom it may concern
that I intend spending the ensuing winter
in Edinburgh. -
Return thy sister Deborah my best
thanks for her annual epistle, which I
was sorry [deletion]to[/deletion] [insertion]not to have[/insertion] received until three months

after its date. -
How do thy mathematical & metaphysical
studies go on? - I hope thou continues to
like Dugald Stewart - I am going over
his works again, as I have [insertion]it[/insertion] in prospect to
write a Thesis in Insanity, & think I
may find some useful hints concerning morbid
Intellect, in his masterly Treatise on the
laws which regulate it in a sound state.-
Hast thou received the translations of the
Latin quotations, for my brother informed
me some time ago that he had sent them
to Edward Alexander for thee. - Thou wilt
be perhaps rather surprised to hear that Wilson
the poet, author of "The Life of Palms" - has
succeeded to the [deletion]chair[/deletion] [insertion]professorship[/insertion] formerly held by Dugald
Stewart, rendered vacant by the death of
the amiable & lamented Dr. Brown. - The great
[deletion]qualification[/deletion] recommendation which Wilson
possessed in the eyes of his supporters is his Toryism,
which alone proved sufficient to counterbalance
the strongest recommendations of the
moral character & scientific attainments, of
the rival candidate, [insertion]Sir Wm Hamilton[/insertion] - from such men as
the venerable Dr. Parr, & Dugald Stewart
& several other great characters. - But this
political servility will in the end, be the
ruin of the Scotch people - It is impossible
that science can flourish long in such dark
minds. - This base conduct must eventually
blight the fame of a University, which they
do not deserve to possess. -
An American ministering friend, named
Nathan Hunt, is expected here this evening. -
I am told he is very fond of public meetings. -
Jesse Kersey is also shortly expected over. . I
had lately a letter from Jacob Harvey, who
informed me that he had given a letter of introduction
to me, to a young Philadelphian
friend, named Samuel [unclear]Merton[/unclear], [insertion]a medical student[/insertion] who is going to
spend the year here. - Mrs. Cruickshank [unclear]informs[/unclear]
me that he is in London now, & will [unclear][/unclear]
here in the winter. - I hope he will lodge [unclear][/unclear]
this house, for I like to have a Quaker to
keep me company. - Farewell for the present.
