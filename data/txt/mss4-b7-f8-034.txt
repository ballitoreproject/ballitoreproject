Waterford 28th Secondmonth 1787
My dear Molly
I was not without hopes of a line from
thee ere now; although in strict justice, if the Rub
of Retaliation be put in force, I can have no claim
to such indulgence for a considerable time to come —
Haply thou wilt not be so rigorous as to persist
in debarring me of the pleasure of thy correspondence
I understand there is some chance of seeing Sally
in Waterford before she quit Munster I heard from
Sam Grubb the other day that she was well &
through him I heard of my Friends in Ballitore
Pat Rogers I suppose can inform thee of every
memorable occurrence that happened here if any
there be for my part I move in such a
narrow sphere that nothing particular comes
to
WRayner
Waterford: 28/2 mo: 1787

to my knowledge — We have a forsaken Shepherd
here John Penrose however I apprehend his disappointment
will not occasion a sudden or
violent exit as he seems to bear it with resignation
I doubt but the damsel would prefer a
Country Life to a City one — How do amorous affairs
prosper in your quarter — I heard flying reports long
since which I would not chuse to circulate — If
there be any truth they must be notorious & if thy
silence be not occasioned by thy being intimately
concerned perhaps thou may tell me something more
I saw a glimpse of my old acquaintance Leadbeater
he is a well-looking young man
Please present me affectionately to Uncle Aunt
& Cousin Abys family & when opportunity serves to Debby
& her Spouse
I am thine sincerely
William Rayner
