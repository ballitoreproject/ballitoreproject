My dear E - I recd thy two very welcome
letters & was sorry the last came too
late for me to see M R I was out
& when I came home found thy letter
but I thought any going then wd only
be an intrusion on Mary, I wish
thou had staid till she came
& I could have seen the little boys
under thy wing if I had known how
soon she would have been here I would
have endeavour'd to [insertion]have[/insertion] forced thee to stay
one week longer - Mag. walks now
& not without the consciousness of being

admired for her feats, no tooth has
appear'd yet - I am glad Hannah
has overcome the difficulties of nursing
the swine pox & that all go on well
I do not think M A P was much loss to them
say if you have heard when E & D propose
returning & buy some duck eggs for me
When convenient - I do not think
that any but the Princess' Charlotte's
death caused such a general lamentation
as Byron's he was [insertion] or seem'd to have [/insertion] the greatest been
man on the earth - We hear but
hope earnestly that it may be false.
that his memories were burnt
by T Morse to please his family
Didst thou speak to W Doyle yet?
I would like to know if she would come
as I would much prefer her to the
Dublin attendants appropos I send some
bobbin
