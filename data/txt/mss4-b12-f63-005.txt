My dr. Friend, I am really ashamed at my delaying so long to answer
thy last acceptable favour, & hardly think myself capable of
making sufficient apology, want of opportunity was the principle
cause & I had a hope of meeting thee in Moat, where I could verbally
assure thee of the continuance of my affection & warmth
of my friendship for my Dear Lydia, but was disappointed: thou
cannot imagine more regret, than I experienced, at being within
so few miles of you & not having an interview with you in my
power. I determined as soon as I returned to address thee in this
manner, but was afresh convinced of the rectitude of the phrase
That, [insertion]tho'[/insertion] Man proposes, the Almighty disposes of us as he pleases, jus[unclear]t[/unclear]
on my return I was seized with a voilent disorder in my head
thro[insertion]a[/insertion]t, & jaw at one side, which I had some apprehension wd.
have put a period to my life, & could not swallow any liquid
with great pain, nor receive the smallest particle of solid within
my teeth my jaw was so fast locked, & could hardly speak
intelligible, my sleep forsook me & I could say with Job
painful nights & wearisome days were appointed me. A Surgeon
was applyed to who seemed very sensible of the danger, & [unclear]restupes[/unclear]
[insertion]& poultices[/insertion] were used, which I believe under providence were of
service for the gathering broke inside & discharged a quantity of

of corrupt matter, which immediately relieved me from the pain, &
now I am recovering, tho' weakened by the loss of food & sleep added
to other discharges. It was a time of searching of heart to me, & I
think I beheld clearly the necessity there is for as in time of health to
walk in great humility & circumspection, so that we may have
confidence to apply for relief to the great Physician [insertion]of value[/insertion] in the [deletion]time[/deletion] [insertion]season[/insertion]
of distress, & indeed all this world can afford, is by no means
comparable to an inheritance in him, his blessings make[deletion]s[/deletion] truly
rich & is accompanied with no sorrowful sensations. May we
chase him for our portion & confide in his All powerful arm.
I trust we have not by disobe[deletion]y[/deletion]dience forfeited his [deletion]notice[/deletion] [insertion]protection[/insertion], & will
yet have to say by living experience "He is the [unclear][/unclear] (indeed)
of ten thousand." While I [deletion]write[/deletion] freely [insertion]write[/insertion] what occurs without premeditation
I recollect with freshness the origin[deletion]s[/deletion] of our [underline]friendship[/underline], that did
not begin with our acquaintance, we were long unacquainted with
each others hearts, till drawn I hope by an [deletion]invisible draft[/deletion] [insertion]supernatural hand[/insertion], &
our love to one another seemed strong, such a conne[deletion]x[/deletion]ction shall
I call it & I would wish [insertion]still[/insertion] to subsist, & my [unclear]strongest desire[/unclear] is
that neither heights nor depths, nor any thing whatsoever may be
able to separate us from this love, that [deletion][insertion]which[/insertion][/deletion] just inited our hearts
I hope my Dear friend will soon favour me with a letter, write by
post for I shall be uneasy to hear from thee; & shall not [deletion]think[/deletion]
[deletion][/deletion] take it well if thou leaves me in saspens
tho' it is only [unclear][/unclear] diserve, yet I hope from thee something more
