When C. Canius, a Roman
Kngiht a facetious & sensible
Man, & of some Learning went to
Syracuse not about Business but
to do nothing as he used to say, he
gave notice that he should be glad
to purchase a Country house near the
city where he might divert himself
sometimes with his Friends, without
the Importunity of visitors. The report
of this spreading over all the city,
a certain Banker at Syracuse, call'd
Pytheus told him he had indeed a country
house but not to sell that Canius
might make use of it as his own &
entreated him to dine with him at it
the next day. Canius promising he
around the Banker whose occupation
made him acceptable to all sorts of
people sent for some fishermen &
desired them to fish before his house
the day following, giving them some
other directions proven for his design.
Canius came at the time appointed
he found a magnificent entertainment
& the sea covered with Fishermens
Boats who one after another
brought Pitheus fish in abundance
At this sight Canius being very much
over prized what says he to Pytheus is
there such a quantity of fish & such
a number of fishing boats here every
day. every day answered Pytheus
this is the only place about Syracuse
where there are any fishes where water
is to be got if it were not for this place
people coud not subsist, hereupon
Canius enamoured with the house
presses Pytheus to sell it to him. Pytheus
seems very unwilling is mightily
courted but consents at last Canius being
a rich man & having a strong fancy
for the house gives Pytheus whatever
he asks for it together with the furniture.
The contract is signd & the affair ended - Canius
entreats his friends to come to see him the
day following at his new habitation He repairs
thither himself very early in the morning
but sees neither fishing men nor fishing
boats. He asks a neighbor whether the f[unclear][/unclear]
fishingmen were making a holiday s[unclear][/unclear]
[unclear]none of them there[/unclear] Not that I [unclear]k[/unclear]

I wrote to my father for the books
that I wrote for before.
of replys the Neighbour for there never
is any fishing at this place & I was yesterday
surprized to see so many fishing
boats upon this Canius began to fall
into a great rage but what coud he do
the laws against deceit & treachery were
not yet established
