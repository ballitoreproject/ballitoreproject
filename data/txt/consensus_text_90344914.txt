21st.. Margaret and I went to meeting
after which as the day continued
fine we went to Harolds Cross
bridge where William Raynor is
with his daughter whom Margt
wanted to see - we returned by
the canal as far as Leeson st
bridge and home by Merrion
sqr so had a fine long walk.
I called up at John's as Margt
wished me to ask Elizabeth to
spend fifth day evening with
us to which she consented. The
whole of after dinner I was
writing letters - Charlie rode in
this morning from Fassaroe
Just in time for tea came
Uncle Francis he will I think
