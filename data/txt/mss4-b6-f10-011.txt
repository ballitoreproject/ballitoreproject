Ballitore: 28/11 mo: 1807
My dear friend
I received thy very kind & interesting letter with grateful feelings
for the favour, & for thy exertions in my business, which has susceeded pretty
well & if thy ability had been proportioned to thy inclination I am certain I
need not have stopped the printing of 1500 when two sheets were done, & attend
the plan to 1000. I spent 6 weary weeks in Dublin, tho' among very kind friends,
The most tedious I ever remember to have passed, partly owing to the extreme wetness
of the weather, & to the constant perplexity & fatigue of body & mind which
this foolish undertaking occasioned. I left all going on much to my mind, & hear
good accounts. I suppose in about two months the book will come out. I am
about sending my address to Rushton on the recovery of his sight to be inserted
in the work, & I wanted to mention in a note the manner of his losing, as well
in the recovery of his sight. Was it not by attending sick Negroes? I have the account
but cannot find it. I was so rejoiced at hearing of this extraordinary man's
restoration to light, that, like Thos. Ellwood, I celebrated it in verse, & just as it was
finished Wm Dudley came & I had but just time to copy it fair to send by him.
We were alarmed about Wm lest he should have been on board one of those ships
whose wrecks we heard of with much concern, but trust he was favoured to get
over safe: I was a good deal with Ben & June in Dublin. Dear Ben! I never
loved him better! He committed to my care some books for thee, with an apology
about them, which I really have mostly forgot. I send them by Richd. Davis
also the Carlow poetry, which I am obliged to thee in the perusal of. That it
acknowledges the merit of our friend Maharg I think is its only praise. I think
no kind of poetry requires uncommon talents so much as Satire - fine should be the
edge of the instrument which is used by the hand which means to heal, but
burglars with their blunt [underline]gapped[/underline] knives, wound, & irritate & enflame without
doing any good. The Bees, tho' they sting, produce honey, but wo to those who

rouse the worthless Wasps! I gave Nancy's commission of filial kindness to
Mary Doyle. I shall have pleasure in accomodating James with such
books that I have. I believe he is at present engaged with Don Quixotte. I hope you
will not blame him for admiring that excellent romance. James is a very fine boy.
I parted my dear Agnes, her Mother & her [underline]Lover[/underline], in Dublin, & did not hear from
them till the day of my return, when John Christy received a letter from Wm
[unclear]Ramaze[/unclear], with the affecting account of John's father's illness, nigh unto death
They had found him ill, & forebore writing till he was better, but he grew so ill
that it was thought necessary to apprize his Son. The distress of poor John was
great indeed, & he felt the anguish of such a wide separ[insertion]a[/insertion]tion at such a time very
acutely. However he has since been relieved by hearing of his father's getting better.
I suppose it was an inflammation on his lungs. Agnes gave herself up entirely
to attend her parent, sleeping scarce 3 hours in the 24, & scarce taking her necessary
food. I wish she may not have suffered in her health. Her mother has been ill since,
& after three years ahence from her home, [insertion]my friend on[/insertion] her return found a different scene from
what was expected. Her wedding day was fixed when her father's state prevented.
I need now make no secret of the gallant Capts faithful attachment to her from
her childish years, which time, absence & different scenes could never shake, even
when without hope - to her he attributes his success & respectability in life - he
cultivated his talents, & preserved his virtues to become worthy of the prize; He
had his principles formed by an excellent mother & elder sister, when he lost them
he found this [unclear]treasure[/unclear], & when I say he deserves to obtain it I say a great deal for him
Her delicacy shrunk from the idea of being spoken of in this way, the young man's
situation rendering it so uncertain when a union would take place, therefore very few
knew of it, her brother & I were all whom she confided it to here, & it was not till after
we were long & intimately acquainted that she trusted me with this secret, which
but one in Scotland knew beside her own family, & one in England till latterly
Lord St. Vincent was taken into the baby house. Their story is as uncommon, & as
interesting as most one meets with in fiction, & the more one knows of it the
higher their characters rise in esteem. Our visit to Carlow was hastened, & our return
home was hastened by the prospect of WR's arrival, for the change of
Ministery, just after he had received a Capts. commission, prevented his being appointed

appointed to a ship & gave him leisure to devote to his Beloved & her family
I need not tell thee I wait with some anxiety to hear that this event has taken
place, & am ready to rejoice with trembling, lest any other obstruction should come in
the way of a union, which has been so long impeded, & which promises almost too much
happiness for human nature. I intend enclosing my dear Mothers letter to the
Historian & his reply. Deborah, who is at present busy spinning, sends her love, &
bids me tell thee she is at times engaged adding to her quilt with thy present. M:
Doyle sends her's & will be much obliged by thy letting her have, if convenient to thee,
a [unclear]cool[/unclear] of butter, as much under as can, but not to exceed 11 d per lb. If she can get
it she wishes to have it sent by the first car coming, or in one of our chaises.
We long & hope to hear all good things of thy dear Mary, present us cordially
to her. Please give my dear love to Sister Chandlee, I owe her for a long & kind
letter, also to Sister Higginson, D Wilsons family & Abby Pim. We had a terrible
snow storm here. Nancy & Fanny Bewley were greatly distressed to get along
from Betsy Barrington, & my WL's life was in immenent danger
To Edward Rushton on the recovery of his sight.
Welcome to light restored, sweet Bard -
To faith & patience deeply try'd
To fortitude, the rich reward
Unerring Heaven has now supply'd.
Thy smile fair Nature's smile shall meet,
While, glancing round, thy raptur'd gaze
Her well-remember'd charms shall greet
The theme so frequent of thy lays.
And thou shalt see the blushing dawn
Bright o'er the swelling hills arise;
And thou shalt see the dewy lawn,
When evening paints the western skies.
And thou shalt see thy Merseys tide
Thro' fertile vallies gently stray;
And thou shalt see the Ocean wide
The wealth of other realms convey.
Thou seest, while joy thrills thro' thy veins,
Thy gratulating friends draw nigh
And what the modest tongue restrains
Shall glisten in the speaking eye.
And thou shalt dwell upon her face,
Whose love has cheer'd thy years of pain
Thy children's opening beauties trace -
And tears shall dim thine eyes again
It was at Pity's sacred shrine
The costly sacrafice was made,
Thy precious sight, the spark divine,
Quench'd, while thou lent the wretched aid
But now the film is drawn aside,
Thy hearts fond prayer is granted thee
Then bless the light so long deny'd,
For thou beholds the Negro free!

coming home from the Inn that night. I suppose several were lost. Farewell
my dear kind friend
thy obliged & affte.
