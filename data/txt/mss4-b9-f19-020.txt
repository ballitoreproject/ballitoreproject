Ballitore 29th 10th mo 1815
Here I am with pen [deletion][/deletion] ink & paper
but so sterile is my imagination that
I almost thought it better not to write
but perhaps I may gather up some news
for thee, what thou likes best when from
home [deletion]at least[/deletion] I have heard thee express
this, once to Charles Farmer & me
that gentleman I scarcely ever see &
more scarcely ever speak to, Maurice
is here at present very sorry at not being
able to see thee in Waterford but hoping
for the honor in a few days he intends
leaving this tomorrow he visits us
twice every day generally from 11 AM to 2
& then from 6 to 10 in the evening
he is a great admirer of the Creightons
particularly Bessie & she of him.
he has quite out shone Charles

& says he [insertion]IE Charles[/insertion] cant do better than be a
Miller at Inchaquire. I suppose thou
hast ere this heard [deletion]of[/deletion] all the news
of Ballitore, however for fear thou
miss hearing of our excursions to [unclear]Henry[/unclear]
[unclear]Tower[/unclear] I may tell we spent a pleasant
day there & on our return finish'd
my aunt Lydia car commonly call'd
the tub it is now as next summer
to be appropriated to garden seats
all the company escaped very well
& no one in the least injured except
George whose foot was bruised by
the wheel of the car a chaise was
sent to take up the scatter'd remnant
of our flock which was as well fill'd
as Mrs Gilpins having in & about it
six precious souls [deletion]another one[/deletion]
Mary Shackleton Thomas Harris
& thy humble servant had a fine wet

ride all the way home I dont think
Thomas Harris much alter'd in appearance
since he left school only that he
is now a spruce young man & [deletion]the[/deletion] he
was then an innocent artless little boy,
art thou acquainted with him
Harriet Le fanu left us on 4th day
last having spent 3 weeks here & she
writes since her return home [unclear]Thom[/unclear]
intends to spend a week here before
christmas Rachel Wright left
us, in tears, yesterday morning she
very tenderhearted Sam has quite
recover'd his health, my mother did
not visit the Grattans since their
sore affliction being afraid of the
fever tho I believe there is no danger
now. What a pity to have the Cathedral
burnt! What became of the old woman?
I am become a great horse woman of

late & our grey colt is a most easy elegant
Lady's horse
Farewell for the
present thy LS
I suppose thou wilt
find the Williams's in the Cottage
when thou comes home & when
will that be? answer me in thy next
if thou can
SL
Elizabeth Leadbeater
Waterford
I suppose my mother told thee
of the visit [deletion]of the[/deletion] Edgeworths
paid us
excuse this stupid epistle but none
from thee has inspired me to write a
better one
