On Blakeney Watson drowned on
the day on which Moses Shaw & Susanna
Jessop were married.
Rise jocund morn lead on the day
When fears & doubts remove
And Susan yields her plighted hand
To Crown her Moses love.
With balmy breath, ye western gales
O'er yonder flowerets play
This garden fair expects a train
Brilliant & sweet as they.
Ye feather'd songsters from the Bower
Let your shrill notes resound
For there shall sit the happy pair
By love & Virtue crown'd
T'was

Twas thus the Muse in joyous mood
Attund the artless lay -
But tears [deletion]obscurd[/deletion] [insertion]bedimm'd[/insertion] the loit'ring morn
And clouds obscur'd the day.
Say what delays the bridal train
Why move they on so slow
Why wear the brows of those who meet
The sullen gloom of wo.
Why stays blithe Watson? - when [underline]he[/underline] comes
The scene will soon be gay -
O grief to tell! - poor Watson lies
Grim Death's untimely prey. -
This fatal morn beheld him [underline]rise[/underline]
His careless limbs to lave -
This fatal morn beheld him [underline]fall[/underline]
And perish in the [underline]wave[/underline].
Glide
Glide on, glide on, O guilty Suir
And hide thee in the Sea
Is not that pale that lifeless corpse
A mute reproach to thee
While down thy banks all wildly pour
His friends a frantick train
"Oh let us fan the spark of life
If any spark remain".
But vain your cares - that spark is fled
The Pulse no more shall beat
And life will ne'er again return
To fill her vacant seat
No art can bid the fire of youth
Light up these eyes once more
No art can to the faded cheek
The bloom of health restore.
No wonder then, ye bridal train
Ye mov'd so sadly-slow -
No wonder that your brows should wear
The sullen gloom of wo.
The

The pensive youths with pious care
Hang o'er their breathless friend
The maids in mournful groupes are met
Their pitying tears to blend.
But do not grieve ye wedded pair
That your attendants stray
And the dire shade of Death o'ercasts
Glad Hymens sprightly ray
Tho' mirth forsakes your joyless walks
yet dont at this repine
For see the sweetly glistening eyes
Of love & pity shine.
Tho Melancholy's gloom o'erspreads
The prospect once so fair
Reflection loves the sober shade
And seeks for wisdom there.
While
While he who pale & silent lies
Sad subject of my song
Shalt thus an awful lesson preach
Loud as an Angels tongue.
"Be wise & learn that earthly bliss
"Is ne'er without alloy
"And in the midst of life is Death
"To dash the cup of joy."
MS.

To Edmund Burke, with a pair of Gloves
supposed to be spoken by the Glove.
Despise me not, but grant my claim,
I from thy own Hibernia came:
Let me that generous hand infold,
And guard it from the wintry cold;
O could I it's deserts command,
An Empire's runs should fill that hand,
for 'twas for noblest deeds designd,
To shield & polish humankind;
Whose toils, which suffering nations share,
It stoops as great to lesser care;
The sick, the poor, that hand befriends,
And healing balms humanely blends,
now let thy zeal its wish give o'er
A sceptre could not grace it more!

On Blakeney Watson
