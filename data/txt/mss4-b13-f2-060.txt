209
& night preceding, long to be remembered by me; I felt weak in
body & mind when I sat down in meeting, but after a while I
thought I felt a little right strength, in which I ventur'd, S:T
livingly engaged in testimony, & Jane Pearson in prayer: went
to afternoon meeting at 3 O'clock, a few others invited, & S:T
concerned for their good: I observed ill behaviour in some young
women, & took courage to remark it to them, telling them, that
tho' I supposed they wished to be taken for folk in high life,
& of good education, yet I thought this expression might be
applied to them, "All is not Gold that glistens." We went home
with J:Pearson to tea, after which sat with her & family, it
was a time of favour, & my heart was engaged to wish Jane's
best attention turned towards my precious brother Abraham,
&, when rightly put into her heart, to pray for his preservation.
