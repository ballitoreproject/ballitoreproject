Tottenham 4 mo 21st 1783
Dear Cousin
Thy very acceptable Letter of [unclear][deletion]the[/deletion][/unclear] must I publish
my shame! - the 7th 9 mo 1778, is still amongst divers others unanswered
but not the oldest; nor yet the least valued, therefore it shall not
remain the last; - to account satisfactorily for my long delay
might be difficult, though perhaps not impossible with the allowances
thou would'st make - pure Love covering a multitude of
faults - suffice it then to say, that when I look at the date
I regret my loss, for I do highly value thy Correspondence, & retain
for thee [deletion][/deletion] & for [deletion][/deletion] every branch of your much loved Family the
same unremitting affectionate regard I ever have been done from the
first of our acquaintance & permit me the pleasure of adding, our
subsequent very happy alliance; my Dearest [underline]in unison[/underline] is at this
juncture employed in addressing her beloved faithful Friend &
relative, thy Sister Chandlee, which must excuse me to her; she
has I believe a like design upon thy worthy Father, to whom also I
hold myself indebted, though if I remember right I had the last word
with him in the epistolary way; but she hath so long & successfully
been in the habit of discharging my debts of this part for me, with
Interest, to my satisfaction & [insertion]to[/insertion] that of my Friends, that I find strong
inclination to let her occupy her Talent freely, acknowledging her
superiority in this as well as in Vocality in the art of speaking -
this [deletion]letter[/deletion] will probably be handed by a young Man, who, though a
Native of Dublin, is much a stranger there Having left it a Child; he
is going over to pay his Mother a visit, & in consequence of an intimacy
that hath some time subsisted between my Son & him, he hath requested
of me Letters introductory to some of my acquaintance; should
this induce thee or Cousins to take notice of him, [deletion]s[/deletion]he will doubtless
reap advantage from it, & I hope it will be attended with no inconvenience
to thee or them, trusting that his good understanding will
be a bar to encroachment or any improper use of the Favour, for
such he will esteem it or I am mistaken, however, I am sure he ought.
he hath a manliness & stability unusual at his years, but a bluntness
withal that is rather against him with Strangers; on the whole I believe
he is an honest well [unclear]minded[/unclear] lad, & hath hitherto conducted well, deserving
en-

encouragement; his Parents, I understand, being low in Circumstances
& he appearing possessed of uncommon talents whilst a mere Child,
attracted the notice of the late Thomas Cummin, who took him
under his patronage & brought him over with intent to provide
for him, but dying soon after, the lad was put to Gildersome
School & is now apprentice with Thomas Wright the King's
Watchmaker - so much at present with respect to James Roper -
further this [unclear]Appicmant[/unclear] saith not - But proceed to inform thee
that there is [insertion]now[/insertion] in London a young Scotch Physician, blind from the
age of 15 Months who hath acquired great Knowledge in Philosophy
Mathematics &c, - & is in daily communicating Portions of it to numerous
Audiences much to satisfaction if not to [insertion]the[/insertion] edification of most that
attend, but we may suppose some even in London see & hear &
understand not; The Doctor however delivers his [underline]Lectures[/underline] in a very
pleasing intelligent manner, & is agreeable in person as well as
behaviour, notwithstanding the defect in his eyes, which he covers
by spectacles of the common construction, with Glasses of a deep
green, we descend to the minutia of great Character, I wish thou
wast here to see for thyself, we could easily introduce thee to his
Company & aequaintance, being a Friend & Visitor of our Relations
in Lombard Street, Doctor & Mary Knowles; he hath been once at
our Villa already & favours us with another Visit this week if
nothing hinder; We have but just parted with our beloved Friend
& Country Women, Christn. Hirsthen & Hannah Wigham, who [deletion][/deletion] [insertion]being[/insertion] engaged
in a Visit to Families in Gracechurch Street & The Peel Meetings,
come down now and then, by way [insertion]of[/insertion] a little Relax, or rest from their close
Exercise, we expect them again shortly. John Hustler also is in
Town on Business, & comes down with them; thus are we in the
way of many Gratifications amidst the Cares & Concerns that [insertion]necessarily[/insertion] attend
a Situation like ours, may we be found walking worthy of all our
Benefits, or rather sensible of our unworthiness, thus shall we
profit under every dispe[insertion]n[/insertion]sation. We once had it in contemplation
to remove to London, in consequence of an alteration in the Partnership,
which took place above a Year ago, but have concluded to stay a while longer
at Tottenham, where we still hope for the pleasure of thy Company, &
as the Yearly meeting is near I take the liberty of again soliciting the favour

favour, expectations thy [unclear]Fath....[/unclear] sincerely wish thy Mother also
may find a Liberty at least [unclear].....me[/unclear]; it is needless to repeat
that we should rejoice to see you; do second nor request,
believing that everything shall be considered as agreeable as
in our power to them & to thee; if you were to come we
should have more of My Worthy Father's Company, he usually
allowing us we think but a small share -
My Dearest, & Sister Deborah Birkbeck, who is now with
us, desire to unite with me in very Dear Love to thy
Parents Brothers Sisters Self & Aunt Fuller, your other
Connections & friends as it may Suit thee to remember
us to them - I am thy trusty, affectionate Friend
P. S.
I enclose Head of Dr. Noyer's Lectures,
thy father would like the Man I am
persuaded
& Relative
