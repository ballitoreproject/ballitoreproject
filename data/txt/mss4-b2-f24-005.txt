Clonmel 22nd of 9th month 1779

My dear Father,

	I received from my sister Debby a melancholy letter last first day concerning my dear sister Mollys being attacked again with the fever, which they hoped had left her; this as thou ^may^ believe has occasioned me much distress; anxiously have I looked for, & expected a letter since, either to ease my fears, or to let me know the worst; (to relieve me from my state of suspense;) but have been disappointed, now the fourth day since I heard of her, I wrote to my sister Debby by first day nights post: poor Molly Roberts when morning comes is here anxious also about our dear sister, but I have no information to give her; I am also very thoughtful after my Mother, as sister writes me, her nerves have been affected; thou may think my Dear Father how uneasy I must be, my imagination at work suggesting the most gloomy things, again I think I will hope for the best & again the most distressing ideas croud [sic] upon my mind, the post did not come in yesterday, but the day preceding & this morning I might have got letters, Joseph [?] Pim wrote my Husband ^a letter^ about business, which he received this morning, & I have flattered myself with thinking that if dear Molly was removed he would mention it, & he says nothing at all about it. I hope my dear Father thou will be kind enough to advise me how she is until she is restored to health, if it so please Providence, which that it may I sincerely wish, on thine & my Mothers account (as well as my own, who would lament much the loss of such a sister,) & our dear Sallys; but I hope for good news, & shall endeavour to suppress my fears until I hear from you.
	Our neighbours [sic] family (Tom Chaylors) have been much frighted with an accident one of their borders met with, occasioned by a little Cannon which they were firing off, (tho contrary to their Masters commands,) a boy it seems put a stone secretly ^into^ it, another let it off, & a boy standing in the way had his knee shockingly tore & mangled with it, they say Cousin Betty fainted; but I understand the boy is recovering, & that it is not quite as bad as they at first expected. also [sic] another of their boys [sic] (son to Soloman [sic] Watson) is ill in a fever I believe it is.
	Our family thro mercy well, also our neighbours generally so I think.
	My dear love ^& Husbands^ is to you all, from thy
       dutiful & affectionate daughter
	Margaret Grubb
