30 Aungier street 3rd. Month 19th 1818.
My dear friend
Although I received no letter from
thee since I wrote to thee last, yet I still owe thee a letter
& since thy turn is now come, I settle the account.
We are rejoiced at the hope of Mary Chandlee’s returning
to us in a few days. I have felt very lonesome since
she went. - I am glad to hear that your adult school
increases in numbers, notwithstanding the endeavours of
the popish faction against education.
We (the Quaternion) are highly honoured by thy
poem which was duly received by the “leader of the law.”
It bears the stamp of being written by one who was
always accustomed to dwell on the bright side of men
& things.- I had a letter from my father a few days
ago, giving me leave to visit the North as soon as I
have leisure & inclination. I think it probable I shall
not go until next 8th Month.
The Quaternion cannot yet be said [deletion][/deletion] strictly to
be “formed against”) as we have not yet had the pleasure of

Joseph Layle’s company at any of our weekly meetings. In
a week or two we expect him to be sufficiently recovered &
the weather sufficiently favourable to allow him to do so. Joseph
Humphrey, Edward Alexander & I drank tea with
him last night. —We had the pleasures of William [unclear][/unclear]
company here lately, who accompanied his wife & Priscilla
Gurney on a religious visit to the country. He sailed last
night, & the other two are taking their rounds among
the Linster Monthly meeting. — I hope Deborah continues
to improve in health, & [deletion]to take care that it[/deletion]
taken care to preserve it as she acquires at.
Which of you may we expect to see from the “[unclear][/unclear]”
at the approaching yearly meeting. Thy writes Sally
of course, & who is to be her escort? Perhaps Betsy
will accompany her aunt Grubb here. I have not
heard lately how Lydia gets on with her Latin, has she
Atticen’s life almost completed? Hoping that I
shall soon hear from thee, & with affectionate remembrance
to all my Ballitore friends,
I remain thine, sincerely
Thomas Fisher.
