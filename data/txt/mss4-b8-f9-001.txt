Dublin 6 mo 9th 1826.
My dear Elizabeth
Wilt thou excuse [deletion]f[/deletion] me for
not replying sooner to thy note?
I would have done so before
only I was much engaged
with the wedding parties, and
having put off so long, thought
I might as well wait for Henry
& Ellen's return, who intend
leaving this tomorrow.
I must now tell thee with
regret, that neither my mother
or I, think I could accept
of thy very kind invitation

this summer, as in case
I should have any spare time
after the meeting, my cousins
The Hooeve's, would expect me
to spend it with them I so
seldom go to Edenderry.
At the same time, I feel
very much indebted to thee,
for this, as well as thy attention
to me when in Ballitore, a
[underline]place[/underline] I shall always think
of with pleasure, and hope
before long to visit again.
I trust thy mother's health
continues to improve, I
understand she gets out
almost every day, my
mother joins me in [unclear][/unclear]
love to you both [unclear][/unclear]
remember me also to
Deborah, and believe
Thy affecate.
E. Malone
