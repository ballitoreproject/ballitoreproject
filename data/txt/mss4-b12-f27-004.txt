crossed saying that Uncle Arthur
wished her not to come till
next week that he might
have the pleasure of seeing
her once in Killarkin I
dont know how it will
be now.
We will miss you on Sunday
very much, it wont be Sunday
without you, as for the "once
a week" dinners at Dalkey
Lodge, I dont know what we
will do -
On reading over Aunt Martha's
letters before burning them I
find what I told you about
Strongford Lough was quite
correct, Uncle Arthur told
Uncle Fred a different story
and Fanny read Aunt Matty's
letter wrong -
I hear it whispered in a
round about way that it

is likely Uncle Richard and
Aunt Elizabeth will go to
Switzerland with Norman
and Florence, I am not
telling you this as a fact
for I was not told, did
they mention it to you? -
If it is true we will not
see them for some time as
they have promised to go to
Hereford on their way home
This place [insertion]is[/insertion] very lonely when
you are all away - nobody
to go see & nobody to come
see us - The yacht too is
away, the harbour seems quite
lonely & Uncle Manliff is
like a fish out of water
we are going down to day
to see whether she has made
her appearance It is well they
did not wait for her - -
Lizzie Renkesvitz enjoyed
her wedding trip very much
she says her "father & mother
in law are a quaint old couple
& that Theodore's sister is a
nice young woman" -
I hope to hear from you on
or before Tuesday telling what
you have been doing, where
you are going next and
what address I am to put
on my letters -
I believe Willie Barrington
is not come back yet -
watch for him -
To day is changing fast heavy
clouds like Thunder floating about
I hope you have it fine crossing
to France
Grdmama is as well as usual
did you pay Oldham for
the last bottle, I had to pay
the carriage out - I have
no news to tell at all but

I suppose you would rather
get this much on Sunday
than nothing as the five
days will then appear a
fortnight without hearing any
thing about us -
My love to Dr Henry Catherine
and yourself. hoping you
will have a pleasant trip
come back safe and remember
me in the [unclear]Stamp[/unclear] love
ever your affectionate niece
[underline]Emily Malone[/underline]
Gd mama sends her love -
