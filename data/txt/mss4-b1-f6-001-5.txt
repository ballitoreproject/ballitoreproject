My Dear Master
On board the Foudrayant in Hamoze
near Plymouth - Octr 31st
Thinking [insertion]that[/insertion] an account of my self since I left Ireland, my present
situation & circumstances &c wou'd not be disagreeagoable to my dear
master & his family I take the Liberty of giving the following -
You are I believe already acquainted that urg'd by necessity & impell'd by no

to preferment & honour. accordingly, at last I obtain'd a recommendation
from Capt: Schomberg to Capt Jervis of the Foudroyant & 15 £ from Capt.
[unclear][/unclear] to fit me out. after a short time spent at the Rendezvouz in
Dublin, I embark'd on board the [unclear]Belican[/unclear] Tender, & after a tedious passage
at last arrived at Plymouth on the 21 August -76. I was the same
day carried on board the Foudroyant & was courteously receivd by
the 1st Lieut: (who was then commanding Officers, the Capt: being

The second day we came to fial. I had liberty with several more
Midshipmen, Surgeons Mates &c - to go on shore & see the place with
orders to be at the beech by six Oclock when there would be a boat
ready to bring us off, after spending an agreeable Day we came down
to the beech as we were order'd & there found the boat, but unfortunately
before 1/4 of an hour after, it began to blow a perfect Storm & there
being no possibility of getting off we were forc'd to stay, we went to
the Consuls & he receiv'd us nobly & provided lo[insertion]d[/insertion]gings for the boats crew
& beds for us (in all amounting to 14) in his own house.
