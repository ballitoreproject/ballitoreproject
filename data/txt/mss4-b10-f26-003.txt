My dearest Aunt.
Ten years to day since
we left Carlsruhe for Offenburg
stopping at Baden Baden to
wait for Uncle who remained behind
in the hopes of getting a letter
that he did not get from Dr Henry
We were glad to get both
your letters from Paris & felt
sorry when we came to the
end of the second not to know
where I am to direct this, which
I now write in order to have ready
to post as soon as we get your
next. I find my letters take
longer to go to you than yours
take to come here, how is that? -
I wrote "all's well" on Kaye Manlys
letter as we continued so &
there was nothing new to tell I
did not write since. I hope
you get Margt. Beale's letter
I felt quite sorry when I went
to Dalkey on Tuesday to find that
she must go & Mary to come in
her place. I told her I would feel
like a fish out of water, she says
that I will like Mary (her sister)
every bit as well as I like her
& she wants me to go over there
that she may introduce me
she speaks of leaving on Monday.
I shall report all to you -
Tell Uncle if he wanted
me to console myself in "Postage
Stamps" for the loss of "[unclear]Iron Anne[/unclear]"
he might have sent me a 25 c.
& 15 c to make up for the 40 c
at which I am tired looking. 2 letters
I had from you & I might have
been able to give one [insertion]of each[/insertion] to M & H
She has given me so many I
am longing to give her something
new.
Tell me where I will find your book
Joh. tells the names of all the wild
plants & the classes to wh. they belong

I could not find it in either of
the book cases in the parlour
at Dalkley (I mean the upper halves)
dont you remember it, it has a
green cover -
Mama intends leaving Killarkin
tomorrow "en route" for Glendruid
v√Æa Leopardstown where we are
to go for her, as Uncle Manliff's
wild pony gave the new mare
a Kick which prevents our going
into Dublin [deletion][/deletion]
Papa surprised us by popping in
at Dinner time to day fresh from
Dunlavin, Uncle M took both
him & Aunt Matty for a lovely
 sail in the "Norma" as it was
a glorious evening, the first sail
since the Norma returned from
Campbelstown wh. she left shortly
after Uncle Arthur, on Tuesday [superscript]x[/superscript]
& did not arrive in Kingstown
till [insertion]the 2nd instant[/insertion] 7-30 P M the Saturday following
the 6th instant -
