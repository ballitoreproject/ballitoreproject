Warrington, 4th of 2d mo. 1757.
Dear Friend
Ellen Evans,
That affectionate regard which Truth itself
raised mutually in our hearts is by no means impaired; often, very
often since I left your land has it been strongly revived, & more copiously
so upon receiving th[deletion]y[/deletion][insertion]e[/insertion] sorrowful tidings of the removal of thy dear
husband, a Circumstance in which the affliction is like the loss, very
extensive: Thou mourns the loss of a tender husband, his Children that of
an affectionate father, the Church laments a pillar removed from the
place it filled at a time when they are greatly wanted: a sorrow allowable;
for the perfect example of every virtue; even Jesus wept for Lazarus -
This nature demands when it's connections are broke, & the endeare[deletion]d[/deletion][insertion]ing[/insertion] social
ties dissolved. But thou well knows & I hope it now stands thee
in stead that we are pilgrims & strangers as our fathers were, & each
journeying on, thro' this region of distress towards that City which
hath foundations. . Why should we grieve too much if a Companion
with whom we have traversed many dubious anxious steps have
[deletion]their[/deletion] [insertion]his[/insertion] entrance into the holy city a few moments before us, & enjoy consummate
felicity, while we stand at the door, & wait also for the same
fruition, of which as times we receive the earnest.
Upon all the Glory of the Earth & all its enjoyments, upon every visible
thing, one inscription is written, as the immutable determination
of him whose name is the most high, "They shall perish," throughout
all nature & natural connections however ende[insertion]a[/insertion]ring it has been &
must be verified. Equally fixed is the subsequent Truth, the Joy & song
of many generations "But thou remains": on this everlasting husband,
fa=

Father, Friend & Succour may thou & thine now lean, & know
this dispensation sanctified & blessed to all yr. help, in renewing
diligent care to live & move, that when the great shepherd
shall appear & all his faithful servants with him, your portion
may be among them for ever. And now methinks I cannot avoid
addressing myself to you the descendants of my honoured (because
honourable) friend: I am convinced the same gracious hand, which was
his comfort has been near to some of you for the like glorious purpose,
even to establish before him forever. But I am jealous the want of
religious depth & simplicity God-wards hath been the cause of halting,
& rather a choice to embrace the present world, & have a name
of eminence in it, than to have a new name, the Name of God, & the
City of God. Thus will the heavenly tenders of immortal Treasure
be disregarded & the vain shadows of things be preferred to true
 Riches, none ever sought with too great diligence, or if they
sold it, got it's worth in exchange: a heart honestly concerned for
your help cannot contain or dictate flattery. I love you nearly;
therefore thus I write. I am also persuaded there is a seed &
heritage that mourns in secret because of it's leanness, & honestly
seeks relief whence it has ever sprung; may stability & patience be
the girdle of their loins, & in the Lords time this poor, suppliant,
distressed seed will delight itself in fatness. One General hint
from my own experience & the parity of our state wou'd I suggest to
you, young people; let all your conduct demonstrate, you remember
the worthy deceased with due affection, & tho' he be with respect to
the body, dead; yet let him speak: I have found it my duty & great
ad=

advantage to place in my view my worthy father, & in cases of importance
or dubious cases consult what wou'd have pleased him, who
was ripe in experience & judgment. I believe this rever[deletion]a[/deletion][insertion]e[/insertion]nce to the
memory of a worthy parent is an oblation of sweet in[deletion]s[/deletion][insertion]c[/insertion]en[deletion]c[/deletion][insertion]s[/insertion]e before the
everlasting Father. Farewell dear Ellen, may Israel's Rock be
thy safe abode, & keep fresh in spirit, green & fruitful in old-age,
& unite thee to him & the many generations of the Just,
who are stepped within the pearl-gates. Farewell, ye descendants
of the great & good, imitate [unclear]their example[/unclear]; as they have followed
Christ, follow ye them; be wise, for it is true happiness, in wisdom
ye will fear to offend, & this fear is an excellent defence.
I am with mine & wife's, & Samuel Emlen's dear love, all your
affectionate friend
Samuel Fothergill.

Saml. Fothergill
to Ellen Evans.
