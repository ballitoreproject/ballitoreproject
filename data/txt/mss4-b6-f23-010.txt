Thou man of virtue hast no cause for dread
Should this sick couch become thy dying bed
Thy stainless life with deeds of mercy fraught
Enforcing what thy pious precept taught
Bids even thy humble heart aspire to see
With hope & joy the crown prepared for thee
And yet it seems as tho' thy labring breast
Is with a secret sense of grief opprest
Can friendship aid thee Will thou not impart
To frdship's car the sorrows of thy heart
It was not Guilt which struggled there within
A [deletion]soul[/deletion] [insertion]mind[/insertion] delivered from the snares of sin
Yet of the past across that ransom'd soul
A dreadful recollection sadly stole
And ere the latest pangs of death began
Thus spoke the venerable dying man
Long has it been my wish the truths to prove
To fellow mortals of redeeming love
Those awful truths, deputed to declare,
Faithful I laboured with a Pastor's care
To our assemblies oft a maiden came
devout her manner graceful was her frame
yet veil'd so closely that the curious eye
could not one feature of the unknown descry
But that expression from her face deny'd
[deletion][/deletion] [insertion]methought[/insertion] her mien her air her gait supply'd
Heaven seem'd o'er evry gesture to preside
The stranger came & she return'd alone
But whence she came & where returned unknown
Time glided by one evening to my home
I saw I noted well two strangers come
men, who of gentle birth appeared but stern
And [insertion]on their aspects[/insertion] grief [deletion]upon their brows[/deletion] I could discern
With earnest speech & with an anxious air
They prayed me that with them I would repair
A Lady that the doctrines which I taught
Had heard & follow'd now my aid besought
Her hour of death was near that hour of dread
She begged to see me ere her life was fled
Could I refuse - I could not tho' around
my eyes for such their will a scarf they bound
Wheel'd in a chaise thro' many a street we past
And in a sounding arch way stopped at last
Then [deletion]led into a [unclear][/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]while a lamp blazed bright[/insertion] the scarf removed
My eyes around a spacious chamber roved
doors oped & closed upon us while we trod
silent, mysterious some retired abode
