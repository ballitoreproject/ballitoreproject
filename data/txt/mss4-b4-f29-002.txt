My dear Aunt
to thee both for thy letter and thy
kind advice I am sorry to think thou would
imagine that I would be offended at thy
repoof. Yesterday a young man came I do not
know for what he was very obliging he told
My mother that he would give her
franks if she wanted them. to Morrow
I expect to see John and Agnes Cristy's place
as we intend to spend the day with them
we have our School in thee meeting house
now but we have no School a fifthday
morning as it would not be convenient
to the meeting. I must bid thee farewell
as I have no more to say so I remain thy
very affectionate Niece Deborah Leadbeater
