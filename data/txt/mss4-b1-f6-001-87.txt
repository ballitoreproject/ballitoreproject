Bristol July 31st 1789
My Dear Sir,
your kind favor of ye. 21st inst. I reced here
yesterday, and am happy to find you are safe arriv'd
and in good health after your tour - I am much oblig'd
to Mrs. Shackleton for her prescription, & to Miss Shackleton for
transcribing it, and have only to dread the almost certainty
I shall shortly have of trying its effect - with
respect to my brothers business, I have only to say that I believe
his intentions to be very honourable, & am concern'd he labour'd
under great uneasiness of mind, at not having it in his
power to discharge his bond to you, previous to his embarking
for Canada - his return from that country is very uncertain
he was well at sea on the 19th of last month, after being out
[unclear]five[/unclear] weeks - this intelligence came by an India Man, which
[unclear][/unclear] met (& wrote by) off ye. Azores - our claims in Ireland are
indubitable, and must very shortly be determined (and as yet
we have no reason to think otherwise [insertion]than[/insertion]) in our favour. - however
[unclear]shou'd[/unclear] the [underline]glorious uncertainty of the law[/underline] say otherwise, our
present property is not inconsiderable, and as it is the intention
my brother as well as myself to dispose of all property in Ireland
he will, or his Agent have it fully in their power to pay you.
shou'd any unforeseen accident happen my brother [deletion]and[/deletion] on that
died without a will, I shou'd [insertion]surviving him[/insertion] in such case be sole executor
and heir under my fathers deed of trust - and tho' I shou'd not
such circumstances be liable to one shilling of his debts
