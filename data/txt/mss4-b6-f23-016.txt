Dragg'd from the "suffocating stream" behold
That lifeless youth, & hear the Mother's moan:
Printing sad kisses on the clay-cold cheek,
She calls upon her son, her hope, her joy,
Staff of her widow'd age; whilst Reason reels
Beneath the blow [underline]which severs[/underline] Nature's tie!
Goodnature, thine was not the [deletion]useless[/deletion] [insertion]beautiful[/insertion] tear
Which unassisting falls, thy voice combines
Courage & Patience with the choicest lore
Which [unclear]Paan[/unclear] taught - the chosen band draws nigh,
Deep in its close recess the spark of life
Their search has found, with persevering skill,
Unwearied, undismay'd, their blessed task
The band, devoted to thy will, pursue;
While on their looks the trembling Mother hangs;
Begs [deletion]to hope that dared to breath[/deletion] [insertion]line better omitted[/insertion]
Now Doubt prevails, but onward press thy sons,
And keep Despair at bay, till they behold
The happy moment which rewards their zeal.
[deletion]Now[/deletion] [insertion]For[/insertion] through [deletion]th'extended[/deletion] [insertion]the[/insertion] veins [insertion]collapsed[/insertion] the sluggish [deletion]pulse[/deletion] [insertion]blood[/insertion]
Begins to flow, the heart has heav'd again,
The lungs resume their power, the quicken'd pulse
Now throbs responsive to the touch humane
The opening eye turns where the Mother stands,
And the lip speaks her name. But no reply

Salutes the ear - the agonies of joy
Convulse her frame, & struggle in her breast,
Till kindly nature pours the copious flood -
Delicious tears! - & oft her streaming eyes
Gaze on her Benefactors, then invoke
Blessings from [insertion]highest[/insertion] Heaven, [deletion]with silent eloquence[/deletion] [insertion]upon the heads[/insertion]
[unclear]Of[/unclear] those who bade her be a Mother still.
Thus when the Prophet to her eager arms
Restor'd her son, the pious Shunamite,
[deletion]With grateful rapture[/deletion] to her beating heart
Press'd her dear boy in silence; & retir'd!
[deletion]While with unutterable feelings press[/deletion]
Strain'd close her darling to her throbbing heart
and with unutterable feelings pray
In grateful silence eloquent, withdrew
Goodnature adds to soft fraternal love
True Heroism, while the beauteous boy
His tender skin distended & his form
Scarce human now the [deletion]helpless[/deletion] [insertion]hapless[/insertion] victim lies
Of dire small-pox, & death with chilling grasp
Prepares to seize his unresisting prey
Thy hand Goodnature ever prompt to save
Obeys thy clear discerning, steady eye
Not dimm'd by useless Pity. Thou beheldst
The spacious [unclear]Phanner[/unclear] &c
