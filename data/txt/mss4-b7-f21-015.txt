Patterdale Feb: 17 [underline]1801[/underline] /6
My Captain's sudden order to join his Regimt. not only hurrie[unclear][/unclear]
[unclear][/unclear]t every way discomposes me. - Yet, I cannot suffer him to depart,
[unclear]wi[/unclear]thout a line of best thanks to my dear Friend for her very kind [unclear][/unclear]
[unclear][/unclear] if any thing could tempt me to doubt her Sincerity, that very [unclear][/unclear]
[unclear][/unclear]ulds - either you flatter me, or have suffer'd the partiality of [unclear]y[/unclear]
[unclear][/unclear] towards me to influence your judgement - alas! my excelle[unclear][/unclear]
[unclear]F[/unclear]riend I feel conscious that I do not deserve the high opinion you
[unclear][/unclear] have form'd of me, & am really humbled by the terms in which
[unclear][/unclear]ou express it - Consider, the mischief you may thus do, to o[unclear]ne[/unclear]
[unclear]w[/unclear]ho looks for [underline]Truth itself[/underline], in all of your profession, - You Poets a
[unclear][/unclear]llow'd the language of compliment in Verse, but let me entrea[unclear]t[/unclear]
[unclear][/unclear] to exercise it in prose - I have been anxiously expecting to
[unclear][/unclear] hear from your Brother of your confinement, for I charged him [unclear][/unclear]
[unclear][/unclear] pain of my high displeasure not to neglect giving me the
[unclear][/unclear]arliest information of that event, as he continues silent, I concl[unclear][/unclear]
you are still up; & I own I envy Mrs.T. the pleasure of delivering this
scrawl to you - I need not add that my cordial good wishes attend[unclear][/unclear]
[unclear][/unclear]that it will give me sincere pleasure to hear of your safely
[unclear][/unclear] [unclear]Walk[/unclear] [unclear][/unclear] but he [unclear][/unclear]
[unclear][/unclear]now greatly I Esteem & admire him. he passed yesterda[unclear]y[/unclear]
[unclear][/unclear]s; & as usual, we talk'd much of you, & of our other Friends at Balli[unclear]tore[/unclear]
[unclear][/unclear] have promised to take all my Daughter's, & pass a Night at his House
[unclear]he[/unclear] has a great deal to show me, & we all enjoy his Society - I have only
[unclear][/unclear]ist seen his Sister, She may be very worthy, but I do not expect m[unclear][/unclear]
[unclear]a[/unclear]musement in her Company - From the opposite side of the [unclear][/unclear]

my abode appears to be such an enviable spot, that I enclose you a
little Drawing of it - but I do entreat, as a particular favor, that you
will not stick [insertion]it[/insertion] up [deletion]it[/deletion] on your Wall, & you will very much oblige me by
taking down those vile sketches you have hung up - No, my dear
Mary, the Queen of Patterdale & I shall never be on terms of intimacy,
[unclear][/unclear] cannot surmount her dislike of me, for never yet has she come
[unclear][/unclear] me, & I almost think I have banish'd her from Church, for she
[unclear][/unclear] never been there since the first Sunday I came - by the bye, your
[unclear][/unclear]tter gives me to understand (in spite of all the compliment withwhich
[unclear][/unclear] is deck'd) that there is a [underline]forbidding haughtiness[/underline] in my Manner to
strangers - if so, the Queen is right to dispise it - Let me set you
[unclear][/unclear]ight, my dear Friend, in one respect, if such is my manner, I have
[unclear][/unclear] "high birth" to justify it. My Father was a Gentleman, eminent in
[unclear][/unclear] Law, in which profession he might have made a large fortune, [unclear]instead[/unclear]
[unclear][/unclear]ich which he spent his paternal Estate, & I inherited little from him [unclear][/unclear]
but an expensive - & therefore wrongly thought, a good. Education; from
[unclear]an[/unclear] Uncle of my Mother's I had a large fortune; but neither that, or the
"high birth" with which you wish'd to excuse my Manner, could justify
my acting so, as to make you feel yourself ill at ease when I first
[unclear]Rece[/unclear]ived you, & I beg you to believe it was no consciously assumed -
[unclear][/unclear] You could not have convinced me more sharply of the continued
[unclear][/unclear]lity of your poor Mother's mind than by her [unclear]expression[/unclear] [unclear][/unclear]
[unclear][/unclear] that she seen herself, it would probably have been less
[unclear][/unclear]. My kindest wishes ever attend her, & your Sister, who I hope
is well, & in spirits equal to her task - Tell dear Mary Bewley
that I am healing all the Toes, & fingers, & strengthening every [insertion]weak[/insertion] back.
[unclear][/unclear]in the Vale (my own only excepted) with her excellent Plaister,
I am Physician in ordinary, & Surgeon extraordinary of Patterdale!
[unclear]should[/unclear] any illness happen at Court, I am persuaded I shod. [underline]be called in[/underline]
having already the honor of attending on some of her Majesty's nearest
relations, who place implicit confidence in my skill. I could make you
laugh with several ridiculous circumstances I have met with, in the
[underline]course of my practice[/underline], but I am not in a laughing humour - & you
must excuse a very incoherent, wretched scrawl - Mrs. Turpin chuses
to make use of the table on which I am writing, to pack up all her
Master's things, altho' there are three others in the room - so that she
does not improve the steadiness of my otherways shaking hand.
I told [insertion]her[/insertion] I wod. tell you - & she ansd. "I am sure Ma'am Mrs. Leadbeater will [unclear][/unclear]
it, pray give my duty to her" - I write any Nonsense to you, rather
than give way to the feelings of my heart at the present moment,
& I believe it is best to bid you farewell! Remember me affectionately
to all my Friends, I will write a line to Abraham if I can possibly
find time - if not, pray beg him to excuse me - May God bless, &
support you in your approaching hour of pain! prays very [unclear][/unclear]
[unclear][/unclear]
I shall hope to hear from you, when you are able -
[unclear][/unclear] shall hope to hear from you, when you are able -
but I can write to you no more, unless you will promise to burn my letters
& not to shew them to [underline]any one[/underline] - Tell my much esteem'd Lydia, I think I am
half offended, at least hurt, that she has never written me a single line.
So poor Great A is gone! what is become of little a? does she remain
at [unclear]Balin[/unclear]?
