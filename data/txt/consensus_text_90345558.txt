quiet manner -. At tea time
we obseved no less than five strange
faces all gentlemen except one who
was a [insertion]little[/insertion] girl and I found out afterwards
a sister to Arabella Matterson who was
here when we came but has since left.
8 Saturday - I have found out
the names of the new comers except
one - A lighthaird middle aged gentleman
of very bland manners [underline]most[/underline] polite
is a Mr Martin and evidently
on his first visit here
Then there is his next door neighbour
another middle aged person with
large whiskers who has often been
here before - comes periodically in the
Spring and Autumn when he is
threatened with something like bronchitis,
and finds a remedy here [underline]Mr Sullivan[/underline].
There is also an elderly gentleman
with very light hair and rather a
demure [insertion]half frightened[/insertion] expression named Blackwell -
There is also a tall interesting looking
young man dark brown hair blue eyes
