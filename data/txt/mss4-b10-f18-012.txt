My dear Mamma
I suppose you
will be surprized to find
that we have taken a
different course from
what we had intended
but after calling at Sherries
we found that Mr Gowan
could not be ready to
join us untill about

Saturday next at Larue
in Ireland, so to use
up the time we came
off here which Richard
seemed to like as he
never had been here
before - we arrived
here about one o'clock
in the morning, after
rather a tedious passage
we are all quite well
& I hope, so are you -
I want to get ready
to go to Church so must
say farewell - give my
dear love to Eliza & ask
her to write to me, &
I think she may run
Chances & direct to Larue
Ireland untill Saturday
next, [underline]that is[/underline], that I
suppose we will hardly
be there after that day
Love to Mary Gough &c -
ever your attached MJB
