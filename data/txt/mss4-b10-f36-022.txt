5th mo 14th 1833 Glendruid
My dear Eliza
I received thy letter and note per FW-
on second day evening, he seems very poorly not at
all well, he was not fit to leave the country to come
to business, my mother would not let him in early
the next morning which he wanted to do, but told
him he was not at all able to go to his business
and said it would be much better for him to go
down to the country with Isaac Gatchell, who is
in town and has asked him, I am sure I hope
he will do so. - We put him on a car at the [unclear]rock[/unclear] -
it was monthly meeting day but I [insertion]could[/insertion] [deletion]can[/deletion]not go in
in to it, a beautiful day it was, Richard & Elizth
drank tea with us on second day evening
Florence has had the cold but is better I expect,
E has also had it but seems pretty well again -
We have just come home from meeting that is
my Mother and I - I began this letter this
morning thinking I would have had it finished
in time for Richard to take in [insertion]to[/insertion] town, but was
called away as thou may perceive, he was gone
before we went to meeting, Frank is to be out to
day to recruit a little as he did not recover of

his cold yet he is to be with R&E in the cottage
I have very little news to tell we are all well
here as usual, down in the cottage. the Fenells
are to be out on seventh day next, I would not care
how soon they were come, as it is only an additional
care on my Mother to have the house unoccupied.
We have got a new bedstead and white curtains
for the back parlour, so thou may think it
looks much smarter than usual, I think there
is no other alteration made in it. E thinks they
are very snug in the cottage, indeed it looks very
comfortable they have the right room as we go in
at the hall-door for the parlour and the rooms
inside are bedrooms one their own and the other
for strangers the other large room they use as nursery,
one of the small E has settled up as a closet
and says she never was so comfortable that way
before. The other is the servants room, but sure thou
wilt see it all when thou comes home -
I believe I told thee in my last or in one of my
letters of M Shackletons intending to pay us a
visit which she has not yet fulfilled, I wrote
her a note but got no answer from her so I
cannot tell when she will come. we intend
putting her in thy room - Again have I
been interrupted by the arrival of Frank &

Lucy with the nurse and child, Sally [unclear]Horne[/unclear]
came also but she is down with Elizabeth. Lucy
goes goes back this evening and Frank stays - I hope
to send this in by her so came up to finish it, I feel
as if it was very stupid or as if [underline]I[/underline] was very stupid
thou wilt therefore excuse me from writing an
entertaining letter. I suppose the county about
Ballitore looks beautiful in its spring clothing the
Glen here is almost fully in leaf, I am sorry
to see it so forward, for then we will begin to
have sober summer directly - I think we might
have coddled gooseberries very soon now.
I am sorry to hear so dull an account
of Cousin Betsy but I hope going home
and the change of air may bring her
round in a short time wilt thou tell
her with my dear love I was sorry [deletion]not[/deletion] not being
able to see her again before she left town,
for I fully expected I should. It is raining
now smartly which will freshen every thing as it much
wanted about here, we having had none of any account
tho' there has been heavy rain in Dublin. Frank
told me wrote to thee yesterday and I suppose
told thee a great deal of news from the city,
they brought us out a large parcel from thee
which I opened expecting perhaps to find a
note but was disappointed finding only a muff

dirty clothes &c, I hope soon to hear from thee again
perhaps we may soon be expecting to see thee art
thou wishing to be home, to me it seems a long
time since thou went much longer than it really
is for I could scarcely believe it when some one
said the other day that was only two months.
My Mother desires her dear love and says that if
thou wishes it thyself she would be glad how soon
thou would come home but not to come by thyself
but to wait till a suitable opportunity
she dont wish to hurry thee but leaves it to thy
own option and at what ever time thou wishes

perhaps thou would like to stay a little while after Cousin
Betsy's return and it would be a pity for thee not to do so -
if thou wishes - give my love to Elizth and accept a
large share from thy affectionate sister Selina
write soon
