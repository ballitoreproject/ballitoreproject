My dear Elizth
I would by all means like to get some of thy
muslin, perhaps as much as would make 6 long frocks
but not too long & I think two of them would be quite
enough for thee to make & thou could send me
the remaing 2 cut out - I'm glad thou enjoys
[unclear][/unclear]F so much, James has been out all day except
that he call'd to say J Harvey was better; he goes
to the North tomorrow, but promises a longer
visit on his return, I write these few lines by
S Butler, I got thy sheet & am much obliged I enclose
a letter from Kitty which I wd thank thee
to forward, I would not desire any but plain
work - ever thine SB
how did M Farmers visit [insertion]to town[/insertion] turn
out?
