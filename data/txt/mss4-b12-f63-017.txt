Dear little [unclear]dotey[/unclear] Sister Tete
I received thy
very welcome letter
which on account of
Willy not giving it to
me when he got it I could
not answer it any sooner.
I hope thou art getting on well
with thy lessons Willy is
teaching me vergil.

Dada is out in Fassaroe
I expected him in this evening
but he did not come in.
thou must be very lo[deletion]a[/deletion]n[insertion]e[/insertion]some
without Polly. I b[insertion]e[/insertion]lieve she
is going down to Dunlavin
on a visit I hope she will
enjoy her-self. Will was
down at the barlow meeting
he said that he spent a very
pleasant time there. I am
very lonesome here Avy
never comes in to pay
me a visit. I suppose
thou hast not much
time to do any thing.

now as thou art in the
first class in everything
I have just let the men
in that have to stay
up all night. Pat Henry
has just come to the door
for some key to give to
Alley Doyle . Although
thou may think I am
engaged in the place
all the salary I get is at
my dinner. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
William says that all those
!!! (what ever thou calleth
them.) are celery stalks.

 I remain thy aff- Brother

Dear friend
I hope thou art
getting on very well. I do not
like strangers to come here
at all. I had a great hunt
after a mouse to day
up in the paper room
but did not katch it
a little boy came into
the shop to day with a
mouse in a cage, and I
almost broke my nose
trying to katch it.
several of my fellow
[unclear][/unclear] pay me visits
but I do not like them
at all I remain yours -
monkey
