Richmond 21st of 8th month 1823.-
My dearest Sarah
A letter from my mother yesterday
alarmed me about thee - she tells me that my father
says thou looks thin, not well & art low spirited, my
beloved sister let me not hear of thee [deletion]thus[/deletion] in this
round about way - but write to me or get Edward
to write & say how thou art - whether thou wilt
again seek thy native air - or whether thou could
possibly try ours - Oh! that I might think of such
a thing - as having thee here - but I suppose I
may not - And poor Ballitore will be desolate to
us indeed if when we see it next E & D will be
away, - I do not like the thought of going there
now - I have not the ardent feeling I had or
the burning wish of seeing it - I can only think of
it with tears & they are bitter enough - I am daily
expecting to hear something of or from thee by
Josiah Gough - Poor Eliza I hope she may be comfortable
where she is, & I fear she will not - I
pity her sincerely, for I think her so worthy
& deserving of a less severe fate. I wish I would
not be wishing - but every thing I hear of thee makes
me more long that I too lived in Dublin - Happy
as I am I cannot help desiring that I had a
person I could fly to as I would to thee. but oh! my
I should not repine - while I have health & comfort

Poor Deborah! Could any one be more happily situated
among her friends - with such a husband - but
see relentless sickness banishes her from all but
that darling man - & she can not be unhappy
while she has him. - I could not tell thee how
sorely I was disappointed when I found that E &
D- could not come here before they sailed - I wish
I could see them - but I can not. My Grandmother
is very poorly - & will not I think hold much
longer. - her increased illness prevented Sally
from accompanying Hannah. Richard is
here & it gives me great delight - but oh! all
the home faces will soon be gone, & when
shall I see them again! - Well! next summer
perhaps - I am not one given long to despair.
Tell me about my [underline]mijnonette Marguerite[/underline] - I think
of her & make others think of her almost continually -
Describe her to me in short petticoats - for I enjoye
she is bobbed - & like the little woman whom
tailor Doubt so unmercifully curtailed. - & I fear
for her cap as I am not there to ward off
the [underline]decapitation[/underline] oh shocking! - I won't close
this till I hear whether J. Gough is come.
I have a great secret, but I can not tell it -
Some say that is half telling it. - Really I
I have a great many plans about her.

grow quite pleasant chatting to thee - & I began
"with a [underline]frown[/underline] on my lip & a tear in my eye"
I wish my honey! thou would try the same experiment -
perhaps it might gayify thee. & it
certainly would me, to hear from thee. I intend
to rouse Edward with a paper ratan, one of
these days & give him a great tickling - Give
him my dear love now, & tell him I am out
with him, for not coming to Ballitore or at least
not writing to me since - & he may expect a
great scolding. - Have the boys any notion
of coming to Killarney - encourage them to it
& say it would give me great pleasure to see
them & show them Doonas & Clarerise
& many other fine things. -
They partly promised & the whole
house expects them. Goodbye for the present
I'll soon send thee the purse.
I must say farewell! I envy thee
the power of seeing E & D before they go away.
Ever thy
LJF
