My dear Elizth - I seem at last as if I were really
going to Ballitore I would not wonder if you were
all angry with me for not answering your
letters but I have been greatly puzzled between
my longing to see you & my cares at home
& my illness, so that I could fix on nothing
decidedly & even now Margts hooping cough has
come in an ill time for my plans she coughs
a good deal so that I cannot think of having
her with me, - It was very kind of [unclear][/unclear]
father to offer to send the chaise to Nan [unclear][/unclear]
us, which makes the journey much easier
to us all, I was think the boat would be
the best way to take the young child [deletion]&[/deletion] if it
would not be unreasonable to ask my father
to send to Sallins instead of Naas for us
I am not certain whether we shall go on 7th or 1st day
if either of these days be inconvenient or if Sallins
is to far for the horses please to say so that
we may act accordingly, I hope nothing
may prevent this long expected long
wish'd for movement - with dear love
to my father I remain thy affect sister SB
