[unclear]Wathy[/unclear] the fishers irish heart [[unclear]savory[/unclear]]
who, when he gave the [deletion]pretty[/deletion] [unclear]weal[/unclear]
Repaid reward with friendly thumb
[deletion]Now[/deletion]
And homeward now they take their way
Outspread the vale before them lay
while the broad suns departing light
Beam'd in the vale in beauty bright
Oh twas in truth a glorious sight
[deletion] [/deletion] the pleasant day was
sweetly closed
Sweetly the party had reposed
Then spread forth a new born day
[deletion]But doom'd[/deletion] destind to witness due [insertion]during[/insertion]
[deletion]& plied with rapine & with blood[/deletion]
that path where careless gay & free
Past by our happy company
the fierce maurades now has [unclear]lost[/unclear]
and stained with rapine & with blood
now memory takes a backward flight
and scenes departed leap to light

Willm.. Leadbeater

Sweet breath'd the Spring sweet smiled the morn
It seem'd a day for pleasure born
The gay barouche stood at the gate
Four prancing steeds impatient wait
To whisk away a precious freight
All seated now while joy inspires
Four lovely dames two lovely [insertion]gentle[/insertion] Squires
I sing not how their venturous way
They took along the mountain gray
[deletion]deep Neal laugh all undismayd[/deletion]
I sing not of the halt they made
Nay deep Neal laugh all undismayd
Tho' [deletion]his[/deletion] [insertion]on[/insertion] ground [insertion]remain[/insertion] [deletion]laph[/deletion] convey high
His laugh soar'd in [unclear]midette[/unclear] sky
Nor can my simple numbers tell
Of that enchanting woody dell
Thro' wch. with highland heath they wind
And leave the desart drear behind
Inspiring reverence & delight
When burst the Castle on their sight
To pains their feeling or define
Belongs not to a lay of mine
yet and heaves the gentle heart a sigh
[unclear]Indignant pains [/unclear]the manly eye
This tribute while thy towers they view
Illustrious [unclear]Raligh[/unclear] is thy due
[unclear]Owntly[/unclear] there a better fate
The victim of [unclear]Iberias[/unclear] hate
Dismantled lay this ancient tower
Now [unclear]strains[/unclear] again a friendly [unclear][/unclear]
And Devon's youthful Duke shall come
And with his presence grace the dome
There the Blackwater will along
Dishonour not his waves my song
while yet his life [unclear]with[/unclear]
For [insertion]honour[/insertion] Burke harmonious gay & fair
His lovd Blackwater praises sung
Now could picture in my lays
That pair who for [unclear][/unclear]
