My dear E
Fanny Lefina call'd to day she
was disappointed in going yesterday but
intends going in the early Coach on 2nd day
that is the 9 o'clock if she is ready if
not then may expect her in the Cork Mail
at 11 or 12, o'clock at night she talk'd
of lodging at the Inn but I thought thou
would rather wait up for her -
Little Henry who is as small a child [unclear][/unclear]
think as ever I saw is living & likely
to live [unclear]Parse[/unclear] cannot go home for a
month as the child is so small it would
not be fit to travel sooner it is a little
girl I write in great haste with Fanny's
message [unclear]Eder[/unclear] thinks that the printing
may be done next year so much has
been laid out already this year however
do as thou thinks lest [unclear]Jarila[/unclear] hears the chime
ever thy SB
