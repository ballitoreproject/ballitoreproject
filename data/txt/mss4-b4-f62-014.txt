My dear sister,
Bewley seeming to wish me to pay a debt of this kind,
& I liked [underline] this time [/underline] for it, while our separated family
were again uniting. Thy not getting to town to the meeting
was a greater disappointment to many, than thy
diffident mind would suppose; the above MB was a
good deed so: - but perhaps it was best as if was &, that [underline]this[/underline]
bitter was [underline]also[/underline] necessary for us. That little Thos.. of thine
has caused thee some trouble, I hope he may yet gladden
thy heart. It was extraordinary I do think that Anna
was able to get to the meeting here, but sure she is altogether
an extraordinary creature: Susy's perserverance
in [underline]waiting[/underline] &c:&E: is also out of the common tract, I do
think it proves the ground of [underline]her [/underline]heart to be good. I
make no doubt but (suppose several of thy "little hurries
are past") thou wilt have plenty of one thing or other
to engage thee, I wish thee not to be over perplexed with
these matrimonial cares, I grudge to have thee swallowed
up in them, & heartily wish & long for thee a while at
the Retreat, if it would not depress thee much being
there. As to thy not writing, (tho' I love to get a letter
Dublin: 18/5 mo: 1793,
Thy last found me here, dear Molly
from

from thee) I never, I can honestly say, think hard of thy
silence, I know thou [underline] wert [/underline] used to returns, which now
cannot be, wch. did no doubt induce thee to write when
perhaps otherwise thou would have had but little relish
for it. I suppose the poor trades people here, [underline]are [/underline]in a very
dismal way for want of work &c; Sammy Bewley with some
others have been rummaging about amongst the miserable
habitations of some of these, taking their names, & endeavouring
to get something done towards relieving them. I
had a curious sort of an adventure since the meeting, it
was pretty much thus; recollecting one evening that poor
Mary Katthren's was near a trying time, ([underline]thou knowest[/underline]) &
that she seemed almost friendless, I wrote her a note "that
altho' our intimacy was broken in upon, I was ready
to render her what asistance was in my power at [underline]this[/underline]
time, if she wished for, & sent for, me": it required no answer,
– but in a few days after, say on [insertion]a[/insertion] fifth-day her husband
came for me in the morning, I found her up &
walking about, not well but in good spirits; - I left her
& in the evening went again, she [insertion]was[/insertion] much the same, I
returned, but was sent For about 10 at night, [deletion]cousin[/deletion]
Molly Bewley pittied me to be going alone so came
with me, we staid with her all night, & a dreary night
of

of pain it was to her, I believe she had not 5 minutes
ease nor one wink of sleep all night: – the Dr. sat up
till near 4 in the morning, then went to bed, – sixth-day
instead of going to meeting we staid with her, & about
2 o'clock in the afternoon the little girl, was born, the
mother going through great agony; – is mending well,
seemed filled with thankfulness when the child was
born, – poor thing I fear those impressions may soon
were off. Since this Abby Knott & Sally Warpole have
each had a child, - but I had not the distress
of seeing them in pain. Molly & I are going
to tea to Wm. North's, & 6 o'clock being near
I must bid thee (my beloved sister Margt.)
This family, did they know
of my writing, would send
love to thee & brother I believe:
mine dearly to him &c: &c:
Affectionately farewell,
S: Shackleton.
