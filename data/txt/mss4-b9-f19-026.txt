My dear Elizabeth - As my mother does not think it
fair to send a frank empty she has set us all to work, to try to
fill it, I dreamt of Richard last night thought he was at home
with us & look'd just as I remember him long ago his eyes sparkling
with the delight of seeing us all I am in great hopes he
will be let to come home this summer, perhaps
may both come together Yesterday evening my mother T Fisher
& I went to see the opposition school we found it well furnish'd
clean quiet & in good order, Owen Finn schoolmaster both boys
and girls are in the same apartment till they fit up an outhouse
for the girls they have got reading & spelling cards, slates, ruled
paper, & most excellent desks, there were 80 children present
this school may do much good in spiritting up the teachers in the
other school & in opening the purses of our neighbours the
children learn their catachism ninght & morning every
day, Mary & Ann have got little M A Houghton to live with
them for the benefit of attending school she spent first day
evening [deletion]with[/deletion] at Wm Wrights & next morning [deletion]where she[/deletion]
she said to my father "I said to the man last night you are
a pleasant man like Wm. Leadbeater" "What man" said my
father, "Wm Wright", she is a pleasant gay little thing
& I think will greatly improve by being under
M & A's care Deborah busy getting her home Whitewash'd

H Barrington was taken suddenly
ill last 9th day & is but slowly recovering
the Doctor thinks she's paralytic, poor
Poll Gore is no more she was
buried without a coffin & I hear that
all that family leave us the same
way SL
For
Elizabeth Leadbeater
