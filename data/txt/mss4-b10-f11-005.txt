Glendruid June 1823
My dear John
I have begun a letter [insertion]to you[/insertion] because I think their will
not be so much of the same thing over again in it.
I often think when I am in bed, that I will try to
amend myself and try to be good, but when
it comes to the trial, I go back to my old way
again. Eliza Gough was reading for Lucy and
[deletion]me[/deletion] [insertion]I[/insertion] the other day some of Hannah Mores works
on dissipation, and Genious. I liked it very well
I think I shall buy it [insertion]for[/insertion] myself to read whenever
I like. Do you know whether the Grecian history
is in the library. I should like to read it, I
have read the Roman history; what wicked
men some of the emperors were, especially Nero

 who delighted [deletion]to[/deletion] [insertion]in[/insertion] putting people to death only because
they were good, I supose you know the story of Paetus
and Ar[insertion]r[/insertion]ia, so I need not tell it to you. I dont
intend to read Agripina util I go into town.
We took a pleasant walk to the sea yesterday [insertion]Friday[/insertion].
E Gough Lucy Selina Arthur [deletion]and[/deletion] Frederick and
I it was a very clear day the mountains and [insertion]sea[/insertion]
looked beautiful, we saw two steam packets
one coming in and the other going out, we staid
about an hour and a half, picking up stones.
I think when Mr Keightly comes that I
will learn Italian and French well before
I begin any other language, I would
rather know two languages well than know
them all little. I should like to know mathematics

very well, I suppose Mr Ke[insertion]i[/insertion]ghtly [deletion]knows[/deletion]
knows them. I would have sent this in on
 Monday only I had not it [insertion]quite[/insertion] finished
I remain your affectionate sister Emily
I hope the next will be longer
