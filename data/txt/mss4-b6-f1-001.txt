My dear Cousin Molly perhaps will be surprised to
find that I am got to Lancaster so soon after my
arrival, I am not sorry tho', as it gives me an
opportunity of seeing Frd. Jacob, Robt. Watson, and
Molly - they came to Town on second day, are come
to spend the evening with Cousin Bradford, I have
stole from them to converse a little with thee
my dear Girl - J. Jacob proposes leaving Lancaster
early tomorrow morning, I doubt not but he will be
kind enough to take the trouble of this and one
for Cousin Sally if I have time - Cousin Aby, Debby
and Peggy must give me credit a while longer
I dont believe tho' that I am in debt to Cousin
Peggy - had I time I should not mind that, at
present I have not - shall now give thee my
reason for being here - Cousin John Bradford
has been much indisposed, not likely to continue
long - my Cousin Molly partly owing to her concern
for her [unclear][/unclear] Parent & [unclear]ment[/unclear] has been poorly

also, she earnestly [unclear]requested[/unclear] my company for a few weeks
her Father & Mother joined her in it, I could not
[unclear]easily[/unclear] refuse them - the alteration in her look affected
me greatly, she is thin, and much paler than usual
they were very apprehensive of a decline, I hope she is
something better - her Father is very feeble, yet was
enabled to sit all the meetings during their Quarterly
meeting which was held here last week -
Jane Routh is well and desired her dear love to your
Family when I wrote to Ballitore - she lives about
half a mile from Cousin Bradford- - we visit her
often, tis a pleasant walk - Cousin Aby gave
me a very pleasing acct. of thy Aunt Carleton,
please give my dear love to her, also to Cousin Peggy
and remember me respectfully to Cousin Saml. Carleton
and James & Nanny - excuse haste and write soon
to thy very affectionate Cousin
