Lisburn June 26th 1810
What, my dear Friend, can be the matter
at Ballitore. Surely my dear Betsy must be ill or
I would have had a letter from her since my return
home. Indeed I have been very uneasy at not hearing
from you for so long a time, & what increases my uneasiness
is, that Mary Shackleton in a letter to my
sister Betsy says that she has not heard from home
lately. May I request thee, my dear friend, to let me
know if it is the illness of any person at Ballitore
that prevents me from hearing from you; or if thee
has not leisure perhaps my sweet Deborah would be
so kind as to write to me. I am afraid that Betsy
is ill because she had a bad cold when we left
Ballitore. We found Lisburn nearly
deserted. All our acquaintances were just preparing
for a summer excursion; some to the sea, & some to
Ballinahinch Spa. I have been very busy since I came
home, as I found a great many domestic affairs wanted
to be arranged on our return; & as our friends
were leaving town & my cousins the Bradshaw's of
Milecross on a visit here, we have seldom been a
day without company - So that my time has been very

fully occupied. I think that my Father's health has been
very much improved by our jaunt to Leinster, altho'
he is sometimes painfully reminded that his old acquaintance
the rheumatism has not forgotten him. Poor
William has had a severe toothache - He got his tooth
pulled yesterday & went immediately to the bleachgreen
where he staid for some hours, & today his face is so
much swelled that he is confined to the house.
We have been in Belfast since our return home
to dine with Dr. Drennan - I think you would admire
Mrs. Drennan very much. She has very pleasing manners
joined to a highly cultivated understanding - As I had
heard that we were to have a [underline]literary[/underline] company I
determined to be very silent, & to lay in a great
store of information & instruction; but unfortunately
for my resolution of silence the Doctor requested me
to sit next him at dinner, & a chair was immediately
left for me between him & my friend Mrs. Williamson
who I suppose Betsy remembers to have seen in Lisburn.
The Doctor began to ask me what I thought
of Scott's poems & several other books I had read - We
then had a long discussion on travelling, fine views,
the Giants causeway &c - He told me some curious
anecdotes of some of his acquaintances who had been to
visit the causeway - Two young ladies said it was [underline]very[/underline]
[underline]neat[/underline], & [underline]very snug[/underline] - Another party enjoyed the delightful

prospects along the coast to the causeway, by
playing cards as they travelled in a coach.
Has thou ever read M Hay's Female biography.
I read it more than a year ago & I have been reading
it again since I came home, with very great pleasure.
I think biography is a most interesting study; it gives
such different views of human nature - Some characters
[deletion]continually[/deletion] made themselves unhappy by continually
anticipating some misfortune, never looking at the
pleasing side of a prospect, & determining to be pleased
& contented with their situation - I am not an advocate
for the [underline]superiority[/underline] of either sex, I only plead for an
[underline]equality[/underline] - I think few persons after reading Female
biography & reflecting on the genius &[unclear] information[/unclear]
of [unclear][/unclear] different characters, would be inclined to
join Pope's illiberal censure when he says
Nothing so true as what you once let fall
Most women have no characters at all;
Matters too soft a lasting mark to bear,
And best distinguish'd by black, brown, or fair,
Some men to business, some to pleasure take,
But every woman is at heart a rake.
I think a great deal of mischief is done by reading
novels rather than useful & instructive books - Novels
should not be made a standard for conduct through life,
as they give such a false idea of real life, & every book
tending to implant sentiments of the omnipotence &
usefulness of love & beauty contains a dangerous poison
to a young or unreflecting mind - Nothing can be more
distant from the quiet, rational & [deletion][/deletion] useful qualities
of a well educated female than the excellencies of the heroine
his plays would be very superior to what they now are. In contrasting
the writings of Shakespear's time & the present time we certainly
have reason to congratulate ourselves on living in a better period
of the world. Please give dear love to S Shackleton & tell
her that her Moyallon friends are very well, & that M Dawson is
so well that she is paying a visit at Fair View - I hope thee
sometimes thinks of the request I made the day before I left
Ballitore - With dear love to all the amiable family at Griese
bank L White Elizabeth Deborah I am most sincerely thy
very affectionate
S Hancock
Betsy desires her love to you all
Give a great many dear loves from me
to Betsy Shackleton & tell her that I intend
sending her a bundle by the next magazines to Carlow - please tell
her also that I intend sending her two guineas soon which I have
received for gloves since I came home -

of a novel. Altho' I think it is wrong to attach an idea of
consequence to beauty, yet it is very natural for a handsome
person to be vain - at least I think I know enough of my own
disposition to be certain that if I were handsome I would be
vain, & on that account I have often rejoiced that I had not
the smallest pretensions to beauty - I could not have the approbation
of my own mind if I were vain, & how much
better it is to have the approbation of our own hearts than
the applause of the whole world. I have often thought that
it was education that laid the foundation of the improvement
of the female mind, & on this depends our character either
for frivolity or useful knowledge thro' life - I do not mean
by education the mere routine of school training, but the
result of reflection from the first dawn of reason until
we cease to exist - I have been reading Shakespear
on my Father's recommendation - Shakespear's taste was not
equal to his genius, but his knowledge of the human heart was
great - If he had lived in these days of refinement in writing
