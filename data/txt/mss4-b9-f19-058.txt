Britain street 9th of 5th mo 1823
My dear Elizth
I know thou art anxious to hear
how we get on here, particularly thy little charge,
the poor little thing is sadly teazed with the
eruption, which we take to be the Itch, I sent
for S Doyle to consult her about it & she also
[deletion]thought it[/deletion] thinks it is this [deletion]unpleasant[/deletion] [insertion]vulgar[/insertion] disorder
that ails her but thinks she will be well soon
she seems quite well otherwise & is very gay
but is chiefly kept in the nursery, Jane Thos
call'd here to day and ask'd to see Margt. so
I took her to the nursery & she said that nurse
had no itch & that we need not be at all
uneasy, now thou hast the two sides of
the question, I thought we look'd very
lonely after you were gone but a letter
from Eben set us in motion to get things

ready for him, & Deb; we moved up stairs &
now sleep in the little room next the nursery
& put E & D in one room - Deb look'd better than
I expected to have seen her, having such dull accounts
latterly - How is Betsy ah how pleasant & gay
she was I hope you had an agreeable journey
& that we shall soon hear that you had, from
thyself Edw & Richd. are playing chess, so
thou may know that it is evening with as
Deb is resting on the sofa, Eben out, did
any letter dome from [unclear]Zd;[/unclear] since thou went home
we got none, how did thou find my mother
& her works? I hear the house was beautifully
clean - poor Nancy gets on tolerably well
with us, I have to stay in the kitchen a
good deal trying to teach her, I hope she
she will do well - Nurse quiet & easy
[deletion]now[/deletion] as usual, give my dear love to father
& mother & Aunt Sally & M Doyle I hope MD
has recover'd before [unclear]this[/unclear], & that [unclear]HN[/unclear] is better
ever thine SB
