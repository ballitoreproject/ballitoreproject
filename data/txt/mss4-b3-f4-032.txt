My dear Uncle

	I received thy salutary & affectionate letter of the 16th of last month for which am obliged  Thy intelligence respecting dear M.R. & J.W. was quite new & joyous to many here  other parts of said letter were words fitly spoken but alas with other intimations not less sacred, they fell not in ^to^ thoroughly prepared ground & consequently have not yeilded [sic] acceptable fruit  My mind is thereby disqualified from the comfortable communion even this way to be enjoyed  That the father chastens is all the consolation I at present possess & for this salutary though painful proof of being under heavenly care my heart bows in gratitude, reverence & fear  But this ^is^ a subject of privacy & perhaps of most consequence to myself than any other +  I hint at it by way of apology for filling this sheet with extracts from interesting letters lately received which nevertheless are superior in intrinsic value to anything my store house might produce were I of my best fashion for writing & which I hope be accepted by thy generous mind as a letter in course therefore after telling

Congenies 23rd of 11th month 1789
Dear Friend RG/

After several troubles & conflicts of mind occasioned by my delay to give myself up where my heart called me, thro the fatigues dangers & affliction [illegible] this kingdom I have found sweet peace in submitting to the will of him who alone is worthy of all our confidence and homage; and i have the satisfaction to find in the journey several favorable opportunities to make known our principles and to give testimony to the light, principally with a Doctor & a Prior. In coming down the Rhone our great boat got on a sand bank where we remained for 13 hours in which time we were much fatigued, but thro favor we got off without accident, & on the 19th of this month I arrived happily in this country. I passed before my mothers door and I did not feel liberty to see her until I had visited the friends of Congenies & the school, also attended their meetings for worship.
I cannot express to thee how sensibly this deprivation affected me. I went to Calvission [?] where I saw L. M. senior; from thence I went to Congenie [sic], where I was received with tender affection Louis Majolier and the other friends; the same evening we felt our hearts disposed to meet together before the Lord, we were a pretty considerable number & our meeting was rejoicing; our souls having been refreshed by several exhortations and giving of thanks to the Almighty, during which the friends of Ireland and England were remembered with a lively tenderness. The 21st I visited more particularly our school, it consists of 14 children who are day scholars & 5 boarders from Giles, and that neighbourhood

I was inwardly satisfied with the pious manner in which they read before me in the Dying Sayings, about the half of them read several passages with facility. I was particularly astonished by the progress of those who knew nothing before their coming to school. All was conducted with order & decency. They appear to me to be treated with propriety & simplicity and to observe during school and meals that silence so precious to the preservation of innocence, and to the promotion of inward feelings
22nd First day of the week there was a meeting at 10 oclock in the morning, which was edifying and comforting. I rejoiced to feel that it was gathered in a good degree of solemnity and that the few words which were delivered were strengthening and under the influence of the internal Guide
Many friends from Giles, Calvisson, Nage, Caudonnian, and other places came there and joined us in the evening meeting. To this last, came of his own accord a minister of Gage, of the sect of Calvin. I was concerned to mention before him the inutilty of the baptism of children with elementary water and to supplicate the Almighty to enlighten the understandings of our enemies to have mercy upon them, and to influence their minds in such a manner that we may one day become one people and only one family submissive to his eternal will.
The minister Valentine was affected therewith, and our religious silence, during the meeting he was grave and serious, he rose and uncovered during prayer and conducted himself with decency and moderation. After the meeting I felt a desire to approach him and give him my hand [page 3] he said he was satisfied with our principles, that he had read the works of Pen [sic] and many others with sympathy and that he was sorry he had known them too late. I answered him there is yet time for thee to unite thy self to the Lord and to hear his voice in the bottom of thy soul. We conferred touching baptism and he concluded by saying that tho he was not entirely convinced; he adopted a great part of our principles, and that he had a great desire to see me to confer more particularly with me on many subjects. I answered that I consented with pleasure. He took my address and gave me his, and he quitted me with marks of esteem and friendship.
	Today I felt a desire to go and visit him myself that we may thro divine assistance profit by the fresh openness which appeared to influence him yesterday evening. LM is inclined to accompany me. I dont know at present how it shall please Providence to dispose of me in future. But, I hope that he is preparing in this country a great work and I have confidence that your religious visit hath much contributed to it.

From L.M.
Congenies 13th of 12th month 1789
	John Marcillac wrote a letter to thee from this place of which I had knowledge: hoping that this letter will have reached thee I will not enter into the details which are there made concerning his arrival amongst us, the situation & order of our school, the circumstance of the minister at Gage, Valentine &c. I will only tell thee that after said letter was written, I went with our friend Marcillac to visit this person at his own house he seemed to receive us with cordiality and affection, we discoursed upon divers religious matters, and he made no objection, but to ^on^ the contrary he acquiesced to all the points of truth which Marcillac opened to him. We separated agreably, and he finished by repeating to us the same words which he said at the going out of our meeting. That he was sorry he had not known our principles sooner: we only observed to him that it is always time for the Lord when the heart is sincere & well disposed. In short I have learnt that since our visit he has held advantageous & agreeable discourse on our account, signifying his satisfaction with [blot] us and perhaps even his desire to participate of the truth.
	A week after the arrival of JM we went in company with him ^[illegible]^, Peter Marignan and my aunt Magdeline ^& I^ to visit the friends of Gilles we had two meetings which were comfortable
	John Marcillac is actually I presume at Montpellier about outward affairs he gave us to expect he would come and visit again as well as the friends here about the latter end of this month. The fidelity of to his witness ^testimony^ as well inwardly as outwardly penetrates us with a great [words crossed out] ^respect^ from him and at the same time with confusion for us ^ourselves^ who are yet so weak  [corrections in Sarah Grubbs handwriting]

	In a letter from L.M. to SRG he says I have been interrupted in writing my letter by the visit of the minister Valentine, he came about some books that I had promised to lend him  he staid more ^above^ an hour with me & we had more conversation upon religious subjects in which we concurred  He asked about your visit to this country & he shewed regret at not being a partaker of it  I understand (not from himself but some other protestants) that last first day he informed his assembly that that was the last day he would preach among them  From the disposition he manifested to me I have no reason to doubt it

From R. Jones to SRG
Philadelphia 10th month 8th
	Do acknowledge for me the receipt of letters from dear R & E Shackleton I mean to answer them ere long  I have also a joint letter from that Ballitore Prince RS & his precious children A & S do say to them that I feel them near to my spirit in that which is unchangeable & therein I salute them & their connexions as if names. When I was at the quarterly meeting at Rahway which is attended mostly by a vast concourse of people of various descriptions (who often get into companies before & after meeting frolicking horse racing, sailing & other foolish acts of levity & riot) our dear friend Thomas Scattergood had in the meeting a remarkable time by way of solemn warning & mentioned some recent instances of sudden death in the midst of these practices. He was earnest in entreaty that after that meeting they might go quietly to their own houses & not get into parties of pleasure by which they might draw down divine displeasure Yet oh sorrowful to relate, the next day 27 of both sexes hired a boat to take them to Sandy-hook where they went to bathe & the sea coming gast up so covered a point of Land they had to come upon to get back to their boat that they got intimidated & went off the Point 11 of them into the sea of whom only 4 were saved & the others were drowned the bodies of 4 of them being lovely young women were brought to Rahway & after the coroners Inquest sat all were buried in one great a great multitude of people attending where T.S. had again close & deep labour  Please to note but one of the 4 were members of our society but the relatives of the other 3 requested they might all be buried in friends burying ground  Last week by a fall I 
strained the leaders in my left leg so that I have been disabled from walking even ^about^ the house since  a disorder like the influenza hath made great progress in about a week, scarce a family ^with^ about it  I was never more reduced in same length of time as with it but am now gaining strength  Besure give my love to those precious plants E Pim & S. Shackleton whose dedication of soul is like marrow to my bones may they approve themselves skillful workwomen
	Dear H Catherall [?] says
Our usual solemnity (as some term it was [sic close parentheses missing] unusually large & some sittings so evidently owned with the covering of holy Good as not only to cement afresh together in the pure covenant of love & life but bowed many minds in the humble returns of thanksgiving & praise  Truly rejoicing to many among us was the return of our dear J.P. & J.T. more especially to behold the abundant oneness humility & love with which they are cloathed [sic]  we spent this afternoon with dear MR & J Watson at J Pembertons their home  They arrived this day about noon & appear well & cheerful  They feel very near me
