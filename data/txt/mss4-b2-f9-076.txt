Ballitore: 29/1 month 1786.

My dear cousin,

	It seems a long while since thou & I exchanged a line -- Thy Peggy & my Molly converse sometimes in this manner -- I am very well pleased that they do -- but neither would I have us leave undone -- I love thy epistolary communications, where-ever I meet with them -- they are so free, unaffected & informing -- The friendship also cemented I hope among our children gives me pleasure -- They have all I trust chosen the good part -- & as they suffer the holy leaven to sanctify their dispositions, inclinations & all their faculties, they may some of them in a future day, when our heads are laid low, & our spirits in their allotted mansions, be perhaps engaged together in the service of Truth, a service the most humiliating & yet most honourable of any -- a right preparation for it brings down into great abasedness of self, is accompanied by many humbling baptisms, & leads into deep & various sufferings -- yet is the service the highest, the noblest, the best, & most desirable, which can possibly fall to human lot. All good things are involved in it -- & nothing that is essentially good respecting either time, or eternity, will be with-held from those, who faithfully, honestly & diligently persevere (through divine help) to the ends. So that I wish us young & old to be encouraged in our several departments in the Lords work, looking steadily to him for daily support & supplies, that so his favour may encompass us as a shield & his blessing may fall as dew about our habitations -- There are many visited youth up & down, on whom the Gospel-rain has plenteously descended, & yet there is a great scarcity of lively, active members in the church, who have received gifts from the holy head, & are occupying them to the edification of the body -- I think its well worth while to contemplate the cause -- I fear with many there is a looking to the clouds more than to him that filleth the clouds; a desire after fugitive, temporary streams, rather than a seeking to dwell at the fountain-head -- they love the society & communications of the servants; but they are not humbled enough in heart; so as willingly to expose themselves, & to be seen sitting at the Masters feet, bathing them with their tears, & wiping them with the hairs of their head. however, though this may be the case with many, I rejoice in the hope & belief that ^there^ are still preserved divers in advanced age, fresh & green, trees full of sap & bearing fruit in their season; as well as a considerable number of the rising generation, who have given up their names, have received the earnest penny & are enlisted members of the militant church -- these feel it to be necessary that they should learn each their own exercise, wear the uniform appointed for them, keep their ranks in righteousness, shew themselves apparelled, decent & clean before their captain, & be obedient to the word of command: these are careful to be good ensamples [sic] to one another, & I wish we who are elder may be careful to walk as good ensamples to them.
	Its glad tidings to hear that our brother James is likely to recover: his loss would be severely felt by us all -- May his spirit have been still more purified by this dispensation, more weaned & unhinged from the world, & still more devoted to the cause of Christ! Please give mine & my wifes dear love to him, when thou hast opportunity -- & also to his wife, Cousin Richard Pike & his wife -- We are glad to hear more pleasing accounts of her -- we feel ourselves much interested in her welfare, on divers accounts -- Poor Anna Taverner remains confined to the bed, afflicted -- but not forsaken either by that hand, which (doubtless wisely, though to us wonderfully) has seen meet to chastise; or by kind, affectionate friends, who suffer much with her & by her. We were expecting thy son James & his sister Becky would have made this their way to Limerick (partly to have seen Anna), but were disappointed -- Indeed at the time when they would have been likely to be here, Anna was in such a state as that she & Becky could have had but little satisfaction by being together. Perhaps James will give us a call on his return. He should I think have wrote to us from Dublin or Naas, when they altered their measures -- because we expected them -- but Ill forgive him the first fault -- for his wifes sake -- or leave him to her to document him when they meet. Poor things -- I wish them all happiness together. They know they have a world of uncertainty to struggle through -- & they also know whence comes all -- sufficient & only-sufficient help -- We have had letters lately from Rebecca Jones, &c. -- She was seeking rest, & to repair constitution, &c. at Chrissy Hustlers, when she wrote -- intended thence to York to see Thomas Ross, who (by accounts) rather declines as to the outward, though sound as to the inward man -- his latter end (which probably is not far off) will doubtless be Peace -- Esther Tuke (we understand) seems also declining in health -- her near connexions are I believe fearful about her -- The female boarding-school at York thrives (I hear) -- Nelly Abraham, a valuable, sweet-spirited woman presides -- I learn that Patience Brayton accompanied by Phebe Blakes (formerly Marshall), & Mehetabel Jenkins accompanied by Molly Davis are gone to the Northern parts of Yorkshire, &c -- that John Pemberton was returned to Newcastle, engaged in visiting families -- Molly Davis writes to her sister Hannah in Waterford, (dated 6th instant) John Pemberton looks well through all his hardship & trials -- expressed in a select meeting that he was at a loss to know what line of service might next open to him -- but desired to stand open to the counsel of his friends, & claimed their sympathy -- he went from Leeds to York to see Thomas Ross, as did Mehetabel Jenkins & sister Molly. This paragraph Hannah Davis communicated to a friend in Waterford, who transcribed it for me, & I sent it to thee, knowing all your particular attachment there to that devoted servant J: P: -- I understand George Dillwyn is labouring in Cumberland -- his amiable wife quartering very agreeably with Sarah Irwin at Wigton -- William Matthews & Anna Jessop at London -- Rebecca Jones speaking of her country-folk, whom she met at Leeds, says, they all seemed cheerful, & content with their wages.
	I make no doubt but thou hast long ago heard that my daughter Peggy was safe of a Peggy 7th instant. She has mended finely -- her little one (a beautiful creature to be sure) extracts nutriment from her stoutly -- Sally (I apprehend) leaves her to day ^(27th)^ on her way towards Cork -- I suppose she will make some stay at her favourite Springmount -- though possibly she may be disappointed in her expectation of much of Samuel Neales company -- he may be called from domestick enjoyments, & ordered to do duty at a distance from home -- I suppose thou hears now & then from thy sisters -- I hear nothing but that they are well -- Last information we had concerning Zachariah Dicks was that he was better & took the air in J: Inmans carriage, I think -- Poor young Isaac I believe still remains considerably indisposed -- More ugly work (I hear) in that meeting -- which Fame will spread soon enough, loud enough & far enough -- Tell thy father our Quarterly Meeting is to be 10th, 11th & 12th proximo at Mountmelick -- & I send him a challenge to come to it. We are at present mercifully favoured with tolerable health -- my wife often ailing more or less -- but keeps on her legs, & gets mostly to the meetings which she belongs to. Abraham, our beloved Lydia, & their little flock finely -- business doing very well -- How is dear James Morton now? Remember us very warmly & affectionately to him, & to the hopeful youth of our acquaintance about him, when opportunity offers -- I have said nothing of dear Tommy Watson -- he is safe -- out of the reach of temptation -- I believe the change infinitely better for him -- & I hope his parents will bear the dispensation with proper submission to the divine will -- thy poor mother still holds out -- Robert Clibborn has been removed -- & the widow Nancy Barclay, by whose death her children ^daughters^ lose the advantage they had by her annuity of 130, I hear -- Farwell, my dear cousin -- Accept of all our dear love -- the same to thy father & all thine as if particularly named -- Remember me to my old fellow-traveller Aby -- Nanny MccConaughty got a fall climbing in the henhouse -- desire Molly MccLaughlin to take care of her self -- it would be sad if the props of our families should fail. Once more dearly farewell,
	Richard Shackleton.

P.S. Hannah Davis of Waterford is (we understand) lately safe of a daughter.
