Richmond 4th of 2nd. month 1828
My dearest Sarah
It was with very great concern that
I read thy letter bringing me the melancholy tidings
of Emily's disease being alas! such a fatal one. and
with surprise too - for although from a letter from Ballitore
I was prepared to hear of her heavy illness I had
no idea but that it [deletion]might be[/deletion] [insertion]was[/insertion] a relapse of fever
& thought that as our brother Richard had struggled through
his fearful one, that perhaps she might be able to get
through that - in fact I was not prepared for the truth
& it fell on my mind & memory of her in all her opening
graces, with an icy chill - to say I feel & sympathize
with her mother & sisters deeply - is not to say half what
I feel for them, nor half to express the grief I feel that
such a blossom should be thus untimely blasted. Dost
thou recollect Mrs Barbauld's beautiful thought on Death
I have thought of the first stanza almost incessantly
since I got thy sad letter
"When Life as opening buds is sweet
And golden hopes the spirit greet
And Youth prepares his joys to meet
Alas! how hard it is to die!"
I would send my dear love & deep sympathy to thy poor
mother & sisters, but that the approach of a person now
so unconnected with their thoughts might be to them an
intrusion it is enough for thee [insertion]& Edwd[/insertion] to know that I sincerely
feel what I express. How melancholy my last letter must
have been to thee! - Be careful not to allow Selina or Lucy to be

too much about Emily - particularly Selina as being younger
& her constitution not perhaps quite [unclear][/unclear] - take [unclear]warning[/unclear]
by the Leekey's whose consumption was thought to have
been conveyed from one to another owing to close attendance
I had a letter a few evenings ago from Eben telling
me hoped to be with us in about a week. I need
not tell thee that this gave me great pleasure. I do
not know whether Elizabeth is in Munster or not
if she should be in Clonmel & not come here
I shall think it very strange indeed, even for
Elizabeth. Anna Watson is come, so adieu.
5th. I have only time to bid thee farewell
and with dear love to thyself & Edward
to say I am most afftely thine
LJ Fisher
I shall be [unclear]hoping[/unclear] to hear from thee
again of Emily.
