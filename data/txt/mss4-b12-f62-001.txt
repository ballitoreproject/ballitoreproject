Dear Cousin
I send you the newest shape, that I could
get, and I believe one that will be much worn, but it
looks to much disadvantage made of this plait, it would
look much better, in du[insertion]n[/insertion]stable, or split, straw, I have just
finished it and write this in great haste, as the person
who takes it is waiting; the shape arrived here from
London only last week, and I am told straw will be very
much worn this summer - We clean leghorn, but did
not get the one Maria told us was sent to us.
I have but time to desire to be remembered to all friends
and remain yours MR.
