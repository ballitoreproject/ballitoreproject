Ballitore: 24th of 3rd month 1788

My dear friend

++ The vessels in the Lords house must be of a metal that is beaten and hammered that they may bear rough usage without being injured & becoming leaky - they must be firm & consolidated for frequent use ++
I am pleased you had so much comfort from SNs visit - religious characters are very extraordinary things - there is often a wonderful mixture in them. Supernatural qualifications in a superior degree, & natural ones in an inferior degree - and the reverse. Thus it is manifest from whence is the excellency of the power. I love that man and contemplate him with admiration - he is I believe a true minister of the Gospel.
