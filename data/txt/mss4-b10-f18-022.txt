On Board Norma
Sailing down Lough Long
July 26th 56
My dear Mamma
In the hopes that
I may get some post either
this Evening or to-morrow
Morning I just write a
line to say we are all
safe & well, & have seen
more this week than we
did in the same time
since we set out, but

we now give up expecting
any real summer weather
at all counts our faces
will soon be turned towards
home, & though we have
seen much that is beautiful
we will not regret, turning
to home, sweet home, the
vessel is going so topsyturvy
I can't write more at present
with dear love to all your
much attached MJB
P. S. direct as I told you
We expect to be soon at
Lamlash.
