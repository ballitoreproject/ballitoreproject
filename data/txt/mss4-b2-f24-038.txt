My dear Father,


        I am favoured with thy last kind letter, the various intelligence which it contained was mostly new to me, dear Sallys being better was particularly grateful, poor dear Mollys return I believe was what she desired, & would be an ease to her mine (I owe ^her^ 7s.: 0  now I think of it) Mary Ridgways affliction is great & deep, she is like Chosen in that Furnace, & I trust will hold her integrity fast to the end of Time, & arrive where a Mansion of everlasting repose is prepared for her, & all those who keep the faith unto the end. I think more & more our lives may well be compared to a fight, we have so many attacks from different quarters from our Grand Adversary, that we had need pray to be accoutred with the whole Armour of light, I find myself strongly attacked at times, & am at such seasons I may say sorely distressed, & but for the wonderful, gracious interposition of the Captain of our ^this^ [sic] warfare, what would become of us? when he appears armies of Aliens are put to flight: well thou heard of our sweet spirited friend E: Pims publick appearance amongst ^us^, openly bearing testimony she is not ashamed to won her Master, & advocate his Cause, according to the strength he gives: she spoke a few words to day: verily there is a reward for the righteous, verily he is a God that judges in the earth, without any comment after, I cannot feel much for others, only sympathy & good wishes at times, she seems much relieved in her spirit, & I believe is on the right foundation, of humble diffidence, & confidence in the putter forth of his own Sheep. Rebecca Joness remebra^n^ce is particularly cheering to my spirit, for I hold her very high in esteem, as a chosen Vessel, rightly prepared, & rightly steered in her movements, going steadily on according to the Captains good pleasure, oh that there were many more like her so clothed with humility & abasement of Self, so frugal of the Masters treasure, & yet so ready & willing to distribute at the Word of command; may she ^be^ preserved to the end [2 words crossed out] ^in this^ service, that so her crown may be weighty when the warfare is accomplished: if any of you should address her I would take the liberty to send a portion of the very best love I have. Last accounts from London still leave us uncertain as to the return of our Brother & sister there, they are both low I hear, perhaps there [sic] spirits oppressed in that City, of which I should not wonder, (for I believe if all the friends from other places that were at yearly meeting were out of it, that it would be an oppressive, dismal place, for the true born Son or daughter to draw breath in. I have just been interrupted by visitors, & dined since, my Husband had been in Waterford, & came home, I dont find there is any thing new amongst our friends there; it is pleasing to find my Mother gets her health pretty well, & that little Peggy Shackleton is recovering, our little Sally has been poorly, & does not look as well as usual yet, she has very little appetite compared to other children, takes conserve of Rhue, & also back [?] by Doctor Harriss directions. Our little Abraham seldom writes to us, but we hear he is well, which is a great favour.
        My Husband joins me in dear love to you all. I have scribbled a little just as it occurred, which is scarcely worth sending, & I cannot well enlarge, not having matter, or quiet either, if I had, as our children has Betsy Dudley visiting them, I want to settle them all, must therefore
        conclude thy dutiful & affectionate 
                Margaret Grubb
