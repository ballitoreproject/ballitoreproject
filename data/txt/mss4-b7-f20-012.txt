Dr Mrs. Leadbeater
It gave me great pleasure
to hear so favorable an account [insertion]of[/insertion] Owen's
Mother and her Children. - I have indeed
been amply recompensed by their
good conduct I am glad that Owen
is able to act the part of Monitor,
and I hope that he supports himself
by his services so as not to [unclear][/unclear]
[unclear][/unclear] his Mother, whom you mentioned
as having her Daughters still at home.
Anne I observe goes out as a sempstress,
by which means she no doubt
adds to their little Stock - For I wish
all young people to relieve as soon
as possible their aged parents -
I was very much concerned to find
your School had received any shock
by the priest, or any other Roman
Catholic, any thing like Warfare
in plans of Education, so to be

worded, and particularly between
Protestants and Papists, as only mutual
good will can at all heal
the wounds of poor Ireland, and
accelerate that blessed Day -
When with reverence shall each hostile land
Hear & obey that high command.
Thy Son's blest errand from above
Thy Creatures dwell in mutual love
Lancaster has sadly lost himself in
our part of the World, and I am
much concerned at it, but he
wanted as you justly observe, the
ballast of humility. - He has however
as well as Dr: Bell [insertion]been[/insertion] the means of
great & wide spread Good to many
an ignorant creature.-
I am much pleased with the
exertions of your children in the
cause of benevolence: it is bringing
them up to great usefulness,

and to tread in your own steps.
I have enclosed a pound note
to be applied to either of the benevolent
[unclear]prorposes[/unclear] you mention
or to be divided between both -
but I rather incline to throw my
mite into the fund for the aged
& infirm - female poor - who in
Ireland are peculiarly pitiable
as there is no poor rate to assist
their wants. - Lady Emily Latouche,
whom you mention is a great
blessing to your country. -
I am very glad that Mr: Whites
School is so prosperous as to have
sixty boarders. - The loss of an [unclear]xsher[/unclear]
of the description you give, was
indeed a heavy loss to the Seminary -
I am sorry you thought
it necessary to make an apology
for giving me the interesting details

your letter contains - believe
me they were quite acceptable -
and sincerely wishing you success
in all your Plans
:- I am truly & sincerely Yours
Francis [underline]Smith[/underline]
