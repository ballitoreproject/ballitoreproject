My dear Madam
Miss Leadbeater
was out when I called
upon her today, I will
therefore be obliged to
you to try your influence
to bring her to Buckm.
St. as it may be quite
out of my power to

see her sufficiently soon,
& I would feel, even if I did,
a little awkwardness in
inviting her to our house
As I know that it is difficult
for you to leave
your house, perhaps you
would send her a line,
stating my mothers wish
to see her either tomorrow
evening, or the evening following,
in Buckingham St.
& pleading a cold which
prevents my Mothers going
out of doors, as an excuse
for her not waiting [insertion]on[/insertion] her.
you will be good enough
to mention that you w[unclear][/unclear]
matronize her, as you
promised to me to d[unclear][/unclear]
If you find this at all
inconvenient to you I
hope you will not give
yourself any trouble about
it - And you can let me know

tomorrow when I call at your
house to accompany you to
see the Swiss Views, at 1/2 past 2
Yrs very affectionately J.Henry
