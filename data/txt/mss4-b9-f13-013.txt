Richmond 27th.. of 4th month 1824
My dearest Sarah
This very morning I had resolved
on beginning a letter to thee, & was thinking again of it
& of doing it when I would have put Joseph to sleep, when
thy very welcome letter was handed to me - really a
[underline]letter[/underline] & no dainty scrap half tantalizing. - I was both
glad & surprised to hear Elizth was as the meeting
I did not think from a letter of hers to my mother
that she would have gone - her company must be
peculiarly acceptable to thee now. I need not tell
thee how grieved I was to hear of your loss - I felt amazed
& stunned, & for days & nights I could not help
doubting & wondering - most sincerely do I sympathize
with you - but thy mother I was not surprised at
her composure nor her patience of resignation but
it is not the tear at the moment shed - She will long
feel his loss most bitterly. - Thy mention of the
family was very interesting to me, it is long since
I heard so much of them or was brought so among
you & if thou had said more [insertion]of[/insertion] Margaret I would have
been quite satisfied - no, thou only refers me to
C- Grattan - I can not treat thee it, so expect a
most minute description of thy nephew.
4th of 5th month I have allowed this to remain long unfinished
but I have such constant going out & when in, nursing
white in sweetness & sense [unclear]Mark[/unclear] surpasses her in beauty
& talent - My late letters to thee were filled with our
plans about moving - my father would not permit it &
we are entirely fixed here - as far as we can see - & most happy
I am it is so settled for I think the advantage of living in
the country & the privilege of living with such a father &
such a sister cannot be prized too highly. - but James & I
thought we could not bring another servant & all the trouble
of an infant into a house where there was such a burden already.
as my poor Grandmother - however we were so cordially
forced to stay & the mention of our Jessy seemed to give
such pain - that we joyfully receeded - & the child is so
quiet & such a favourite that it would be a sin to separate
him from his Grandfather - & how he is growing every
day more playful & is gayer with him than with any
body. - It is an affecting sight to see the infant laid on a
table for [deletion]my[/deletion] [insertion]his great[/insertion] Grandmother to hold him with her one arm
the only one she can move - to see her smiling on him &
uttering her only sounds "Oh! nanny nanny" in a delighted
voice, while he smiles & talks in his language to her

that I have very little time. My kind people not been
satisfied except I am jaunting or walking or eating - I
am sure if I could swallow all I am ordered nursing
would soon make me fat - Joseph is growing very
large & heavy, & will not rest a moment: lying down
or sitting still - he chooses to be constantly dandled
his shoulders & chest are broad - his limbs tolerably
shapely - his feet small - his head large & rather long
scarcely a morsel of hair on it, his forehead large
his eyes are large & very dark blue with very long eyelashes
curled up at the end - his nose is - [underline]ugly[/underline]
with broad nostrils - his mouth & chin pretty with
a dimple in the left cheek - he prefers sitting
perfectly erect - Today he is 6 weeks old - he
has been taking so little notice this week past
talks & smiles & sometimes laughs - but he is rather
a sober little blade - particularly with his Grandfather
who nurses him a great deal - as soon as
Grand-father takes him he puts on a sober solid
countenance - generally crosses his hands & looks
as if he was in meeting - my father does all he
can to divert [insertion]him[/insertion] but mostly in vain - though he
never cries with him. I forgot to mention his fingers
& his hands which are formed exactly like James's
& which is the only resemblance I can trace between
him & his father. his skin is mottled & he
looks very healthy. My Grandmother doats on him
She verging towards the grave & life only opening for him.
he never cries with her thus, & seems to like her countenance -
one - if she hears him cry she sends her nurse to
know why & is uneasy until she hears I have him.
We have at present on a visit & looking out for a situation
as housekeeper, a most agreeable clever young woman Sally
Greer - a northerner - she lived with my father from the
time of my aunt Jane's marriage until she returned
[insertion]a[/insertion] widow with her two children & lived with my uncle James & Mary [insertion]until after Mary's death -[/insertion]
I hope my next letter will bring thee some account of
the yarn for Margaret's stockings. - I have not seen E Gratton
yet - but intend visiting her the next day I go into town.
I was grieved to hear of poor Henrys death. "Beyond the
Western wave" he has indeed found his home. - We read
nothing - have not even read Rock's memoirs - nor can
not even get it to buy - but I hope we soon will.
What are you doing in that way - I hope thou wert
not overdone with the meeting - I hope thou can decypher
can he feel that it is a most sweet benevolent

He sleeps very well & never disturbs me more than twice
in the night - his bed is settled close to mine & I can
see him from my own pillow - he is a great feeder
& though I have plenty for him, the saucepan [unclear]shows[/unclear]
largely with me in rearing him. His [underline]maid[/underline] is a
widow who has one child, a little girl living near this,
She is a steady agreeable woman - & very knowing about
children - She lived, before she married, with my aunt
Harvey - & left her when Mary married to live with her.
She is quiet & I believe very goodtempered from her
face. Her name is Kelly. & what can I say more?
We have very agreeable accounts from Thos his prospects
seem dearing, & he is very sanguine himself - he has
met with a great many friends in London - but no
pupil as yet - His terms we
think too high & monstrous high.
but he is recommended by his
London friends & they should know best - they [unclear][/unclear]

12th My father & aunt Jane & her children set off this
morning for Ballitore - hastened one week, by a letter
from George saying Hannah was ill - we are of course
extremely anxious I have left thee a long time
dear Sarah with thy letter unanswered & I am afraid
thou & Edward will think I am grown a sorry girl.
We had letters from Eben & D: about a week past
& very refreshing they were. I am longing to see little

this. - I intend to write very shortly to Eliza - It must
be a comfort to have thy father buried where his grave
can be known & visited & not laid in that chilling
[unclear]Park[/unclear] street - [unclear]I head[/unclear] Jane's song in Crabbe's tale of the
sisters, it expresses all that we feel in those cruel grave yards
To have the body buried in a city which once contained a spirit
that gloried in the beauties of nature - this is nothing in
reality - but it is all to the hearts of the [unclear]mourners[/unclear]. A letter
this moment from Ballitore brings us the delightful
news of poor Hannah & her daughter. -
I must say farewell dearest Sarah
ever thy affte. LJFisher
My dear love to
Edward & to Elizth. if still
with thee. & James's also as well as to his dear Sister & Niece
Remember me most afftly. to thy mother & all of
you.

not by neglect but business - you
must forgive us dear Sal - goodbye!

form many conjectures about thy meeting us there - Can
it be? for I know so little about thee - however meet
somewhere I hope we will this year - Oh if I could see
you here! & surely you might come so far. When you
visited England last year - one day's journey would
give us all more exquisite pleasure than a month's
rambling through the loveliest scenery - at least so
I think - as soon as our [insertion]quarterly[/insertion] meeting is over I hope Sally
will go to Ballitore - & when she returns I expect to bring
my [underline]Phoenix[/underline] to see you all - but I will not willingly
go any where till Sally gets some recreation & amusement
She sends her love to thee & thou would love her for
I never saw a sweeter creature - She equals Hannah

something about a
mill in Limerick it
would be delightful
indeed to me - but
thou & Ballitore would
suffer deeply if they
came here - Oh! that
we could be nearer
each other - but we
are too deeply blessed
to murmur at even
separation. We got

& what we have had
delighted us.
I think I never shewed
thee a little poem Sally
wrote on thy [unclear][/unclear]: I will

how she never wrote a
line in Joseph (or Bepp
as his father calls him)
& yet she fairly adores
him, & is almost angry when people say
he is not handsome, neither is he
but he is fine fat & healthy & that
is better Forgive me for not
