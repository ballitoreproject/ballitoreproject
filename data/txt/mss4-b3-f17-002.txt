My dear friend


        On reading over thy letter at this time and observing the date of it I find myself even more culpable than I thought, I cannot plead my cause so well as thou did thine, I have ever been averse from certain periods for this kind of converse because the heart has seldom any share in it the occasion of the delay was (though in idea thou were often present) the intervention of various occurrences which so wholly engrossed my time that I could not devote any part of it to writing without inconvenience
        Our Eliza is now at Newington with our good friends the Hoares, she means to spend the week there, the loss of so near a friend as her Nancy was, was a sore stroke to her, but I hope she has been favoured with strength to prevent its injurious progressWe hear with heart felt satisfaction of the happy prospects from your new attainee; my spirit breathes an earnest wish that the dawn may be the presage of a glorious day Report says that my dear Debby is soon to be a Wife; how is it? I am so interested in her happiness that I am anxious to know your result if I had had any suspicion that Jo Sparrow wished to be united to your family I should have taken more particular notice of him that I might at least have drawn the outlines of his Character I can only remember him as one would a shadow which passed & vanished No doubt you are informed of Samuel Neale and Jo: Garratts [sic] progress; Samuel (if I may use an expression fo Shakespears [sic] on such a subject) out does his usual out doings, every class of the people are pleased with his Ministry, indeed I beleive [sic] their eagar eagerness has been a great burden to him. dont [sic] thou think him a wonderful instrument? the gift of Grace is so great in him that when simple nature shews itself it appears weak and feeblesince their coming I spent near a week with Alice Chorley, the very recollection of it is pleasing to me; such a feast as her conversation is rare to meet with, I beleive [sic] I may venture to assert that she has not lost ground since thou saw her
        Elizabeth Gibson and Elizabeth Evans are not on a visit to the City, the latter I very much admire, she seems to give what she has to communicate in all its native purity; the humble simplicity that marks her deportment is highly pleasing
        Last week we had a striking proof that even the rigours of health will ^not^ insure our residence in these bodies of Clay, at nine o Clock at night as my father walked in Holborn he was thrown down by the pole of a Coach directly across the horses under their feet his leg and arm were cut and very much bruised, but happily no internal injury appears and the wounds heal kindly, if the Coachman had drove on, there was scarcely a chance of his life being savedwe wish my sister Grubb not to hear of it; for one cannot help being deeply affected at such an accidentbut particular^l^y when so near a connection is the subject of it; he has not staid one day at home on account of it, but goes on as usual only keeping his leg up while he sits.
        My poor Mother continues to sustain the various shocks [word obscured by seal] flesh is heir to with an uncommon degree of fortitude [word obscured by seal] I trust her health is not materially worse; she joins me in every sentiment of serious regard for thee thy wife & Children Betsy too charged me with her dearest remembrance of you 
We sometimes participate your satisfaction in these your peaceful enjoyments.My heart is too fraught with gratitude for thy indulging me with this intercourse
        Farewell!Hannah Pim
