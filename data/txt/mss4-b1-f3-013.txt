	Dear Children,
		When I hear of the unfair walking of several under the profession of truth, (the very truth of God; a truth that will stand the test, through all generations, to the end of time,) I am concerned for you, my dear children, that you may fully answer the end of your creation, by glorifying the Great Author thereof, and be lights to others, that they may safely tread in your steps, who are concerned to follow the self-denying Jesus, who bade his disciples to take up their daily cross, and follow him in the strait and narrow way that leads to happiness. Thus your words will be few, and convey something profitable to your school-fellows. My ardent desire for your lasting welfare, not only your reputation amongst men, which is to be regarded, but that you may grow in favour with the Most High, whose presence fills heaven and earth, from whom nothing is hid, makes me think of the beloved disciple: ‘I have no greater joy, than to hear that they children walk in the truth’	
									A.S.
