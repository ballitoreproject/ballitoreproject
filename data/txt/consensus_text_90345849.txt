16 Thursday - Polly and I spent
this day very much to ourselves -
Papa and the Mistress drove round
in the morning but Papa only staid
a few minutes being in haste to
catch the train - Thomas returned
at about 6 O'clock and soon
afterwards Papa called for me and
prevailed upon Polly and Thomas
to come up to tea also - It was very
pleasant to have them here -
17 Friday - Staid in bed until 12 O'clock
for my back's sake - Oh I wish I was
well This was a most delightful
day - Had a letter from Louisa Grubb,
the first since her father's death -
18th Saturday. Papa staid out here today, Lydia went
to town with MFW, and has just come out. Spent
a pleasant afternoon with Miss Stuart, spent
most of the day on the stretcher in lawn endeavoring
to stretch the pain out of my back. Philip
appeared after tea and remains here tonight having
brought a letter from E Cole to me. Ned also has
returned to the family nest. Charlie is still away
