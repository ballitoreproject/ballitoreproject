My dear Elizabeth
As Sarah is in the
country, and as I was very anxious
to hear from her Abby Wright was, I opened
your note received this day in which
you say Nancy Doyle desires to
be informed by post how my Uncle
Wright is. She is I suppose aware that
[unclear]he got[/unclear] a relapse whilst out at S. Doyle's
at Pelier and was obliged again
to call in the Dr. He is better to day
they state but is very weak and extremely
low spirited, but I hope his disorder
tho' tedious is unattended with danger.
Sarah and the children are well
as one could wish. I hope the lemons
were in time, I could get but two
to send off the evening I came home
but Sarah forwarded four the next
night, does Mr D [unclear]/unclear] for any more
or anything else that I could forward

for her? my Love to all Post office
& [unclear]Moore[/unclear] particularly my father
and believe me yours
affectionately
Edw Barrington
we should be very glad
to hear how A Wright gets on
I forgot to pay 8d postage to you and 6d advanced
for me by my father to coach agent, credit me for
a while
Elizabeth Leadbeater
