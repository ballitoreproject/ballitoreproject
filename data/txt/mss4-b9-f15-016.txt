Crieff 7th of 8th Month 1821. -
Thomas Fisher to Sarah Leadbeater
I received thy welcome frank-ful of letter-shreds very unexpectedly on 7th
day evening - it occasioned a very agreeable interruption to the very troublesome
& most disagreeable business of packing up - "Little" thought I to
myself as I read over the letter. "Little did my worthy friend Sarah think
when she was penning this, that I would receive it while preparing for a journey
before the termination of which I hoped to see [underline]herself[/underline] face to face." - But
[deletion]whl[/deletion] while these thoughts were running through my head, I never thought of
answering the letter - "there's no occasion to answer it, -" thought I - "I shall
soon see herself, & one hours [deletion]verbal[/deletion] oral talk together will be pleasanter to
us both than all the letters I could write - besides I'm too busy to be [underline]bother'd[/underline]
writing to Sarah now." So stood thy chance of getting a reply to thy letter, until
to-day, after a journey of 22 miles, half on-coach, half-on foot & seated in a
[deletion]comfortable[/deletion] [insertion]snug little[/insertion] room, in a good inn, with a kind,[underline] winsome[/underline] gay landlady,- after a
comfortable dinner,- a thought suddenly struck me- "Perhaps Sarah would like to
have a written account of my high-land travels, although I should be myself
the bearer of it" - so no sooner did my landlady [insertion]happen to[/insertion] enter the room for I had
attempted to ring the bell without- success & I felt too lazy to go to the Door & call -
no sooner, I say, did she happen to enter, than I [unclear][/unclear] away the remains of my
dinner & requested pen ink & paper - by the instrumentality of which, I have written
thus far. - But this thou wilt say is taking a jump, & a jump of which I
cannot know the extent, for where is Crieff, from whence the letter is dated - I [deletion]dont[/deletion] [insertion]dinna[/insertion]
see the falls of Moness, near Aberfeldie, which certainly were very beautiful, - at least the woody glen was very beautiful,
for falls where were scarcely any;- I have been very unfortunate with respect to waterfalls
this tour, almost all that I have seen have been half-dried up.- I hope Joss Abell will
have better luck this year - I took a short walk of 6 1/2 miles,- along the southern bank
of the Tay through a fine wooded-Lily country,- & am now at Kinmen a beautiful little
village situated on Loch Tay.- Just before dinner I went to see Taymouth Castle, the
modern mansion of the Earl of Briardalburn - & there I saw paintings & costly furniture
& all the frippery of nobility - I discovered his Lordship to be a Whig [deletion]however[/deletion] by seeing a parcel
of Morning Chronicles lying on one of the tables.- The Marquis of Buckingham & his son Lord
Temple are expected at the Castle to-morrow; I saw the beds they are to sleep in. the Marquis
sleeps in the same bed which Prince Leopold did when he was th[deletion]rere[/deletion][insertion]ere[/insertion] but enough of this morning.
I am now come among the lakes - & these I think will form the most interesting part of
my tour, particularly Loch Katrine, which I expect to see on third day next - this is sixth
day.-
11.- I had a very pleasant walk to day. - I think the most agreeable which I have had yet, of
16 miles, along Loch Tay from [unclear]Kenmore[/unclear] to Killin- Ben-mire, a conical mountain [deletion]at[/deletion] with
the sun shining upon it appeared in view a great part of the walk & was particularly beautiful.
This is sacrament time at Killin.- I overtook a little boy on the way here who ran
to me. "You'll [underline][unclear]bide[/unclear][/underline] the sacrament to-morrow" - "No; I think not" said I.

ken if its nigher to Johnny Groat's [underline]house[/underline], or Gretna Green;" - well then, to fill up the
gap caused by this jump & to satisfy thy natural curiosity to fathom the void betwixt.-
I inform thee that I left Edinburgh, yesterday [deletion]morning[/deletion] f[deletion]ore[/deletion][insertion]ore[/insertion] noon about
11. - & walked down to Newhaven, with my friend Gibson, & one Mr. Finch, a
boarder at Mrs. Gillies's. - & took a seat in the steam-boat. "[unclear]Altra Stai[/unclear]" for Stirling -
I shud not however enlarge much on the journey either of yesterday or to-day, lest
I should not have space sufficient for what is to come, which I hope will form
the most interesting part of [deletion]it[/deletion] [insertion]my tour[/insertion] - Suffice it then to say that I had a very pleasant
trip to Stirling, - admired, as I went [insertion]along[/insertion], both banks of the Forth,- particularly the [unclear]behile[/unclear]
hills in the northern bank (which are in the neighbourhood of Stirling) - wondered at
the strange contortions of the river, which at one time placed the [unclear]behile[/unclear] hills gilded
most beautifully with the softening radiance of the declining sun, full in my right,
& at another behind my back - but I am falling into the fault which I wished
to avoid. - when I got to an inn at Stirling,- I engaged a bed in room No 27 & then
left my knapsack - & went off to Stirling Castle which commands a most beautiful
& extensive view - a great part of which however I was obliged to fill up with my imagination, -
the son of Benjamin, which I most wished to see - I mean, Ben-lomond. -
Ben-ledi - Ben-venue & Ben-vorlich - were shrouded in thick clouds as black
as Erebus & "old night" - I dont know whether this is a quotation or not, although I
have marked it as such for fear of being called a plagiarist - but no matter it will do as
well whether it is a quotation or not - I was rather disappointed by the clouds; so I took
a walk round "the lady's walk" - & having walked home, walked to bed.- Next morning the
sun shone most delightfully. I got up between 6 & 7 - & went out, as I thought to see the
[underline]Bens[/underline] - but the Bens were still hidden - the morning, however being so fine I went round
the lady's walk in another direction, talked to a man I met there about Bannockburn
& the King's visit to Ireland - he wanted to know if I was travelling for my health? No, I
said, it was to see the country "Are ye from Edinbro' " - "No! I'm from Ireland" - & from that an
12. - Left Killin at 10 o'clock, - a fine, warm, calm quiet [underline]sabboth[/underline] morning. - For 2 or 3 miles along
the road, I met cart-loads of the country-folks,- drest in their [deletion][/deletion] [underline]bran new claes[/underline] coming to
the sacrament, & staring down at me, [deletion]apparently[/deletion] with a sour-looking frown which seemed to me
to say "Ha! you atheist! - turning your back on the holy ordinance" - Perhaps, however, I am
doing the worthy folks injustice, for such of them as I asked respecting the road to Loch-earn-head
answered me very civilly.- About three miles from Killin, I came into a wild valley called Glen Ogle,
through which I scarcely met a human being, except 2 men, as wild looking as the rough hills themselves,
[deletion]with an[/deletion] one of whom had an [unclear]immature[/unclear] red beard & asked me for a bit of tobacco.- I
am now at Loch-earn-hurd about 1 o'clock & as soon as I have dined, I intend taking a walk
along the Lake (Loch Earne) & return to tea.-
15.- Belloch. I have seen a [underline]sight[/underline] of things since I last put pen to paper
to converse with thee - but I must proceed in regular order. - Well then, last first-day
evening, I took a walk, as I had intended, for a mile or two along Loch Earne, which walk
I enjoyed very much, it being a most beautiful evening; - but the following morning was
quite wet - & I had 14 miles to walk to Callender however, I proceeded, under
great discouragements, though Strathire to Loch Lubnaig, or as the people there call
it, Loch Ludnaig, - shortly after the first appearance of which, the sun began to

passed most naturally to the King's visit - but I must stop now - as I intended not
to have his paper in this page - but I'll continue as I go on,- or go on as I continue.
8th This day I am at [deletion]Dunkild[/deletion], [insertion]I never, near Dunkeld[/insertion], a very beautiful place; having passed to-day
"through a wild mountain road of 20 miles to Dunkeld" - as John Richman very truly
calls it - in the [deletion][/deletion] plan of my tour which he was so kind as to write out for me.
But to go back to Stirling.- I left Stirling yesterday morning in the coach about
11 o'clock & went [deletion]on it[/deletion] about [unclear]11[/unclear] miles to Greenloaning where I got off & walked
on to Crieff, [deletion]after[/deletion] [insertion]stopping on my way to[/insertion] look[deletion]ing[/deletion] at the remains of a Roman camp at Ardoch & at the
grounds belonging to Drummond - castle.- & from Crieff I [unclear]came on[/unclear] here to-day, the
day has been very wet & dismal, that is the first part of it, but as I approached
Dunkeld, it brightened up. & now it is beautiful - I have drunk too much ale
at dinner to-day, so for fear of writing nonsense, I must stop here.
9.- I had the prudence to order a [underline]small beer[/underline] for my dinner to-day, in
consequence of which I feel my head somewhat clearer than it was this time
yesterday.- I came to-day 11 miles along the river Tay - through a tolerably
fine country but nothing remarkable - it is a blowing, showery dismal day, &
I am snugly settled at an inn in Wemyss,- with a [underline]roasting[/underline] fire - but how
I shall proceed with my pedestrian tour I know not, for I have blistered both
my heels.- I walked with one foot slip-shod for 12 miles to-day, which
wearied the said foot exceedingly, so much so that it was seized with the
cramp several times, & I was obliged to sit down by the road side &
rest it.-
10- This has been a beautiful day, & I have got on most delightfully,
much better than I ever expected.- with both [underline]heels up[/underline] - & neither much
worse for the wear.- After breakfasting at Wemyss this morning, I went to
break out, & during my walk along the lake (about 5 miles) the weather was pretty
fine, save that the [insertion]summits of[/insertion] surrounding hills were wrapped in thick mists [insertion]among the rest[/insertion] Ben Ledi who
lifted his towering front on the opposite side of the lake - but, as soon as I had passed the
lake, the fine weather disappeared with it, & down came the rain again in torrents.-
however, on I went, determined to take the weather as it came & [deletion][/deletion] at length arrived
to my great satisfaction at Callendar - Having stopped at the inn, I ordered
dinner & enquired of the waiter whether Dr. Moncrieff was in Callendar & where he lodged,
& after dinner, went to his lodgings from whence I was directed to go along the river
to visit him, which I did, & found him returning from fishing. - He was so kind as to
offer to call on me at the inn as soon as he had dined, & accompany me to "Bracklinn's
thundering waves" the Lady of the Lakes - which he did & returning from that we got a fine
show[deletion]wer[/deletion][insertion]er;[/insertion] he kindly took me to his uncles to tea, & he (the uncle) invited me to breakfast
the next morning.- Immediately after breakfast I set off for the classical
Loch Katrine, [deletion]tho[/deletion] by [unclear]Corlantogh ford[/unclear], Lendrick Mead, & along Loch Vennachar
& Achray - but I have unfortunately filled my paper so that I cannot give
thee an account of this delightful day.- However, we shall soon meet I hope,
& I will tell thee all about it.
Farewell for the present -

Sarah Leadbeater -
