love them to the end. So I hope thy dear mother, my precious helpmate,
will not be suffered to sink below measure; but rely on, and feel
underneath, the everlasting arm of sure help. You will, I doubt not
continue to take all necessary, assiduous, affectionate care of her:
and her prospect, whether she looks backward or forward, as to her
self, seems, in my estimation, bright and clear; so to all-wise and
all-merciful Providence I commit and commend you all

xxx It is very pleasing intelligence, that thy mother is
as well as usual. I hope she has by this time, got her children with, and
about her; and that they, with the hope of the next generation after you,
her grandchildren comfort and cherish her. I was uneasy at not hearing
from some of you; but a little matter lays my storm pulveris exigui
jactu. I continue, thank Providence, in good health; visiting my
friends, chatting with Margaret, and pondering at times about my own
state, and the state of others. [deletion]xx[/deletion] Providence best knows what
is best for us. He knows how to proportion what is called good and
evil in this life, so as that the aggregate may be most to our advantage
