Cork 5th of 3d month 1796.
My dear Friend,
Thy kind, honest letter of the 1st did not reach me
till yesterday, when the Dublin post went not from hence, but I take the earliest opportunity
of making reply - Thou knowest, I expect, that I wish not to appear much in
possession, or to say a deal about these things, & I hope thou will knowest it to be
grateful to me, my being considered & asked to as a [underline]family friend[/underline] - [unclear]My W L shall[/unclear]
I intend, be accommodated with the sum thou mentions & in the way proposed
Perhaps it would not make any material difference to him whether it be remitted
immediately or taken a few weeks hence, when we may possibly see each other, but
if it does, I request thy fairly telling me so . - -
I had heard of Hannah Duckett's removal prior to they information: it was
hardly to be expected her being taken before her ancient, infirm husband.
When the pen was in thy hand, why dids't thou not further gratify me from
VB's animated communication? - thou art kind in sharing so far, & it is acceptable
Mrs. Scattingood & John Abbott have been with us since last thirday; when
they are likely to move your way is uncertain - They have not yet as publickly opened
commissions here. Their lodging is at Jno. Morris's, his wife & son are pretty well,
as are friends generally in this City - P. Haughton's wife is recovering from a low
fever. You probably know more of N. Crotch & A. Jacob's [insertion]present[/insertion] movements than [insertion]we[/insertion] do.
I seem to have little to say for myself or others, but I [unclear]mainly[/unclear] salute you there, & hope
I can in sincerity subscribe myself Thy affectionate friend
James Abell
