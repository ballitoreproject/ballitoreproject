It is almost time to reply to my dear sister's last
acceptable letter, I put it of till my return from York, which
was not a very pleasant [insertion]journey[/insertion] my face was exceeding bad & seeing
so many strangers was rather mortifying, I often desired it might
be profitable, it was indeed a very large assembly, we
compute there was at least thirty publick friends 12 from
distant meetings, the night we went into town friend Berbeck
look into cousin Hammons they were likely to have a deal
of lodgers Willaim Jukes daughter was there she told me they
had half a bed for me I accepted of her offer & and had Alice-Rigg
for my bedfellow she was very affection to me enquired very
kindly after all our family sent her dear love & to my brother
in particular, said she had a vast love for him Ailce Ruth
seemed very glad to see me enquired very kindly after our
family & Elizabeth Haughton of Mullimast: John Eliot was
there I admire him much he had a very sweet countenance
I believe he is a very humble man & has the adorning of a meek
& quiet spirit, he I think said he had expected my father at the yearly
meeting this year enquired particularly how my brother was: he did,
not appear at all in the public meeting, nor Samuel Spavall
till the last when he did in a sweet manner & was so affected he
could scarce get on; he seems in a very good state of health a
chearful man he is Isaac Sharpless was there an ancient
friend I believe he was a good while ago in Ireland, fourth day
the meeting began at nine a clock for worship I think we went
after dinner about two to the womens meeting which was adjourned
as well as I can remember till nine next day about three in the

the afternoon when the parting meeting was held, till very late
& a crowded meeting it was a six day morning we left York came
to a town called Tadcaster where a barn was fited out for a
meeting & in very good order it was a gallery reared up for the
publick friends of whom there were several, it was very far
superior to the meeting house of Athy Ruth Fallows appeared
very beautifully mentioned her fear of forfeiting her inheritance
that if she had dared to be silent she should not have stood
up & much more she delivered in a very beautiful manner, after
the meeting a very large number dined at the inn & after dinner
parted we lodged that night at John Husler who is Married
to Benjamin Herd's sister Bridsy whom I often heard my father
speak of she seems a very fine woman, sent, her love to
my father they have a fine family of children; there I saw
a second cousin of mine her name Carbut( I think,) she seems
a good deal distressed about one of her sisters who is married
to a worthless man. Patience Webster nor Willy Shackleton
were neither [insertion]at York[/insertion][deletion][/deletion] they latter's wife was & they former's daughter
I should have been glad to have seen cousin Patience but as
Molly Bradford was so kind to go with me I could not stay
behind her, & it was not practicable at the meeting time I was
not very much taken with the daughter, I got her to go with me
to see cousin Jenny Todd's daughter she had not long lain
in had visitors with her, was dressed in white & seemed a very
handsome woman, her father I think is a good like mind
was at his shop with Molly Bradford & another young woman
he has a grand shop, I should not forget to tell thee that I think
cousin Richard Pike has got a very agreeable wife he is both
a complaisant husband & fond father I hastened from them
pretty soon. Hannah Pike had misearned & they wanted me to

to sit with her as [unclear][/unclear] about moving they are
true friends indeed I n[unclear][/unclear] afraid that accident would
have happened Hannah a [unclear]shipboard[/unclear] but through great favour she
got well home first, I did not I believe suffer a shipboard, had a
very good bed & when the sickness did not prevent rested & slept
well. I was glad to hear my dear sister felt so much comfort, thy
hear I trust is like the good ground, Esther has a fine family, she is
step mother to the elder children has two of her own who bear a very
strong resemblance of her, the younger was much taken with a frd
who was at the meeting called her mammy & I believe took her
for her mother. Cousin Mary Pim I often think of, should be
glad to be with her I send a receipt Lydia Dilworth gave me, but
as she has a surgeon attending her it is not likely she will try that
I left thy letter at Whitehaven so know not what I should reply
to Tom Wray's going back is not a very pleasing circumstance, his
manner in that particular thou mentioned is very disagreeable Jack
I suppose is gone a good riddance of him. I have thought a deal of
since I received my mother's letter, & long to hear of they boys
amendment. I expect soon to return to Whitehaven, I fear they
will not be for my returning very soon as I have been a good
deal from them. I fear thou canst scarce read this, I have wrote
it in a hurry. I wrote to Cousin Thomas Chandlee lately, wonder
I have received no answer, I suppose Tommy has got well
home before this & has entertained you with news, he is not such
a stupid traveller as I am, I to saw fine sights in Yorkshire
a very fine country it is, had my sister Molly been in my
place she might have transmitted some thing valuable to future
generations perhaps: I was in the house that Cousin David Hall
lived I saw several of cousin E Dale's Children there are two
in this town, one in this house a pretty sort of a girl. How is Nancy
Jackson a letter from her would be doubley acceptable now.

Has Mary Ridgeway yet returned Robert Dudely was hasty in his return home, I hoped
much I should have seen him at York but it proved like the hope of the hypocrite bash
Have you heard lately from Tannersend. My paper will not allow me to enlarge much
more My love & duty I beg thou my distribute as due. My old friend Molly Hudson I
remember with gratitude. I am thy very affectionate sister
