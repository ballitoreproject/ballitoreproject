I have a very sufficient excuse to make my
dear Molly for not writing to her before now which is
my being very unwell the first opportunity that offered
and the week Molly Fletcher went was our washing
that I cou'd not spare time I think I am to sincere
to profess a friendship where their is none friendship
have I said yea I have but I am affraid I am not capable
of true friendship I will say love for I have sincere Love
for thee & every of your Family I think I wou'd be
very ungreatful if I had not after all the favours I receiv'd
from them I was sorry to see thy dear Sisters Face so bad
I hope it is better before now - Thou does not say whether
Deborah Hautow writes to thee now I am thinking
Sally will not continue to write so often to thee such
sudden alternations seldom lasts long do let me know
whether thou mistrust her Father helps her to indite
it was she my corrospondent I wou'd ask her did he
I am glad Hannah Hauton is not [unclear]affeunted[/unclear] &
will not forget to give my love to her how is her [unclear]Ma[/unclear]
Let me know in thy next

How does thy worthy Mother [insertion]& Aunt[/insertion] gets their health now
and whether thy Aunts head does be so bad as it used to be
when we were at thy Fathers is thy Sister Sally's Eyes any
better than they ware some time ago I understand that Molly
Fletcher is to get no ressidence at thy Fathers I wish her
well but I believe she never will stay long in one place
she cryed very much at leaving this tho at the same time
reckined it was her own choice
viewing it and it has rased some serious thoughts in [unclear][/unclear]
it is just disappeared I think it is a beautiful sight I
thought it woud be well for me if I [deletion]was[/deletion] fit to dye or
if I had made a good use of my time to be ready for to look
pale death in the face as we have no sertainty of one
minuet in this World but this is not my happy state for
I believe few are worse than I am that has such a good [unclear]example[/unclear]
as I have it is all my own fault I cannot say as some
can my Mother or my eldist Sister does so and so and why
may not I that is younger to be sure that is but a thoughtless
saying it is but a poor excuse to make it will
not be a sufficient excuse for any of us but I will [unclear]alone[/unclear]
[unclear]e[/unclear]xample is very prevalent
It is now allmost sunset I have been

I have left the Company in the Parlor to finish
this scrawl amongst whome is the agreeable Anne Jackson
& her Father but thou may think I often see her and perhaps
say it was uwillingly I left them but I believe my dear
Molly when I say it was not for it gives [unclear][/unclear] at [unclear][/unclear]sure
to write to one that I have such a regard for as I have for
thee I have very little hopes of seeing thee soon as I
am not likely to go to the Meeting of Carlow does not one
of thy Elder Sisters intend coming this side soon - I like[unclear][/unclear]
