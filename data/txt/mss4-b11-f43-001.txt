Dear Margaret - Dont be afraid. I have
[unclear]torn[/unclear]up the contract. Nobody but Hill
ever saw it. I never had any thought of
printing it. Thy correspondent is an
able woman - but is not willing that the
calumnies she writes should go back to
those they concern. Her talk of [unclear]Cheevers[/unclear]
"begging [unclear]wif[/unclear]" shows that she has the
genuine proslavery spirit - & can even
a man of his undoubted orthodoxy
cannot please her, when he acts in
earnest against slavery. This conglomeration
of all wickedness seems to
have a bewitching effect on the minds
of highly [unclear]professing[/unclear] people. If some of
 the women friends of her own monthly
meeting were [unclear]envd[/unclear] and treated as slaves
are, I fancy she would open her eyes to
see that they have their hearts an not what
she wishes to make them [unclear]appear[/unclear]
 Thine truly Ruth Webb
I send 6 tracts for thy judicious distribution
