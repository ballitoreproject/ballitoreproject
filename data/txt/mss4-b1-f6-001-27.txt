if you have not forgot old promises; but as I have never been acquainted with
it, or ever heard anything particular about your family, but that you were
well, I shall not change your name [insertion]un[/insertion]till I hear from yourself, which I shall
wait with very great impatience for. I hope the good Man won't be against your
writing to a wild young fellow of the army; indeed if he is, I insist [insertion]up[/insertion]on your
writing, & letting him know, I had the honour of your acquaintance & correspondence
(probably) long before him. Indeed I expect your brother Aby, & sisters
Debby, Molly & Sally are all married - if they are, I wish them most sincerely,
all the happiness & prosperity this troublesome world can afford; & if there is any
such thing as happiness in this world, I am sure their pure & untainted, virtuous
minds must have it; for experience teaches me that true happiness
depends on a virtuous mind. I don't forget, my dear Peggy, the many hours
you have preached that to me, & the many pieces of good advice I have receiv'd
from Mrs. Carleton, your Mother, & the worthiest of men your Father,
whom I shall ever revere. I hope he has been settled [insertion]with[/insertion] with before this time, if
not, I am sorry for it: All I shall say is, that as a Lieutenant in the army, &
in the way of promotion, & (thank God I have lost neither leg or arm,) I may
without any degree of presumption flatter myself with some pretensions in
this wide world; & if ever the chance of war or fate throws me in the way of

it. I esteem him as a Father, & all of you as [insertion]my[/insertion] relations, for except my two
brothers I have none others but you; & to your Father's unbounded goodness
do I owe my existence. I am in a very unwholesome country, great mortality
here among the soldiers & officers; they die in eight or ten hours' sickness;
it's really very dreadful & melancholy to see the vast number of very
fine young fellows that die here. I have not been sick yet, God knows
how soon I may; & if I take sick I shall have but a poor chance, as most
people who are in good health & full of blood (which is my case) go off the
soonest. As to our conquest of St. Lucia, you must not expect to hear [unclear]that[/unclear]
[unclear]poorest[/unclear]. As to our conq[unclear]uest of[/unclear] [unclear]St.[/unclear] Lucia, you must not expect to hear [unclear]that[/unclear]
account of it from me, as the Gazette will give a full & very clear [insertion]knowledge[/insertion] [deletion]account[/deletion] of
it: the perseverance of the British Navy & Army on this expedition is not
to be equalled in the annals of Britain, or any other Kingdom in the
world. We live very badly here, nothing but salt-meat; all other articles
out of the reach of a Captain almost, every necessary of life is very near
500 per Cent: dearer here than at home, it's very melancholy, bad living, a desperate
political enemy, & what is worse, one of the most unhealthy Islands
in the West-Indies. I have been twice after the Count D'Estaign, with
