Dear Wm
I received yours and hardly sorry for Mr Goodwins
Situation If I could pay the whole arrear I wd do & most
cheerfully without expecting or desiring to be reimburs'd
but you know how I am Imbarrassed and the
times have made it worse I cannot get a guinea
and was obliged to borrow a pound note to Come
here and am in daily Expectation of Executions
and Ejectments If providence puts any money
in my way, the first use will be to pay the
Head land lords and stop Ejectments, I have
frequently told you my misarable Situation
wch. I Expected you wd. have Explained [insertion]it[/insertion] so fully
as to make any application unnecessary, If he
Can Contrive any way that my name Can be
of use and that in the End I would be obliged to pay
it, in that Case his father to allow me it out of
my bond together with any costs and his fathers
letter to that purpose I will so far assist wch. letter
you can have Indicted and signed before you
and transmitted to me - I will then if required
lend my name but to Engage in debts without
such Indemnity that I know I could not pay
would me madness As to then bagabowing abt.

Hannah is all nonsense I pitty her much but it was
her own head strong[unclear] sceming[/unclear] I have no place for -
any one nor will Incumber or torment self with
any one at this time of life As to my having any
thing to do with his lands was he make me a
present of them I wd. not accept them his father
who got then money (in what way and for wt Value
