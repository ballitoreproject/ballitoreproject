Skipton, 6 / 2 mo. 1763.  


Dear Cousin, 
Richard Shackleton, 
        Thy very acceptable lines came safe to hand: I cant fully express how much I thing^k^ myself obliged to thee for thy tender regard to a poor creature (even in my own opinion) sunk below thy notice; tis an obliging condescension in thee to propose commencing a correspondence with me, & will ^be^ always greatefully remembered sorry indeed shoud [sic] I have been ^if thou hadst entertained any thought that I could have been^ displeased with any part of thy letter: those passages which strike the most home to the source of my troubles: I mean my own misconduct, were not welcome; & by painful experience can I witness to the truth of thy just remarks; to walk in a path of inward, as well as outward affliction has long been my lot, nor have I any expectation of much alteration for the better in this life; bereft at times even of the flatterer hope: my out^in^ward situation is perfectly known to no one person: I am obliged frequently to endeavour to appear serene & cheerful when my poor heart is toren with conflicting passions, I have not a sufficient foundation in myself to support me under my daily trials, & my attention too much taken up & engrossed with the cares of this world. I seldom get to meetings, my husband being unwilling that any business, tho ever so trifling, should be neglected on that account. I have involved my poor children too in many perplexities, may the Lord have mercy & compassion on them, who are innocent of my transgressions & direct the^i^r feet in the right path, which I have forsaken & turned aside from: which has cost me my peace of mind.




Thou art a father of children, daughters too; tis my sincere desire they may be preserved from falling into the like error, & take warning from me, who have not had one hours solid satisfaction (I believe) since I married. I once thought no power on earth capable of drawing me so far aside; secure & confiding in my own imaginary strength, I dared at first to dally with the temptation; & am convinced by sad experience that the most trifling digression from our known duty is a very great advance to the contrary. 
        I take notice of thy observation that few who have been guilty of my crime are ever of much service in the society after. Tis not likely we shoud [sic]; the very nature of the offence & the consequences attending it exclude from a moral possibility of it: what right have we to expect miracles to be wrought in favour of the disobedient, who were knowingly so, & have neither ignorance nor a negligent education to plead excuse? Dear cousin, on perusing what I have writ, I cant but think it may appear a little particular, that I should use such freedom in my  first letter to a person I have never seen; but I am encouraged & as it were called upon to an almost unlimited frankness by thine, which shews thee to be a sincerely well-wishing & sympathizing friend, & in some measure sensible of my condition. Permit me to request the continuance of thy tender regard for me. 
        My husband, self & children are mercifully favoured with good health, tho tis a sickly time here with many. William Longmire of Leeds died lately; his death was in the last weekly papers, which was the first account we had of it. 
        My dear love attends thee, thy wife & children, from thy ^very^ affectionate kinswoman
                                                                        Elizabeth Dale.
P.S. 
Be pleased to excuse bad writing & errors: I am in haste, & have my little ones busy about me.
