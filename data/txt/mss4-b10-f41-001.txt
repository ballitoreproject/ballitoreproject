I have had a good deal of experience
in making Hay both at Dublin & in the
north & would prefer the method of lapcocks
the surest & best method of making Hay
in perfection let the weather be wet or dry
it is safe & less labour but much depends
on knowing how to make the lapcocks
while the grass is green they should be made
smaller if there is not time the day its cut
it may lye one night in the swarth next
morning shake it out & turn it with a
Rake which is better than a ptchfork as the
rake takes the whole up from the ground
& then [insertion]in the[/insertion] after noon (as thou has mentioned) make
it into lap cocks the way to make [insertion]them[/insertion] is, to gather
as much as makes one & shake the upper
part then take it up in his arms & with his
left arm hold it close to his breast & with
right arm turn in one end underneath & then
as he lays it down on the raked ground turn
in the other end also & let it stand on both [deletion][/deletion]
ends [insertion]turned up[/insertion] This makes [insertion]it[/insertion] high[insertion]st[/insertion] in the middle and

the rain falls off and leaves a hole in the
middle for the wind & air to dry it so that
the Hay is making both day & night
& even in well weather in this situation
it may stand for several days until it is
sufficiently dry [insertion]There is little or no use in turning[/insertion] for hay to make it perfect [deletion]must[/deletion]
must have time to dry sufficiently to keep it
from heating for heating is the first process
toward Rotting & so far its [deletion][/deletion] perfection
is lost & tho' the Cattle eats it [insertion]it sometimes[/insertion] causes a heat in
[insertion]their[/insertion] stomach & makes them thirsty
I dont approve of their method of making
Hay in this contry, they seem in to great a
hurry & dont give it sufficieint time to dry & their
making it in Grass cock is a ready way to
make it heat & change the colour - But its
not easy to turn people out of their old custom
especaly the work people they dont like to
stooping & using their hands at haymaking
They rather be Danglin with their pitchforks
