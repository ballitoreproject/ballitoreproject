Another little nephew! [unclear][deletion]Born[/deletion][/unclear].
29th.. Fourth day and a very windy one,
This day I enjoyed for we all seemed
rather chatty and cheerful and Papa
liked a [insertion]new[/insertion] tune I had learned; oh that
I could play well, or do any-thing to
enliven our evenings and entertain him,
but I am no good at all, a mere nonentity
I wish I had [deletion][/deletion] that most desirable
acquisition, the art of conversation.
30th.. A little nephew was born this morning
at about six O'clock, a fine boy, but
poor Elizabeth was very ill, and still in
a very precarious state. Avy has great
going in and out now. I hope he will
be greatly benefitted by all this learning.
The last day of November.
