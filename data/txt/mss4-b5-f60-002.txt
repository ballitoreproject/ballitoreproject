Anner Mills 27th Second-month 1813
My Dear friend
I took very kind thy writing of our dear E. Pope and
though too late for the post when I received the account I should have
replied but as thy sister was to write in addition I waited and
last evening I received her interesting letter It is a consolation
to me that she who was so loving to others especially
when in need of nursing should for the last four years of
her life experienced her sister and nieces affectionate society
and that she had rest from laborious service to which she
had freely given up the prime of her days. It seems as if our
dear S. L. Grubbs travail of spirit for her immortal part
revived in her recollection at the approach of Eternity and
I grasp at the hope that the effectual prayer of the
righteous availed in her case. I regret that my sister
Abigail did not see this old attached friend - David
Malcomson gave me a pleasing account of the sisters
and Neice when he called to see them; he will reflect
with satisfaction that he cultivated the opportunity, his
heart is truly susceptible of generous feeling. I have
written this Morning to James Abell he will also
feel the departure of one he delighted to serve and
when my daughter Richardson receives the intelligence she
will be affected - I wish my sympathy with the sister
and neice to be mentioned to them they must have
consolation

in having softened the bed of sickness and of being the
instrument of rendering the latter days of their dear
Relative comfortable, and respectable; Sisters [unclear]so[/unclear]
residing together, [unclear]omit refulgence[/unclear] to community. I hope our
friend Abigail Widdows will take care of her own health
the continuance of her life is of consequence to her [unclear][/unclear]
affectionate daughter I shall be obliged by stating to
me what is Abigail Widdows's Income? Several
of us many years ago understood that we reallized
Ten pounds & [unclear][/unclear] from thee, to her, and to her daughter
and Son in survivorship I am solicitious that dear E. Pope
desire for her nieces comfort may as much as possible be
fulfilled; it is not likely that she made any other will
than what she left with her kind friend in Clonmel
if it is known that she did the communication of it
should be made to him I believe she directed that her
funeral expenses should be discharged but I hope there
are not to much amount thou lately paid her Â£2.[unclear]8[/unclear]
& S.S has a Guinea in store. I wish to hear of thy restoration
to health thy confinement gave me concern and
tended to reconcile our privation of thy endearing daughter
Elizabeth whose departure from this country was
very much regretted My love salutes thee thine
I write on the other side to thy Sister thy affectionate frd
[unclear][/unclear] Grubbs
