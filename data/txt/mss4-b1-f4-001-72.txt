R. S. to his Daughter Sarah.
Ballemurry, 14th of Fourth month 1790.
*** I cannot say when I shall get home. I mean to do
all about staying and doing as well as I can; and I have a hope that a
way will be cast up for poor, blind me, that will be best. I have been
hitherto mercifully and graciously helped; and therefore, if I be preserved
from evil, I trust the same kind hand will continue to support & direct.
It is my principal dependance. I have little or no confidence in the
flesh, in my own talents, abilities, or contrivance.
My poor families with you are the subjects of my deep travail, with
earnest desires for your help and for the interference and blessing
of Heaven, among and upon you; particularly and especially thy dear
mother is the object of my faithful, affectionate solicitude, who so generously
and freely gives me up, and takes care for me at home and abroad.
So may we be united and bound up together all in the spiritual relation,
mercifully taken and kept under the notice, and forming
and direction of the heavenly hand, all children of the same everlasting
Father and Friend.
