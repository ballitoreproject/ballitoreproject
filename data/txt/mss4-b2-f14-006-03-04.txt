My dear friend,


I held myself much obliged to thee for thy very kind letter, the first which I have received from thee, but hope it will not be the last. That part of it which thy mother dictated, demands my grateful acknowledgement also- indeed your family has loaded me & mine with kindness. It is particularly pleasant & edifying, to understand by thy letter, that thy dear mother has been still enabled to get out to meet with her friends, & (which is more) that she is enabled to sit with her mind sweetly waiting upon her Lord, watching unto prayer. Thus, in the midst of the good, old Patriarch: lively effusions & blessings upon his family, he could say in that beautiful apostrophe, I have waited for thy salvation, O Lord! So present me & my family before her, & say we wish to be remembered by her in her seasons of access to our common Creator, Benefactor & Preserver. May her inward man grow stronger, as her outward grows weaker, & the freshness & greenness of spiritual youth crown her old-age! Present us also to thy dear & amiable sister Rathbone, with affectionate sympathy. She has experienced (as I, & many more have) the dissolution of the closest natural tie, the nearest connexion in this life broken, with the pangs attendant on such a dispensation- but the Everlasting husband remains, & the covenant made on his part hands [illegible]. May it be all our care diligently to wait for renewed strength & ability faithfully to keep our covenant with him to offer acceptably thy daily sacrifice, & pay our vows! I wish her & her sister Rebecca to experience best & only effectual consolation in their widowed state- this, & this only supports under every trial- this is the Rock that followed the Lords people in their wilderness- travel, of which the wise in heart drank, & this Rock is Christ

I have put thy sister D.D. & her R.Y. in my debt; but I will give them credit while they are better employed- their diligence, devotedness & faithfulness feel comfortable & edifying in the example, is (I doubt not) salutary & useful in the effect, & will be happy & peaceable in the end. My sweet friend Suky Appleby is likewise present in my remembrance, I trust she is faithful in her measure, & grows in root & branch- her welfare is near my heart. Ye have heard of the loss which we in this nation, & our society in general, have sustained in the removal of dear Sarah Grubb (Nob!). she just returned in time to give up her certificate & a short simple account of the visit paid to the continent, at our national meeting- to visit her family at home  attend the Quarterly meeting at Cork- & then fell asleep in the Lord, & rests forever from her labours, her works following her. There has been great & deserved lamentation after her.
May it be our steady care, the great business of life, to cultivate more & more an intercourse with him, who is the Preserver of men, that our experiences in Religion may be fresh & lively, & that such a savour may attend the expression of them, as may minister grace to the hearers, & virtue may be reciprocally witnessed. I believe thou hast been led, my dear friend, through a variety of dispensations (as it were through fire & through water), in order for thy own establishment in righteousness, & for a preparation to be a skillful, trained, servant in the church- & I believe thou desirest above all things to live & act acceptably in the sight of thy great & good Master, & to serve him in thy day- & therefore I trust his blessing is & will ever rest upon thee

Farewell, saith thy truly affectionate friend
