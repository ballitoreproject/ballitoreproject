I here send one of my little Paper Messengers
to convey true Love to thy Whole Self, Children, Family
and Friends, also to inform [insertion]thee[/insertion] [deletion]you[/deletion] yt. I am Well, and yt. taking
my Knapsack once abt. 5 or 6 weeks agoe, I set out from
Home towards London, in the Way to wch. City I Expos'd
my Wares about 10 times, and got as much as supported me
to yr. City. When I came there I found a Confluence of
brave Trad[insertion]e[/insertion]smen, both inland and outland Mechts.
and great plenty of Curious Cambrick fine English Cloth,
Holland-Cloth, and Irish Cloth, so yt. poor I Expos'd
by brown Linnen but twice in yt. Metropolis; for what
signifies lighting a small candle in the sunshine?
There was now at Said City one [unclear]S. Boronas[/unclear], a Wealthy
Mercht. Out of Dorsetshire a very fair and Honourable
Trad[insertion]e[/insertion]sman, both in the Retail and Wholesale way:
A punctual Payer of the King's Duties, and a Detester
of the Smugling Trade, he Delivers vast Quantities
of excellent Goods, gives large Measure, and good Penny
Worths: 'tis said he was but a black-smith somewhere
about, Sedbergh in his young years, not then w[deletion][/deletion][insertion]orth[/insertion] [deletion][/deletion]
above 5 £ p [deletion]pence[/deletion] [insertion]Ann.[/insertion] but really I think he has been at the
University, since he left the Anvil for even while he is
exposing his Traffick, he talks like a Philosopher, &

and returns as much in a week as others do in
7 years: he is now very able and rides like a
Parl[insertion]i[/insertion]ament Man. There was also another the[insertion]n[/insertion]
and there present, one John Wilson of Kendal
Clark to the Merchant Company, and to the
whole body of Tradesmen, who also has a considerable
share in Trade himself, but in a private
Way, scarce ever keeping open Shop or Stall in
publick Fairs or Markets. Pl[insertion]e[/insertion]ase to tell [insertion]him[/insertion] from
me that I think if he would keep open shop,
& not deal so like a Smugler, he wou’d get more
gain apace, and gain I know he loves well; but,
as saith the Proverb, "the Cat loves Fish, but likes
"not to wet her foot". I observe that when Tradesmen
and Merchants are met tog[deletion]a[/deletion][insertion]e[/insertion]ther in the
Royal Exchange to adjust Affairs, and confer
about Trade and the Rules of Trade, he is of
singular Service, being of Sincerity, good parts &
a Faculty not inferior to Walpole or Poulteny. Methinks
I see in the Man a peculiar Talent of
cutting out Work for others, being one of the
Directors

to the honourable Company of Merchants, yet
I do not think him too forward, but rather too backward.
I love him much, his Wife has also [deletion][/deletion] been in this Cou[insertion]n[/insertion]ty,
and her Companion: their Wares and Conduct were
such as added [deletion][/deletion] Reputation to the Business, and they
have left a good Report behind them. We hear one of
John Wilson's Daughters is setup lately: shall I not
conclude Father, Mother and Daughter being all Merchants
[deletion][/deletion] [insertion]the[/insertion] Family will be very rich in time. I wish
them good Success. We find, Dr. Friend, there are some
stirrings and revivings of Trade amongst [deletion][/deletion] [insertion]the[/insertion] young
People and Elders in London, and in this County here is
a brave Appearance of young Generals. I hope many may
be made willing in time to take up their Cross dayly
and follow the Captain of our Salvation. Therefore, having
invested the inland parts of Hampshire pretty thoroughly,
I found freedom to cross the Herring-brook into this
Isle, and may perhaps hereafter personally or literally
in due time let thee know the State of Affairs in this Isle,
touching the Trade which I have been speaking of; mean
while, my honour'd Friend, farewell, and pray for thy
poor but (I hope) true Friend
David Hall.
