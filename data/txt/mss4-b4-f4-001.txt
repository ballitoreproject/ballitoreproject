Chester 26 of 9 mo. 1773 Yatch Inn.
Dear Chandlee,
When I wrote last I was in a condition that called loud for a bed & repose, but since
that I have got my head somewhat regulated, indeed the tossing of the vessel was enough to put
steadier brains than mine out of their biass, when I wrote thee from the head I was perhaps more
likely to describe a tempest , & if thou will look at my letter thou will see such disorder as is
the natural result of confusion & will convey a more lively idea of the storm than a settled &
laboured piece can possibly frame, to that then I refer & now proceed to give some account of
my resurrection from that Chaos when lucid order dawned; at Holyhead Jackson's inn from whence
the Post Coach runs was so crowded with Engs. & Irish men waiting for a favourable gale to take
them to Dublin, that we had not a room of our own to put our heads in, much less a bed to lie
upon, however the people were civil & we got a breakfast, there are many going every day to the head
yet all the packets are afraid to sail, there is now a vessel lying sunk in the harbour with
her masts above the water; about 10in the morning we got away in a coach & four which was to take
us to Bangor ferry where the sea divides Water from antique Mona; my company consisted of a
German & Welsh man & a Scotch man, the last is Steward to the Lord Thormond & a shrewd sensible
[insertion]man[/insertion], the other two inferior servants of the Sd. Lord; thou will wonder why I parted with my
friend, this Coach holds but four, those 3 had engaged three places & the 4th remained for one of us,
upon which we fixed that John shoud set off next day with three of his acquaintances from Dublin
thou may be sure my company & I did not trouble one another much the first stage, having got
not [insertion]much[/insertion] rest for 2 nights before; we dined at /2 way house between the Hd. & the ferry & on the other
side found another Coach waiting for us, in this we drove thro' frightful narrow ways & hideous
precipices over Peninenemour by moon light to Conway, this is a very ancient place enclosed
lines precipices over Peninenemour by moon light to Conway, this is a very ancient place on
lored with ruinous fortifications built on the rocks which hang over the river, here we rested
that night; & paid with interest & honour the debt to nature which we accumulated to
high by watching & fatigue, in the morning the Coachman call'd us up about or after 6
& when we had reach'd the other side the ferry a Coach & six received us; the mountains till
rest one over the other but the way is not altogether to dangerous, one of the steepest is Penmenross,
there is a fast way between it & the sea by which we went & met the coach on the
other side, from this pathway those that dare to look down see the sea at an immense
distance underneath: we breakfasted this morning at St. Asaphs, where first was presented
to us in it perfection the neatness & cleanliness of the English inns, here an ancient matron
attended with all the courtesy imaginable & offer'd us in herself a picture of beauty in ruins
after breakfast we set out for Holywell, had a view of that delightful vale called Clyde on one
side & the bay on the other that receives the river Dee which flows thru Chester, beyond that
& the interposition of another vale is another bay into which the river Mersey flow by Liverpool,
but it is to no purpose to enter into this detail, especially as you may get them
decribed in print & more especially as no description can equal the beauty of that coast.
we dined 24th:6th:day of the week at Holywell, here it was market day, the provisions whether
meat or fruit all sweet & clean, the people's countenances recommending them;
here you are not attached going into an inn by shoals of objects extorting your compassion
all is cheerfulness, here you may indulge charity in its noblest sense I mean love, the vivacity
of the welsh women darting from their eyes, the neatness of their dress and above
all the simplicity of their address attract your attention & benevolence; remember I
am an Irish man, & prefer my country in many respects, so do not intend here any reflections
on them that are not obvious & cannot be gotten over, therefore whatever encomiums
I pay the Eng. are most likely to be merited: after dinner we got in good time to

Chester passing thru Northrop Harding & beside the new Canal we stopped at Smith
who owns in part the Post Coach & machine, in the first of which I have agreed for my
friend &me to be laid down in Londo for 6 Guineas, next day was my own, & this by
good fortune was market day here, which I spent falling in love with all the fair
dames coming to town gayly dress'd with their baskets before them fill'd with butter &
cheese, there is one entire street where these sweet lasses stand to expose their ware
& about 1000 may be seen there together, when they have sold they proceeded to buy
provisions at the meat, [insertion]fish[/insertion] & fruit markets for the following day & then gayly mouning
their Rosinants trot home, women which from their beauty [unclear]compexion[/unclear] &
dress might well pass for ladies of quality go about the markets to make
their bargains, divested of all that false delicacy wch characterises the Irish
damsels: at length my friend came up & I quitted my company to join him, & now it is time
to give some account of them; it is true they were all servants, yet none but one cou'd be discover'd
by external appearance to wear the yoke of servitude, indeed had they nothing mean but their profession
about them I cou'd have liked them well enough, considering that we are all servants to higher
powers, & no man is a slave whose mind is free, the Scotch man is [deletion][/deletion] [insertion]his[/insertion] lord's steward, & one
with whom I shou'd like to travel for the sake of his knowledge in places, both in information &
observation, the next a German is the Cook, a swearing; ill bred coward yet a civil fellow enough,
because of his flying his country on the breaking out of the late war we calld him Captain;
[unclear]Lastly[/unclear] [deletion][/deletion] [deletion][/deletion][insertion]his[/insertion] Lord's [deletion]foot[/deletion] [insertion]coach[/insertion] man I mention last & have least to say for, it is true he was of service to us
in Wales & behaved agreeable enough; thus we parted & I went to the Yacht, if ever thou
comes to Chester stop here, there is attendance & civility to dance around you; it were silly
to say what so many have before that in Chester there are 9 churches, a wall round the town
whose length is 1 3/4 miles & 101 yds. a new canal is cutting thro' the rocks on which the town stands
to join the river Dee for the conveniency of water carriage, with some difficulty I found a meeting
house to which John & I went first day morning, there were about 20 friends, this
day was held their preparative meeting which they did not invite us to stay for, so we went
our ways, next morning about 9 o'clock we were called up to get into the Post coach, which
runs from hence to Londo. in 2 days, two gentlemen stepp'd in with us & we shoulder'd
one another into something like the shadow of conversation till we fell asleep, at
wch. time to be sure we were not wanting to meet one another's civility with very low
bows; towards day daylight, as the morning dawned & we proceeded from the profile
to the features of one another's countenance we discoursed a while in dumb shew, looked
at one another's breeches & stockings & found out that they were not [insertion]all[/insertion] of a colour as they
had been an hour before, in short with a little Physiognomical skill we traced out
a little of each his neighbour's dispositions, & at last settled matters in a very
amicable manner without bloodshed; indeed an unfriendly aspect was not like to do
much on our side, for one was armed with a case of Pistols, a sword & a swaggering
tongue, & the other with the utmost mildness & complaisance, so seeing how we
were station'd we adapted the muscles of our faces accordingly; if thou has a mind
to know what towns we passed thro' & how many miles we made from place to place
I will tell thee when I go home pointing them out in my map; if thou must have an

account of every particular town, that is, how many churches & houses & souls there are in it, consult
the gazeteer. ~ We travelled first day thro 3 or 4 coaches & by the assistance of 12 or 16
horses to Coventry, the country exceeding pleasant, especially where ever the new canal
appears which they are cutting for the sake of water carriage; most houses are built
of brick, except some barns which are enclosed with boards & last a considerable time
they tell you longer than even the stone, the sides of almost all country houses are
lined with vines which suspend their large green clusters in this season, the yards
are many confined within pales, which have a particular neatness; in N. amptonshire
most houses are of stone, but there were few that put me in mind of my country
except that sometimes a patriotic sigh broke out for the miseries of poor Ireland, finding
myself stung with the contrast, we got into Coventry about 10 o'clock at night, being favoured
by the moon -- that wants to love the traveller's bevizon -- Coventry had nothing in it
to attract our attention but a fair fille de Chambre, & the hurry all night of the machines
setting out every minute in[deletion]to[/deletion] the 24 hours, in the mor[insertion]n[/insertion]ing we were roused at 3 & farewel Coventry
I haste to nobler scenes, we dined at Dunstable, & in the evening stopped at High Barnet
took leave of our company & hired a Post chaise, which was ready at 5 min. warning, but before
we part our company let us say something of them, one was Kelly of Dublin an enormous
man, very good humour'd & possessed with a strong itch to be witty, which like many
he made to consist in profanity, calera totus, the Cheshire man is modest & reserved, it was
sometime before I discover'd the Acedemic [insertion]education[/insertion] in him, which I look upon to be his chief ornament
I [deletion][/deletion] compare him to the admirable structure of my watch, of which we observe the
particular use & beauty, but do not immediately discover the springs on which it turns
the road to Lond.o from within 16 or 17 miles seems like some great suburbs, there
is a jumble of city grandeur & rural beauty, the road is like a great cheese full of mites
creeping alive, & as close lin'd with carriages of all sorts as the lines in this letter, with
some degree of latitude in proportion & allowance to a traveller, there were about 4 coaches
& 4 times as many horses concerned about setting our lordship down in Fanner's end.
This is a selected spot in a street of Edmonton, known by the name of Silver street about 7 miles Nor.
of Londo. & 2 miles from Tottenham, where is the meeting house, I have been at Londo. several times:
today I visited W.minster abbey & the elephants &c. of these things it were impertinent to write, but
one thing I can assure thee of, there is something remarkably curious in the manners of some of these
people, I mean among friends, there are not many of that denomination here that can be known in company
to be such, & among these few, there are still fewer that have enlarged sentiments of hospitality & cordiality.
glory, my friend, in the characteristic of thy country plain open hearted ingenuity & honest freedom, notwithstanding
that noble spirit of freedom & inpatience under restraint which these people boast in
public life their private concerns all point to that loadstone Gold, wch. is the very centre of their action
in that all their designs ultimately terminate, & that is the star by which they are influenced, it were scarce
credible to imagine all the inconsistency introduced in their conduct on this account, every father enforces this
rule in his children Quaerenda pecunia priemum est Viritus post nummum, & if he has a daughter, she must
be meas'd up alive like Jessica the Jew's pretty daughter, if a young man is observed to frequent the house where this
Danae is lodged he is immediately observed & suspected by all the neighbours & the family & perhaps prohibited
think what monstrous marriages are formed, when the young people are not yet acquainted with one another
nor have felt any sort of Sympathy to form the union, or a sanction from heaven to establish it; this is the case
I am told among some friends, I fear there are too few exceptions, I can say nothing of the rest of the world, but
if we may judge of the causes from their effects, the unhappiness & infidelity of some in marriages, & the Celibicy
of a great number, which is the more excusable evil of the two, evince that something of this sort reigns
among them. Together with this Jewish thirst for Gold, they seem many of them to borrow the formality

& piercing aspect of that people; there are many of them immensely rich & immensely covetous,
one that is acquainted in any degree with this people will never doubt that wch St. Paul observes of the love of
money. This makes some of them [deletion][unclear][/unclear][/deletion] the greatest oddities in the world, some wholly intent on the golden
prospect forget their dress & are two or three ages behind in point of fashion while they observe with the moderns
to crouch & bend to the golden image, not one characteristick of a primitive Quaker is to be found about
them for all the serenity of a countenance void of anxiety all neatness & simplicity of dress & purity of language
is quite out of fashion, our fathers or this generation have been grossly deluded, for these singularities
which they maintained & for which they gloriously suffered are now looked on as mere sanctimonious
formality, there is another mighty evil too got in & which plagues me more than all, there are some friends
of plain appearance who tease the meeting with unintelligible jargon & lifeless words, these scandalize
their plain appendages & bring them into odium, cause others to doubt of the truth & stay at home rather
than come to set where their meditations are constantly interrupted, notwithstandg. there are who grace
the assemblies with living energy after all give one the gay yet sober country I wou'd not live in Londo.
for the city; before I quit this head I must say that plainness may be found in every habit of dress & address
however various, therefore we must not pretend to set up our own country as the criterion of simplicity,
no more than our own opinion the measure by wch that of others is to be found, for if we place any virtue
in dress (wch would be absurd) we shoud study that of our Saviour who certainly was habited in a
quite different man[insertion]ner[/insertion][deletion]y[/deletion] from us, whoever then will judge of a foreignce by himself must be very ignorant
or indulge ideas exceedingly contracted. London is that spot on this globe where every thing is to be
met with people of all habits & all manners, but what they seem to possess in common is, a contempt for
every nation but their own, if they ask you a question of the manners & customs of yr country it is only to make
some impertinent remark, some odious observation. Among friends I like the manners of conducting the
church affairs, to get an idea of it consider the Irish process of the business, one or two read the quiries &
give their opinion while the rest are in stupid inattention, here friends seem to be interested in the case
& that occasions sometimes a variety of sentiments about modes but never about principles among the
chief speakers, this give the assembly the air of confusion & discord which the Irish meetings are
acquitted of from their general concord, whereas if they agree at all there, it is that they think nought
about it, I speak of the generality, from whom the situation of any society or people is to be known respecting
their manners & dispositions. I hope to write again between this & Dublin; thou may
percieve that this has been written at different times & places; if thou writes to me direct to
E. Burke St Gregories near Beaconsfield, where perhaps I shall find thy letter, say how thy
father is.
I am, dear Chandlers
