My dear sister,
in my room, for the purpose of washing & combing, & [deletion]this[/deletion]
being done I thought I would begin a reply to thy two
kind letters, just received, which I expect to send by
George Courtney, whose sisters are daily expected here to
call on him: - I suppose I should be apt to write oftener
to thee only I grudge the postage of letters [underline]I write[/underline] always
almost; - could I give one of the pleasant-looking daughters
of N: Chaylor a packet now & then to send free, I
of N: Chaytor a packet now & then to send free, I
suppose I should avail myself of it, & perhaps sometimes
intrude on thy hours of hurry: - yet I am I confess rather
reluctant to continue writing without replies, - thou knows
we cannot go on talking to a person if they do not speak
in return: But do not think I am scolding [underline]at[/underline] thee, no
I am not, when thou speaks, or writes, it is to my satisfaction,
& when thou art silent I by no means take it
[underline]ill[/underline]: I do not say but I long to hear from thee. Cousin S. J. G
& I have had a brave heat at writing, whereby I heard of
thee, & thy Cork expidition, which, tho' attended by some trials,
I hope proved satisfactory to thee, "No Roses [underline]here[/underline] but what on thorns [insertion]do grow[/insertion]."
It is pleasant to hear of my Munster friends regarding me,
I love many of them [underline]well[/underline], dear J:A is of the number tho'
I see, & feel, a great declension in [underline]his[/underline] towards me, which
I suppose he thinks proper. I feel ashamed to be saying
a deal about myself, or I could complain heavily of both
body & mind; if I should live much longer I am afraid
I shall be troublesome with my complaints; - but I mean to
[underline]strive for[/underline] resignation, Oh that it may be granted!

This being my day for having a fire

I am pleased at thy not disapproving of my staying from
Mt. Mellick, I was thinking of not going to Dublin either, but
Saml. Elly said this would not do he thought, so I suppose I
[underline]shall go[/underline], under discouragements many. I was surprised to
hear of dear Betsy Dudley's publick appearance, I wish her
well on her way with all my heart, - she is amongst tender
feeling friends, of which I expect she will feel the benefit:
& I am sure I hope, after [underline]struggling[/underline] to be faithful for
upward of 20 years she may not [underline]then[/underline] come under censure.
M: L put a little poem in my hand the other day, a copy of
which I sent to cousin S, J, G, â€“ she can shew it thee, or I
would copy it for thee. The fits poor brother Chandlee had
so many of, seem entirely at an end, - but his weakness
is so great he seems almost ready to die with the fatigue
of putting on fresh flannels & linen, shaving &c. wch.
his faithful wife has to do, save the shaving: his chief
sustenance is wine, which she gets from Carlow, because
something cheaper than here. The young-woman at John
Thomas's (Isabella Robinson) has gradually declined, & is now
on the awful verge of Eternity, & tho' the dear creature
does not utter any extraordinary eloquent dying sayings,
yet is she sweet & placid, & very patient considering
her sufferings, loving & thankful to every one about her:
her mother, who has been a while with her, was obliged
to hurry home to her other daughter who was ill, & who,
we since hear, is apparently rapidly going as her sister.
Thou hast done thy part (kindly) about Anna's quilts, for
which both she & I are obliged to thee, & others for ought
I know. If Wm. Conner considers poor Judy's situation, &
reminds his brother of it, I think it will be an act of
charity

charity: she was exceedingly grateful for the Pound note
he sent her by me. Poor Molly, I fear her husband will
work her too much: - had she any thing sav'd eer she
enter'd the life of care & expence? I doubt that she sings
so much now as when under the mild government of my
dear brother Saml., whom I love in my heart, tho' I may
omit saying so in every letter I write: I suppose you
have Ally & Nancy still, if so remember my love to them,
Sally Averil, & Jenny Taylor. Last sixth-day was our mo:
meet.g, I went along in a Carlow return 5th day noon, T: Bewley
T: Barrington & James White came in the morning: When
the women meet.g seperated I kept Sarah Watson in the
womens room while I read her most of thy last
letter, which she seemed comforted to hear: she
is still with Eliza: Watson, who is recovering from
a dangerous lying-in: I know not whether she has fix
upon leaving Ballydarton, I want her to come board with
H: Haughton, & held out the probability of her doing us
good, as an inducement, - but she does not seem to incline to it
I do not know how Dinah feels about her children, -
"Wherever yet was found the mother, would give her daughter for another"?
I am glad to hear of little Frances being so improved, I
think there was room for it, I suppose [underline]all[/underline] have satisfaction
of him [underline]now[/underline]: - do give my love to the little fellow,
for I do love him: Our little Hannah White is delightful
& encreasingly so, her mother expects to be confined latter
end of 6th, or beginning of 7th month. Mary Pim is to be
pitied, - trouble - trouble, the lot of man. Do tell my Garriroan
friends I remember them with feelings of grateful
affection: how goes on Sam: Fennel? I handed out thy loves,
which were acceptable to thy friends here: Richd. Pike made
considerable exertions to send his love to thee, - he seems

declining gradually. I told Eben: of thy being pleased at
his attendance of Q M: - I suppose they may, & do, profit
[underline]some[/underline], but I fear the conduct of some at those gatherings
is far from profitable. Now have I not written thee
a great letter? I have plan'd to send it by George Courtney,
who is about to leave school, - we shall miss him, he
is a very pleasing youth.
is a very pleasing youth. My dear sister farewell.
Abram & Lydia send
their love to thee.
My dear sister farewell.
