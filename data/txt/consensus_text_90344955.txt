I think he must have been
tolerably fatigued.
16th.. Did not go out until
after dinner when Philip
& I went to ride - tho' but for
a short time, I wanted him
to let me try the leap Polly took
but he thought if safer not
so we returned home by the
brows &c &c - Papa came out
after tea - I had a letter from
P J Westall who has not I am
sorry to hear, been very well -
Her brother Tim is also very delicate
poor little fellow -
17th.. Charlie rode out to breakfast
and surprised us all - Philip
& I went to meeting where
I met Polly -, I got an
invitation to spend a few
days with Florence but whether
I shall go or not is another
thing. We overtook Ned
on our way to Cabinteely
and called to see Grandmama
who seemed very well -
