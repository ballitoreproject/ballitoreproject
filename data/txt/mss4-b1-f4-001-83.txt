is indeed worth aspiring after. It comprehends life eternal: it is
not seated in the head, the region of the imagination, but it occupies
the heart; and, like the sense of feeling, pervades the whole
inward man. Thou knowest, dear William, something of this Divine
nature; it was the precious sense of it which caused in thee such
a disrelish for insipid, lifeless, outward, unsubstantial forms.
Continue to hunger and thist after it, and it alone, and in due
season thou wilt be fed. Be content, yea, glad to be preserved one
of the babes in Christ, who are nourished by the milk of the word;
and not one of the wise and prudent of this world, from whom
the gospel of life and salvation is impenetrably hid.
M.W shines in her gift; our dear M.G. in her line, appears
clothed with the spirit of the gospel; dear S.W's little effusions
are very acceptable; R.G. I hope, well concerned. So we are
getting on as well as we can, cautious and fearful, that so we
may do no hurt.
R. S.
