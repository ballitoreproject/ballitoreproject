86 was but small, yet several testimonies born: - dear A: Summerland twice, & MD twice. - I went through some conflict of mind in this meeting; - After it when taking leave of A:S she tap’d me on the shoulder saying, “dear child be faithful.” After dining with Hannah Reynolds, [unclear] Ball (dear Richd. from home also) we went to Newport to lodge, M:D continuing very poorly; - but got a better night than the one before, & was able to leave it about 10 seventh morning for Nampturich, where we arrived safe about 7 o’clock, having for guide our kind friend Geo: Titringer[?] went to meeting 1st day at 11, which was to me a painful one, because of my own stupidity: after a long sitting George stood up: - After him MD who I thought indeed preached to my state, even about the sluggard who was to be cloathed in rags. - After dinner we came 10 miles to lodge, to Temporley[?] - a clever inn. - Set out on 2d day
