My dear Sarah
I have no doubt, but, that you will allow
I have seized the most agreeable opportunity possible
for answering your kind letter, and expect that
mine will be doubly welcome on that account.
Indeed, I understand that my [unclear]Mercury[/unclear] visits
Ballitore / and I believe it is from his own
lips I received the intelligence of simply and
singly in obedience to [unclear]August[/unclear] - I need not
add [underline]who is his Venus[/underline] on the present occasion.
A [unclear]fna pas[/unclear] to that Goddess, I think the Aneighton
one still looking delicate, and I am afraid
will never recover their former bloom -
Jane had the spirit to encounter successively,
William, my father and Mr.
[unclear]J Finbar[/unclear], at chess, and acquitted herself, very
honourably; - she won one game from
William, out of there, and with very
little assistance, on her side and an
to afford them relief - My father
was employed on this business on
a very wet day, and necessarily
suffering the inclemency of the
weather with, out, and within
doors, in their wretched shades
standing in wet clothes, taking
down names, trades, &c &c
it is not surprising that the
consequence was a violent
Cold.-
I have not read Miss Hamiltons
life but then her good application

oversight or two upon theirs, head each of her other
antagonists once also.
Mary is a great [unclear]gabbler[/unclear] abroad and gives
us, her company, seldom, three days in the
week: She has read Strathallan, which I
have been too busy to peruse, as yet, having
advanced only half way through the first
volume. I suppose you have heard ere
tho's, that it is a production of my cousin
Alicia Le fann's, it is in four volumes
written in an elegant & forcible style
indicative of an highly [unclear]adticiated[/unclear] and
accomplished mind in the Author.

months from its first publication,
prepassing to enter a second edition.
I spent a delightful evening at Cuffe
street on Friday - we were all asked
to meet Mr Younge [insertion]the actor[/insertion] but the remainder
of the family, were prevented by colds from
accepting of the invitation - there was
no company except Tom, Emma and
[unclear]four[/unclear] of the Miss Guinnesses, pleasing
of the passage your cited very just -
Josuah Harvey leaves Dublin tomorrow
for Edinburgh!!! Need I add any thing
to this sentence to make it impressive?
No, I flatter myself that
it speaks already to the heart and
needs not the aid of foreign or [unclear]nomerd[/unclear]
Ebenezer I understand came to
town to purchase a house for Deborah's
use - I hope he met with
one which pleased him -
I hear frequently good accounts
of her & hope I shall soon

well informed girls; and Mr Younge lent
himself out and was quite charming company
- He has a pleasing, harmonious voice,
a variety of tone, and brilliancy of
diction - He gave us an animated description
of the present state of the French
Theatre, and initated their chief tragic performer,
the great Talmas, in a striking
scene from "Andromache" - He also
sung with great taste and feeling three or
four of the melodies, having
respect to the sense as well
as to the music, of what
he sung, he expressed the sentiment
he uttered; the rarest perfection in a
singer, and that which gives me most
pleasure, not being a scientific connoisseur,
though the greatest, possible, uninstructed
am√†teur.
Mrs. Preston has been confined to her
bed, in a bilious fever, for more than
a fortnight but is at present, sitting
up, in a state of recovery.

of the 20,000 & subscription raised at
the mariners house, an inquiring
