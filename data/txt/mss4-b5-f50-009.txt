Limerick - 9th Month 23rd 1819.
My dear friend
I received thy letter dated the 29th.
ult. accompanying a letter for Jacob Hawey, which I
shall take care of, & a most acceptable present from
Lydia, for which please to give her my sincere thanks.
I congratulate thee, & thy friends on thy restoration
of thy health, which, I hope, may continue long unimpaired.
I hope to have the pleasure of seeing thee again, both before
& after my departure for Edinburgh, as I have wished
to [deletion]make[/deletion] take Clonmel & Ballitore on my [unclear]sond[/unclear]--My
uncle Hawey is at present at [unclear]Monkstown [/unclear], near Cork, with
his daughters Mary, & daughter-in-law Hannah, he is improving
rapidly. - I have read the critique on Crabbe's
"Tales of the Hall" in the last Edinburgh Review, & was
pleased to find that he still continued to be the Poet of
Nature. The reviewers call him the Rembrandt of English
poetry. - I left the [unclear][/unclear] myself in Cumming's shop, so

I suppose they are lying in some hiding place there. I received
a long letter last seventh-day from Jacob Harvey, which I intend
to take with me & show thee. - However, it may be better to send
part of it now; "A settlement of British emigrants has been formed
in Pennsylvania adjoining this state, which I think promises to
be a more agreeable abode than Illinois. Thomas Barrington
son of Thomas Barrington of Ballitore, has lately emigrated there
with his wife & seven children, & he writes in an encouraging
style. He had planted a good deal of grain & vegetables, & the
latter was almost fit for use - his farm contains about 130 acres
I sincerely wish him success, for he is a very industrious worthy
little man, & his wife is an amiable woman. If thou hast
an opportunity, thou may inform his relatives in Ballitore, of his
present abode & prospects. &&& "When in Philadelphia the other
day, I learned that Peter Widdows had left the city some time
ago, but when he intended pitching his tent I could not discover.
Perhaps this news will be interesting to his mother, if she has not
heard from him lately. Remember me to her & Becky." "Kind remembrance
to all my Ballitore friends."
Acknowledge, if thou please, my letters from Betsy Shackleton &
Sally White, perhaps I may answer them in propria persona
Have you seen the third report of the Deaf & Dumb Institution.
Edward Alexander sent it to me a few days ago. It is

exceedingly interesting & encouraging? - Hannah Dawson is
with us still. I hope she will see Ballitore before she returns
home. - My love to Henry & Edward, & tell them I
hope to see them soon -- I suppose you were very much gratified
with the visit from my uncle & Sally Christy. The
last accounts of my uncle's health are favorable He is now
following the prescriptions of a Limerick physician, who differs
from all the rest whom he consulted. If any of you write
here soon, please to inform us how Hannah Davis is, her
friends here are much interested about her. - My grand[unclear][/unclear]
enjoys usual health- she frequently goes out in a [unclear]jaun[/unclear]
I hope Deborah is as well as usual. - Tell Lydia that
I intend to take her [unclear]Round[/unclear] when I am going, & that she
may continue to take charge of my other books, & return
them all together. - With affectionate remembrance to all my
Ballitore friends, as well as to Harriet Lefann,
I remain thine sincerely,
Thomas Fisher.
