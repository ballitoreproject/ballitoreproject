My dear Uncle

I had the satisfaction of receiving ^in^ a Frank from Sister Peggy thy letter to her with the account of your safe arrival in Ireland after a providential escape upon that awful unstable element where many have been translated to their unchangeable state  every preservation of this kind whether to ourselves or our friends (especially those to whom we are bound in the best fellowship) calls for our grateful commemoration & greater dedication to so wise & merciful a Protector  Sister Peggy wrote me a few lines expressive of the afflicted state she was then in by the sudden removal of one of their apprentices  I am afraid she will receive injury to her health by this distressing event  I inclose a few lines to her which please to forward 
	Our families here are generally well except my dear mother who came the other ^day^ went with us to our monthly meeting yesterday where exercise of Body & mind fasting & eating operated strongly against her health by bringing on something of a gouty cholic to which she is subject is rather better this evening & sitting bye desires to be affectionately remembered to thee & thine
D & E Priestman are well as usual  they & us about two weeks ago took a ride to Guisbro [?] monthly meeting held at Castleton to which Betty rode all the way & back on horseback about sixty miles without receiving any hurt  we went out very low & in much fear knowing where we were venturing our heads but keeping as we went out I beleive [sic] was a means of entitling us to a degree of peace in our return  they both desire their dear love to thee & Betty bid me say that if thou ^hast^ freedom to write her a few lines, they will be very acceptable to her 
	I was favored to get well home from Lancaster the 1st day following or rather to York was at Leeds meeting that day where my Husband met me 
	Last week Ackworth general meeting was held
