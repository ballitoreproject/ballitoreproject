My dearest Aunt -
It is something
new for me to be writing to you
to the continent, It certainly
is a variety & I hardly know
myself. I often try to imagine
you are at Ballievey. but
this thin paper and the 4
stamp wont let me - Were you
ever in Paris without me? -
how does it look? Charming
I suppose. Is the walk as hot
as ever coming for this letter
Oh how we used to quicken
our footsteps in front of the
Palais Royal to gain the shade
of Rue de Grenelle from thence
to Rue Jean Jacques Rousseau to
the Post Restante, you see

I remember it all well; as
I dont know what hotel you
are in, your walk may be
different, besides I know Rue
de Riveli is much altered
& I believe now extends by the
Louvre to the Palais Royal
ai je raison? - how
I would like to visit with
you our old friends "Les
Passages" and once more
to sit in the Evenings in
Champs Elyse√©s, even yet
I think I know it better
than Dublin, however give
my best respects to Paris
and dont forget "mon ami"
if he is still at that handsome
fountain in Boulevart
St Martin -
Here I am gossiping away about
Paris "dear Paris" instead of
telling you home news. I
must contain myself I love
Paris so much - I cannot help it -
We were glad to get your
letter begun on the Connaught
& finished in the Railway
yesterday, & were expecting
another this morning telling
of your visit to the "Villa" -
but were disappointed did
you go there to Tea - if so
I do not wonder at you not
writing - We are just as you
left us. Uncle Manliff was
not very well yesterday he Said
it was the Herrings I gave
him for dinner on Wednesday
that he eat too much of them
however he is much better
to day & I believe going to Dublin
Uncle Arthur has returned
greatly disappointed at not
seeing you he left the "Nonna"
behind for the wind was

and still continues contrary
he just got into Campbeltown
in time for the Storm
which was awful from
his account and continued
till Monday. They were obliged
to hold ropes to keep themselves
on deck. The Skipper
said he never saw a storm
come on so suddenly bad
how fortunate they were not
at sea - You had a
nice day for crossing, we
had a little rain that
evening but not enough
to do any good the weather
is still fine with a south
west wind [insertion]blowing pleasantly[/insertion] and Thermometer
up to 71. now 10 oclock AM -
Mama not come yet, a
few lines from her last
night, spoke of coming tomorrow
I write to her, but our letters
