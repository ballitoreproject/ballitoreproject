Dublin 30th of 3rd mo: 1813
My dear Elizabeth - Tis thy turn now
I may lawfully say to be honour'd I with a
letter from me. I wrote to my mother yesterday
& left my letter a P Lefanus as William
offer'd to send any letters to you free this is
to go by Mary Cox who is going to Ballitore
to see her father, how is he? I did not know
he was ill till to day I have bought two purse
clasps Richard has not arrived yet to my
knowledge but I intend to look for him I
was dreaming of thee & him last night so
who knows but I may see him to day I
don't know what packet he is to come in
therefore I wont know what to ask for
I went to see the Panorama to day
& was half delighted [insertion]at the grandeur of the thing[/insertion] but wholly shock'd at the
battle how different from the peaceful
shades of Ballitore where I shall be wholly
I hear thou wert keeping thy bed for some
days but I hope thou'rt better
I'm almost ashamed to write to thee there
is so much diference between thy letters &
mine however if suffices to say I love thee
dearly thine SB I'm sorry I cannot see
Jane Stephens but as she lives in the country
it is out of my power
30th of 3.d mo 1813 Dublin

delighted & not even half shock'd how
does our garden look are the leaves coming
fast on the trees does thou ever go to
look at the bathing house I long to see
every one & every thing in Ballitore
again & hope I will before the end of
this week if Richard be here in time
Did thou hear that Miss Honeywell was
married to the keeper of the wild beasts
& had two kangaroos for Bride's maids

by friend Cox How are E & D S my
dear love to them did Margaret
get safe home she was sadly [unclear]disappointed[/unclear]

about going to England I miss'd seeing
Richard & Susan did thou see
John Whitton's case perhaps if thou'd
ask George he would show it to thee
I think thou'd be highly diverted at it
A F has not return'd yet how are the
new houses going on has Doctor Davis
left the Cottage yet dost thou often see
S Fitzsimmons's little child I hear its
a [unclear]beauty[/unclear] & long to believe it did [unclear][/unclear]
