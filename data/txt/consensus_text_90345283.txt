be late - spent most of the day in here.
Liddy and I went to meeting with Margt to
meet Polly who had gone out with Thomas
Henry to Uncle Richards to breakfast - We two
had settled to go to the country with Papa so wished
to see Polly first; so had a little conversation
before meeting - which we attended for a short
time. Went out to Fassaroe with Papa by
11Â½ train.
5th.. Papa and Mama went early to town
this morning - My poor tooth is gradually
recovering the effects of the pulling and has
ceased aching - a great comfort. I got
but little of the meeting and enjoyed
that little not much, owing to the weary
tooth. Charlie and Mama came out. [insertion]this evening[/insertion]
6th.. Seventh day -. showery - Papa came
out early & Charlie went in.
7th.. Went to meeting with Liddy in the
covered car, Philip and Avy following
