whose power over [insertion]me[/insertion] was so absolute that it drove me to
the utmost extremity & despair, it was wth. the greatest

great Malice he sought my destruction but
casting an Eye of Mercy & compassion on my
lost & deplorable Condition has miraculously
preserved my life from the Enemy's power & has

for sin thou wouldest not but a broken heart & Contrite Spiritt thou wilt not
dispise, what said my Servant Samuel unto Saul, who speared of the flock
for a Sacrifice, behold Obedience is better than Sacrifice, & to Obay than the fat
of Rams, confuted as it were thus far in my Opinion, my troubled Soul thus
Expressd her Grief, is there Lord no other way but this, wherein I may live
agreeable to thy holy will, must I then wholy renounce the Opinion it pleased thee
I should be brought up in (which as my natural mother) cleams me as her Child O! most
severe & firery tryal, I read thy word is sharp & perceing, Yea sharper than any two edged sword,
& so indeed I find it to be, even to the dividing asunder the joints and marrow, what will my friend
& all the world say of me, if I profess an Opinion of a people so much dispiced? O that when born
I had given up the Ghost then had I been at peace after these Reflections I endeavoured to

to Compose my self but in vain my soul like a troubled sea found no
rest & I heard as tho' a voice had procl[deletion][/deletion]a[insertion]i[/insertion]med these words knowest thou O
weak Woman whose will thou thus disputes Concider & dare not to
Offend me Remember I am God able to kill & make alive will thou

both body & Soul in hell obay my will and thou shallt find it
will be well with thee as to what the world may say of thee
Remember it is enmity with Christ & they who are in it have
no part in him that canst not serve God & Mammon if
then thou wisely makes choice of my service adhere to
this the day of thy Visitation & thou shall assuredly [insertion]find[/insertion] my
Grace Sufft. for thee Otherwise it will be hard thou'l find
to disobay & cast my word behind thee Remr. Saul he stood
not disputing - in this Circumstance my whole desire
& prayer to God was that he would speak to me no more
in wrath lest I shd be consumed with the breath of his
displeasure I could not make use of the form[insertion]s[/insertion] of prayer
I used to do by reason they rather augmented then
eas'd the Conflicks my Soul Laboured under like
medecine wrong applyed I then truly saw my own
weakness that of myself I knew not what to pray
for

for but the Spirit greatly helped mine infirmities
with Sighs & Groans unutterable Still unwilling to
reveal the conflicts I laboured under, on Accot. of my
Sisters illness: I strove as much as possible to keep my
concern to myself well knowing it was God alone, & his
Holy Word, that could relieve me; to wch. I ever fled
as the Anchor of my Hope & Salver of all my doubts.
There was at that time in the Neighbourhood a
Person. Her name was Drummond, who professed
the Opinion of the Quakers, whom as a Stranger, many
People went to hear her speak: I among the Rest being
asked if I would go, which I refused unwilling to leave
my Sister in her illness but it is impossible to express
the Self condemning thought, I laboured [insertion]under[/insertion] after this time
in Vain were all Reasons I could urge in my own behalf.
My heart condemn'd as guilty of a great error, As did
God who is farr greater than our own heart. So great was
my concern it shewed itself in all my Actions, insomuch
that all that saw me, enquired what could be the reason,
which I no longer Scrupled to discover upon which they
immediately sent for the Clergy-man of the Parish who
took much pains to convince me of what he thought so
Groundless an Opinion. But in Vain are all Arguments
against matters of fact, Disputes quench, but can not
baffle

baffle the Spirit of God, nor the Mind Once convinced of
its influence, it is a Bosom friend a faithful monitor.
Impartial & not to be Byassed which since I by disputes have
vexd & quenched; Ive been (O Grief to tell:) a Second Magdalen,
but Christ on her sincere Repentance, Reced & Cured
even her. & God has been so merciful as to spare my life
hitherto, & has done great things for my Soul's deliverance.
I am not faithless, but believing if these are his chosen
People as Sure I by experience, must believe they are,
that through faith in Christ, and his name God will at
their request rid me of my dread companion, thereby
making known his Glory & Power that he is the same
God he ever was whose arm is not shortened that it cannot
save neither his ear heavy that it cannot hear but it
is my iniquity that separates between me & my God
and my Sins & Disobedience that have caused him
to turn his face from me but tho' I should incur the
displeasure of the Whole World by the Discovery of
the truth God forbid I should conceal it any longer
from any for should I lie against my right my wound
would be incurable but I will declare it that I may
be refreshed yea I will open my mouth in defence of the
Truth wch. I have delayed to long to do or I had not
been

given up into the hand of the Enemy whos malice
seek my life but his power goes no further than God
permits who has mercifully spared me & will I hope
in his good time set my soul at liberty to bear testimony
to the Truth & [deletion]by[/deletion] [insertion]be[/insertion] his faithful penitent entirely
devoted to his service

PS
I dare no longer except any man's person neither give
flattering [unclear]titles[/unclear] for in so doing my Maker would soon
take me away for what indeed am I that I should dare
to stand in opposition to the Almighty shall the
clay say to him that formed it why hast thou made
me thus God sp[insertion]e[/insertion]ake once yea twice but I perceived
it not in a Dream in a Vision of the Night when deep
Sleep fell upon me when I was slumbering upon
my bed then opened he mine ears to receive instruction
to withdraw my heart from vanity & to lead me in the
way everlasting to keep back my soul from the pit &
my life from the Enemys Power but he hath chastned
me with multitudes of pains & afflictions so that
my life abhord bread & my soul dainty meat because I
have rebelled against the will of the Lord & have not
followed the commandment of my God but my soul
has

has indeed experienced his mercies to be boundless & unlimited
therefore doth she love & greatly love & fear him
for she to whom much is forgiven gratitude demands
that she should love much for this is only the return
we can make or that God requires of us surely it is
a pleasing task for love makes all things easy &
we love not our own souls if we love not God even
to [deletion]lean[/deletion] [insertion]laying[/insertion] down our lives if his service requires we
should for his sake who spared not his for our
sake to reconcile lost man to his offended father
Oh let not any therefore delay returning to God
or dispair of his mercies on their sincere repentance
since I who drank of that bitter Cup have
thro mercy received some glimmerings of
hope that God will not cast off for ever nor
shut up his old loving kindness in displeasure
so as not to pardon how did he receive the prodigal
Nay he tells us that there is Joy in
heaven over one Sinner that repenteth
more than over ninety & nine just persons
that need no repentance -
