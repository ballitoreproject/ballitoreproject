Carlow 9th month 8th 1781

Dear Master,
	I am favoured with thine by bearer & agreeable to thy orders have sent by him the wine [?edge of paper] & diaper [?], with the weavers bill inclosed.
	Suppose you have been alarmed with the tidings of the French fleet &c being hovering about the western Coats, it has caused a great hubbub & movement of the army.
	Our Volunteers are very busy raising Subscriptions & provideing [sic] ammunition  They have again applyed to us for Subscriptions with the resolves [?] of their meeting intenting [?] which were to return the names of such as refused to their Collonell [sic] & I hear they purpose advertising our Society. They importuned me very hard to contribute & alleged that their intention was not for carrying on War, but for the protection of Property. I told them we could not in any case voluntarily contribute towards the arraying man in a millitary [sic] way   
I must own it was a very great tryal [sic] to me to refuse them  And I found very great necessity for inward Strength which thou pertinent recommends waiting for in thy kind Letter with many more heretofore, for which I am much indebted to thee & hope to retain a greatful [sic] remembrance thereof 
	I have been very deeply tryed [sic] and Providence in his Wisdom (I have thought at times) has suffered them to increase ^of late^ by a variety of proveing [sic] Seasons. Since the removal of my dearly beloved wife  I have found greater necessity & more want of divine Assistance than ever I did before, and I hope to be enabled to continue more & more to know, where to seek for help 
	I am in haste with dear love to thee the mistress & family  thine very affectionately Sam Haughton
