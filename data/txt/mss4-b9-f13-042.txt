Summerville 30th December 1838
My dearest Sarah.
This will be the last letter I suppose
that I shall write to thee in this year. - I hope
I shall be a better correspondent to thy house
during the ensuing as beside thyself I shall
have my dear Mag to remember. - I busied
myself almost the whole of last night dreaming
of thee & Edward & the children & of
Fassaro, so as there is a parcel going to
Dublin I felt quite inclined to prolong
my being amongst you even into the May
I hope you are all well & that the Christmas
found you well & the new Year will see
you enter his borders so. - Oh! may you
have many returns of this season &
meet it in peace & joy whenever it
comes. - I had dear Richard which was
most pleasant to me & still have
Sally. - Indeed a couple of weeks ago
I thought I should not be blessed with the
health which I now have . - for I had been
very poorly with a sadly depressing headache
ache which I seemed as if I could not
which I seemed as if I could not
get rid of at all - but I am now quite

recovered from it - & we are all comfortable
& happy for which I hast we are grateful
Ah! my dear Sarah this season recalls
many re-collections of our little festivities
in Ballitore at dear Fuller's Court, & when
the Quaternium used to kick up such a
fuss amongst us. - Ah! how many heads
are laid low since then & some of the dearest
& the best to us in this world! - What an
extraordinary revolution a few years bring
about! how different are our feelings &
thoughts & occupations now, to what they
were then. How changed has the scene become -
& how changed the actors too! - My
dearest sister such thoughts make me feel
the progress of years, even more than the
heavy step, the clouded eye & the silver
hairs! Richard told me of a fall thou got
in Sycamore Alley & gave me a great fright
I thank thou did not suffer more than
annoyance & alarm from it. - Yet I should
like to be sure of it. And so Philip is "as well
as ever" - long may he be so! & we all may
thank him for a few happy hours spent
together my dear brother & sister - I hope
Edward has quite forgiven me my crossness,
shall I promise that from the new year

out I shall try to grow good?. Alas it is all &
ever in vain if one puts off to another day
the reformation. (Do not blame me dear Sarah
for coaxing Sally to come to me. - I [underline]wanted[/underline]
[underline]her badly[/underline] & I do not think now I should
be as well as I am, which is perfectly so,
only she came. - Mind & body wanted
soothing & care but thank goodness it
is not so now & I am a different creature
& feel very happy. James & the children
are very well. - never were in better health
Please order for us two boxes of candles -
for the Kitchen & the bedrooms. - the bedroom
ones short - & the others 10 or more
to the [unclear]H[/unclear]. - & I shall
be obliged by your
directing them to
James Harvey Limerick & sending them
by boat as soon as they can. - We have
Cocoa nut candles we use in the parlour
yet in London & not near as good as
yours. - they neither fire as good light or
look handsomer - they are [underline]as[/underline] handsome
I think. I do not know their cost. Please not
to take any trouble in looking for the
Cachmere to match the belt. - as I have
taken now to wearing it as a house [unclear][/unclear]
dress, & under my cloak in town, for I
got some stain across the back breadth

which is through & through & cannot be taken
out - so I do not now care to make it
up fresh again; but if this [unclear]note[/unclear] comes too late
& thou hast got it - do not fret, but send it &
I shall manage with it still. it is a shame
for me to have left this [unclear]terrible[/unclear] on thee &
then change my mind, but it was the
stain changed it. I hope you have read
Oliver Twist, now published all together & by
far the [insertion]best[/insertion] book & most worth reading which has
come out this many a day in the way of a
novel. - It is a good & useful work & withal
touching & delightful. I am sure thy mother
would be delighted with it, please give her my
dear love. I may as well conclude Do
write soon to me - - it is very pleasant to get
& give her & Edwd. my dear love. & remember me to the rest
of the [unclear]family[/unclear]
[unclear][/unclear] Polly
[unclear][/unclear] & Charlie

Lydia. -
Dearest Sarah

Ever thy affte.
