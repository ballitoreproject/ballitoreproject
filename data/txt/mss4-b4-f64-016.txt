I hope thou wilt take the will for the deed for had I
better thou shouldst have it. We had a very agreeable
wedding, orderly yet pleasant I know not whether
thou likest to hear of dinners but I know my mother
does so shall mention ours. These were laid on
Stewed Rump of Beef
Palates, trussed fowl, Hare
Roasted Pig, Boiled tongue
Scotch Collops Turkey Ham
Pigeon & chicken pies
Saddle of Mutton
Vegetables -
Carrot & Buttermilk puddings
Mince Pies Apple Tarts
Torts, Jelly Blancmange
Spanish flummery Cheesecakes
Tartlets
the table properly but I
don't remember their order,
nor can I tell the supper
[unclear]Margt[/unclear] looked very pretty
she wore a very light bonnet,
light poplin gown, shoes to
match, white silk shawl &
white leather gloves - The
bridal train looked very
neat & sober going into meeting all the females
except two wore light poplins white silk shawls
& white leather gloves, shoes [underline]mostly [/underline]to match the
gowns & light bonnets. My uncle & aunt looked
very well & respectable, but I thought my uncle
seemed greatly troubled, most likely thinking
of poor Anne. Mary Watson was at meeting
& spoke beautifully first in testimony afterwards
in supplication - she looks but very delicate
& is not long recovered from a heavy sickness.
I saw R Allen in Waterford, he seemed very glad
to see me & enquired particularly after you all
he looks well & seems quite comfortable.
My aunt G. sits by me reading the bible aloud

but she desired me to go on with my letter.
Thos &
Margt are to leave us to morrow, also R. Strangman,
her son & daughter so we shall be very lonely; uncle &
aunt are to go as far as Anner Mills with them;[deletion][/deletion]
I have been striving to make up a packet for Margt to
bring to you, but find it a difficult task, this is my
5th letter to day, for know I did not go to meeting, so
had some spare time. Please ask my mother if she
have received Madock yet - I long to shew it to Sam
I send back Falconer's Shipwreck for which I am
obliged. I hope Jemmy will have an eye to my poor
little garden - I often think of it & my bower which
I left in full bloom. I cannot now write to Debh
tho' I intended it, for I am quite fatigued with
writing. Many were the enquiries for thee in Goughale,
Cork + Waterford, Mary Harvey (Reuben) spoke
with pleasure of the visit you paid together
at Summerville. I did not know who the Minnie
was before - she has a lovely family. I have
written until I am completely tired so will bid
thee dearly farewell. Thy letters were forwarded
immediately
thy affte niece
