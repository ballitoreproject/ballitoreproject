Clonmel 31 of 8th month 1791


My dear Father,


        I was favoured with thy kind letter giving account of your getting well home, which was very agreeable intelligence, we also got safe home, called on our way at James Daniels & dined with him, which was in some degree to my satisfaction after cloath [sic] was removed from the Table I ventured to express a few words by way of exhortation*, which was given before by the wisest Man, & which I thought arose with some little motion of life in my mind: the ensuing 5th day after our return we were favoured with Elizabeth Gelsons company, as also on first day, she was concerned in a close line amongst us, & especially to Men friends, she also desired an opportunity with the Members of select meeting, which she had, & counseled us to be careful & deep in chusing Members for that meeting, lest we should add to our burdens, she hoped Truth would point out who were qualified, if its directions were sought after, perhaps some young in years. We had also the company of our Lunster friends Hannah Wilson &c, she & her children & Niece favoured us with their company at tea, which was very agreeable to & desired by me, as ^an^ old particular family friend friend: thought not so wholly devoted to the use of the Church as could be wished, her attention being so taken up with trifles. Mary Dudley had them to breakfast, Mary has been laid up with pain in her jaw, she sometimes appears lively in our meetings, so that there is reason to hope her head is kept above the waters, I value highly thy remarks on the necessity of purity of heart, & believe but for the defilments many of us contract, we should be more fruitful to the praise of the great Husbandman, but for want of abiding constantly in the vine, we appear, & become like withered branches, which I often dread being my sorrowful case, & only for that mercy which endures for ever, believe it would be soAs to going on the remainder of the National visit if I could be excused it would be a relief to me, as I want much to get my own house in order, & if other friends go that were on the same appointment, & have moved but little in it, perhaps my going may be unnecessary, my little Robert is [paper torn] to live with care, but does require my steady attention, his Nurse is very ignorant, (Sally can tell) & others of the children have coughs, the chin-cough is very rife in the town, Sam is indeed a terrible child at running into accidents, he is whipt sometimes, but he seems to forget.
        I am concerned that the numness [sic] continues in my dear Mothers arm, are you intending to pay your visit to us? we are putting ourselves in some readiness for you, I have got a metal-oven set in the Kitchen which answers well also a boiler: & got a cellar adjoining the Kitchen from my Husband, in which I have set a very large pot, & am about to flag it, (if can readily get flags) for a wash house, have a large room above stairs over it for a laundry; we are also repairing our yard, & at this very time about a dirty job, emptying the ugly deep Well or recepticle [sic] for the foul water, as our sinks are conveyed into it, instead of running off into the street, tis said our ground ^is^ too low to easily effect this [paper torn] which is a grievance, & I wonder we are so [paper torn] as it cannot be wholesome. I have scribbled of these little matters for Mothers perusal as she bid me
Poor Widow Malone is come home, Molly Roberts spoke of thy company being a consolation to them. My Husband is gone to Waterford. My dear love joined by Abraham is to you all, & to Richard        Thy affectionate MGrubb
