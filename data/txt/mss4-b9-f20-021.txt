Elizabeth Leadbeater
Ballitore
2nd mo 1828
My dear E - Jem Murphy
brought the parcel safe
McDaniel also brought
the bag safe I had paid
the messenger a shilling
& dismiss'd her before
E open'd the letter or I
wd have another [unclear][/unclear] line
back by her Fanny was
here yesterday she would
rather be a boarder with
thee as the principal
reason for going to Ballitore
wd she to have society & particularly
thine as thou

art a favourite with
her she would not
go to thee for so little
as Â£40 per ann but did
not say what she would
give I think its best to
let her offer & if too
much thou canst
easily lesson it
Harriet will be kept in
town for months
Fanny is still too busy
to go, I think if thou
were to come to the
meeting thou could settle
all with them - as I do
not think Fanny will
move before that time
she is so [unclear]gourred[/unclear]
& low thy SB
For Sarah
