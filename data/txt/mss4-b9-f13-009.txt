Liverpool 5th of 6th month 1823 -
So here we are my dearest Sarah & what is more
with my kind friends the Rathbones - Deborah
has borne travelling so far very well; I intended
writing to thee about her before but we were so
completely & birds of passage that I could not
make time - having two gowns to make also
occupied me. We were delighted with Bangor
& the wild scenery of the Welsh mountains. We
visited Llangollen Vale & the retreat of the [underline]Friends[/underline]
I cannot now particularly describe it as I am
hurried greatly for the post, only to say that
a great deal is made of a little. for the place
is very small & it seems large with its wilderness
of walks. We left Bangor last evening
& staid on the sea all night & arrived here
this morning at 1/2 past 4 it was very
unpleasant but the Captain gave us his
room with two berths - one high above the
other into which I had to spring or swing
like a wild cat - We had an unpleasant
night - Eben went to Rathbone's office
& we were forced to come here by kindness
I did not at first like it, but they are so
& occupied the other

[underline]I wish[/underline] that I now do. The country round
here is so deplorably flat that I am moaning
after the mountains. We intended returning
tomorrow night to Dublin but I suppose
now we shall stay to the beginning of the
week. - This I do not like, for I had hoped
to begin my visiting at home, with you
next week - but as I gave myself to them
ie E &D, I will not interfere in their plans
I hope D will be much the better, She is already
improved, & was able to go to Llangollen
50 miles from Bangor [insertion]on the top of the coach[/insertion], walk about there &
return the next day - this is something - she
walked a good deal often, without feeling fatigue.
I am longing to be at home, but enough of this.
I have kept a slight sketch of our tour in
my pocket book which will tell thee more
She is now lying on the bed trying to sleep
she got so little last night.
Please give my love to Edward & Mary
Shackleton. I am sorry that I am from
Dublin & she in it - but I hope her visit
to Dublin will not prevent her returning [deletion]here[/deletion]

with me to Richmond. I suppose or rather
hope we shall leave this on second day & on
third day morning will see you all including
my dear wee niece. In this house there is
a child of a week old - but I have not yet seen
it. I am so hurried I scarcely know what
I write so I must bid thee adieu,
Ever my dear sister
thy affectionate
L J Fisher
Deborah is asleep so we can
not determine on what day
we have this but I think not until second
day. Deborah's dear love to thee E. & M.
I don't know when we go
