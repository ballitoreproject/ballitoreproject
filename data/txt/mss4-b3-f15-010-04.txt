Abby [Pim] is a fine, helpful plant - I have strong (& I hope well-founded) expectation of her becoming a stake in Zion, a pillar in the house. This must be a comfortable object of thy contemplation - I would be glad to be a minister of comfort to thee by any glad tidings, having frequent sympathy with thee.
