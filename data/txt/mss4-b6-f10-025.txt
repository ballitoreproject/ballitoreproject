Carlow 21 Mch 1812
My dear friend
I Rcd thy favor & Return thee thanks
for thy ready compliance with my proposal
if then thou dst execute the plan I intend it
shall not be known who was the author
any further than has already transpired
the [unclear]chance[/unclear]boy waiting he delivd the basket
& bag the bottles will be 2/4 a dozn I
apprehend but time not time to enquire
I know not whether the female has any
claim to beauty further than what is due
to all the sex - Our James appears better
he has got on a flannel waistcoat &
warm plaister between his shoulders wch
blistered him a good deal - we are all as
Sally left us & glad she get safe home
with her luggage - thine affly Sam Haughton
The papers announced Miss Long's marriage
