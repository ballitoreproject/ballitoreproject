My dear cousin,
        +++ Though our poor finite conceptions cannot comprehend this dealing of Infinite Wisdom with this seemingly innocent creature, A. T. yet doubtless it is right  & the good hand of Providence is singularly remarkable in ordering this poor things situation to be in a family, where so much cordial affection & friendship are shewn to her  as well as among such sympathizing friends. This revives in my mind an observation, which I have had cause frequently to make  that however deeply & variously we may be tried, yet some means of alleviation are cast up, some place of refuge is appointed; if we be bereaved of one comfort, another is left us; if we be reduced, we are not altogether destitute; though we put our mouths as in the dust, yet there is hope.  And certainly, by how much the nearer we cleave to the rock of All-sufficient help, by how much the more entirely we cast our cure upon him, by how much the closer we walk with his Spirit, & obey his commands in all things  in so much greater degree we shall become objects of his divine notice, favour & protection  as is said, Who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that which is good?  Be encouraged therefore, my beloved friend: lift up thy head above the waters  wait diligently [page number] 112 to know the Masters will; & when clearly seen, with all simplicity & fidelity perform it  so wilt thou walk in unity, in unison with the Spirit, & this thou wilt experience to be the bond, & seal of thy peace. We have many temptations to grapple with, while engaged in this warfare, in common with mankind in general  the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye & the pride of life  & those who have been chosen out of the world, & by a high & holy hand separated to services in the church of Christ, have their peculiar baits & snares laid for them by an insidious, assiduous adversary, who is still practising [sic] on their ^natural^ dispositions, or local, temporary habits, and accommodations of manners, in order to unfit, disqualify  or to impede the work going on in them  So that, Watch & pray (or Wait unto prayer) remains the standing, salutary precept for all, through all generations, lest we should enter into temptation  the spirit of the man, under the immediate operation of the Spirit of Truth, is willing; but the flesh, in which dwelleth no good thing, is weak  is in danger of declining to ease and indolence, & being carried down the stream of too general lukewarmness & indifference. This is a polluted rest, in which too many have settled  but (through the economy of a Gracious, all-wise Parent) this rest has been disturbed to some  they have seen it to be unsafe, unsanctified  & have forsaken it  May all such, who have been thus roused from a false rest to active labour, grow more & more in a capacity for service  they can never serve in a more noble cause  they can never be employed by a better Master

        While I was writing this letter I was gratified by some favours in this way from my friends in England. ++++ I understand there is a letter addressed to a friend Fox, who went to Paris, in order to refund some prize-money, which he had received during the war, & which had been a burden on ^to^ his mind  the letter is from Nismes in the province of Languedoc, written by one person on behalf of about an hundred, who call themselves Quakers  it appears (my correspondent says) in an agreeable style, though not quite what we are used to  as it was written in French, it may suffer by the translation  these people (I learn) are not exempt from military service, but they have some indulgence, & look forward with hope of further toleration  Thus there seems as if there was some stirring of Good in different nations  & the prospect of the principle of Truth spreading is pleasing & comfortable  ++++
        My dear friend & cousin Farewell
