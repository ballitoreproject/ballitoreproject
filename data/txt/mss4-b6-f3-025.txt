Lisburn 1 Mo-31st 1814
My dear Friend
I had written to thee the beginning of
this month enclosing some money for Anecdotes
and Dialogues sold, but in consequence of W. Bode's
son not going to Ballitore as he had intended, the
letter was returned to me last week - I now enclose
Â£1.3s.9d on account of the Anecdotes sold & 1s.3d for
one copy of the Dialogues. When S.S. returned to
Ballitore I sent Betsy Shackleton 5s more than I
had received for the books sold; I have since sold
Dialogues to that amount. I will thank thee to
receive the balance from her in order that the
account may be kept more accurately - I hope
Betsy & thee keep an account of the books sent
to me, & of the money I send you. I hope soon
to send thee another sum on account of the Anecdotes.
A bookseller in Belfast owes for some copies,
but he is unwilling to pay his debts.
I thank thee for the addition to two of
Betsy Shackleton's letters, & for thy kind inquiries
respecting the welfare of this family. My Father
frequently suffers much from the rheumatism, &

from a severe cough; but he seldom or never complains.
I hope when the weather becomes a little
milder, that his accustomed exercise in the open
air will contribute to mitigate the pain: The total
removal of the rheumatism he cannot expect,
nor does he make himself uneasy by repining
at unavoidable circumstances. Betsy's health has
been much better for some weeks past. I can
with pleasure assure thee that I never enjoyed
better health than I have done since I recovered
from my severe illness the beginning of last year.
I delight to contrast my feelings now with what
I felt then. But the freedom from pain does not
give me half as much pleasure, as the conciousness
that my Father has not now, in addition to
his own sufferings, to bear the constant anxiety
which he suffered about me.
We have had uncommonly severe
weather for some time past. This town, in consequence
of the depth of the snow, looked nearly deserted.
The only interruption to the stillness which reigned
in the streets for some days, was the tolling of the
bell for funerals. During a few days of thaw our
winter scenery was enlivened; & the town in some

degree resumed its usual appearance. My Father
with his usual attention to us, got a walk cut
through the snow, & Betsy & I take our accustomed
walk even in the severest weather.
I have sent a message to the lady who
wished for the first part of Cottage Dialogues, &
when I get an answer I will inform thee.
I hope M. Trench regularly receives the
Magazines. The sale of the Magazine continues
to increase in England as well as in Ireland.
In the next number thou will see a little poem
by T. Lamont entitled "Paddy's salutation [unclear][/unclear]
or shake of the hand". Her attention being [unclear][/unclear]
[unclear][/unclear] much occupied with her school prevents her
from exercising her poetic talent frequently. In
a letter to me lately she says, "If I ever had any
genius, it has perished by neglect during the
perpetual struggles I have been obliged to maintain
to ward off the approaches of poverty." She
has had to struggle with many distressing difficulties
& the death of her husband & only son, & [deletion]the[/deletion] consquently
the sole support of two daughters devolving
on her.
I had a long letter from my
valuable friend T. Houlbrooke about two weeks ago;
he is actively engaged in plans for promoting the

comfort of the poor, & especially that class of people
who deserve much commiseration, individuals who
have been educated in a genteel line of life, but
who, in consequence of untoward circumstances, have
been reduced to poverty - Rushton has not been
able to put his [deletion]?[/deletion] intention of returning to the country
into execution. He continues to possess the same
undaunted & intrepid firmness which adversity has
not been able to shake. I have not seen Maria
Edgeworth's last publication; but I have little doubt
of its merit, as she seldom disappoints the expectation
formed of her writings -
Please give my dear love to Betsy Shackleton, & tell
her I intend writing to her soon. With love to Elizabth & Deborah
I am thy sincerely affectionate S Hancock
