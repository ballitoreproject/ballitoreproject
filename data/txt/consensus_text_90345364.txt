It is ever so late now and no sign
of the boys -
[insertion]x[/insertion] 23[underline]rd[/underline],, Well! at about 1 1/2 - last night
Charlie made his appearance - and after
another half hour had elapsed Philip
followed with Georgina and Fanny
They had had a very merry evening,
dancing away till the last minute.
There were more than fifty I believe
and a great many they did not
know -. The famous Miss Plant and
her sister were there - the latter was dressed
all in green, so Charlie called her the grasshopp[unclear]er [/unclear]
greatly to Georgina and Fanny's amusement
Aunt Martha chaperoned five young
ladies - Georgina, Fanny, her two nieces
and Emily & Maria Rigby. After they
had arrived at the Waterfall the rain
came down and as there seemed
to be little chance of it clearing up, it
was resolved to put up all the dinner
P. P. (which had been partly laid out)
and just go back again to Sidney.
