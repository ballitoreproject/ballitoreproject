Ballitore: 7/8 month:1781.
My dear Cousin,
	I am favoured with thy Letter, often thought of writing to thee, but a variety of impediments prevented - I congratulate the new-married pair on their union - I hope there is cause to hope that he who made them has mercifully condescended to interfere with their connexion - that it is not without his Divine notice & approbation - They are young, tis the Spring-time of life with them - luxuriant shoots will be apt to grow - may they suffer the pruning hand of Divine culture, the baptism which initiates & preserves & keeps clean, & renders comely & acceptable in the sight of the husband of Souls - Acceptance with him is all - & without it every enjoyment fails of satisfying the immortal Spirit - every comfort of this life loses its best relish, & every trouble is aggravated by an additional sting - Whereas, dwelling low, keeping in the moderation, looking to our great Benefactor daily for his blessing, holding All as at his hand, & referring All to him, his benefits are received with humble thankfulness, he filleth our hearts with food & gladness, the Creatures are used to his honour, & are not abused to our hurt, & the Great Giver has the praise of all. Give my dear love to them both - as they are now one flesh, I hope they will be of one spirit, & that a right one - There does not seem to hang a doubt about me, but that they will do well every way. So be it.
	Upon the whole, my English tour was satisfactory - I was favoured with health & spirits - my friends seemed pleased to see me, & I was glad to see them - The Yearly Meeting was large, many of our acquaintance there, & among the rest Esther Tuke, to the renewal of our undecayed amity - her daughter Sally was there also, & in my opinion has a valuable gift in the ministry - But why should I be particular? - Hast those not seen Robert Dudley, & has not he told thee all about it, if Jo Richardson has not? By the by, Jo Richardson & I hit it very well - we met, travelled together & parted very good friends - he was kind & obliging - Chrissy Hustler was there - If I did not take pains enough to pay her for thy Spectacles: which was the Letter (& all I knew) of my commission, I wonder at it - I could very seldom see her - When I did: she told me that she owed thee money, said I really dont remember what about the spectacles - but on the whole, I know she neither gave me Spectacles, nor received money from me - Perhaps thou may have heard from her more satisfactorily some other way - The Yearly Meeting being I hope well over, James Lecky whom I expected for my companion, joined himself to Robert Watson & wife; & Joss Edmundson & I went for Manchester, taking Mary Brookes meeting in our way (with which great woman I had long conference about many things.) We also in our way, at one of the Stages (Longhborough [sic]) very early in the morning popped into a room in the inn, where to my astonishment I met William & Ether Tuke, Robert Dudley, & John Burgess - they were sitting in a religious opportunity, & disciplining a poor friend there, who had lost a good state & fallen into Intemperance, to his own hurt, the wounding of others, & the great damage (I suppose) of a plantation of convinced friends settled about that place. Esther renewed her pressing invitation to me to go to the Quarterly Meeting of York; but I told her I would not be put out of my way by any old prophet, left them & went to Leek, where Joss Edmundson & I spent an afternoon, had some of the agreeable company of Fanny Dodshon, lay at my old acquaintance Joss Strangmans, rose early next morning, & got to Meeting at Manchester about ten oclock (31 miles) shaved, shirted & breakfasted on the road. We spent a week at Manchester, Joss Edmundson having business there, which detained him - had some very agreeable seasons among our friends, lodged at John Rouths who lives near John Thorp, with whom, & John Rouths sister, dear Sally Taylor, I spent my time very agreeably. Matty Routh (whose name had been Winter) was also of our select society. John Thorp was very open to me in his communications - he appeared in testimony at that First meeting which we came to there - We went by water a good deal of the way from Manchester to Chester, proceeded thence to Holyhead, staid there a piece of the day & night, embarked early next morning, & landed in about 12 hours at Dublin - I staid there next day (being First-day), & the day following reached home, under a humbling, tender sense of Divine protection. Robert & Molly Watson went to Buxton, being recommended to those waters for a pain in their stomach (one heart, one stomach) - I am told that they found benefit, & are expected to return with James Lecky perhaps in 10 or 14 days. Sarah Pim of Tottenham had been very ill, but Infinite Wisdom saw meet to prolong her life - she appeared to me to have been brought down by her afflictions to the very Spring of true Consolation - her company was savory & edifying. Betsy Pim was rather delicate as to her health, did not get at all to the Yearly meeting, her mother requiring so close attendance, nor did her sister Hannah, who left London just before it, being obliged to bear David Barclays ^wife^ company to Tunbridge-wells, on account of the ^ill^ health of the latter - Hannah is a choice lass - I had some of her company - she is (I believe) very well pleased with her subordinate station - There is also a fine young girl, Abby Pim - Young John is in every respect I hope doing very well - I doubt William is too little of a Friend - Richard a School-boy - the Father the same man still - This is the English part of the family - Poor Sally Birkbeck (that was Hall) has been very ill in a Jaundice, went from the Quarterly Meeting of York to Harrowgate - the last accounts we had of her were unfavorable - Peggy Grubbs children have been in the Measles - her youngest had been dangerously ill - she was much alarmed about him - but I hope they are all now in a fair way to recovery, though the kindness of good Providence - Thy old neighbour Mary Watson, late wife of Samuel Watson, died at Lassgawan 30th ultimate of a bilious complaint - It was rather sudden - By accounts I think there is cause to hope she made a good end - I hope there rather a Reviving in that meeting, that some of the young folk will do well - Dear Sally Watson is of great use to the young couple at Ballydarton - her health but middling - Our dear love is to you all - For the rest, I refer to Mollys Letters, & am very affectionately thine
Richard Shackleton
