Ballitore ninth second month 1823
My dear Sarah
With weary fingers I turn, from
having copied Crabbe's long letter for John Bewley,
to thee to tell thee a great deal. - In the first
place I begin with what appears to me to be the greatest
news & the most acceptable for me to write & for thee
to hear - Deborah is better - recovering from a severe
attack of bile - her spirits are low - the weather &
my going so soon, account for this - but she is
down stairs - was down to breakfast this morning.
The next is a great secret which thou must tell
to no one - excepting Edward, always,- Thomas Fisher
The no-doctor & the all-usher has asked for [underline]Sarah[/underline]
Godlee!!! There ought to be no notes of admiration
after it then cannot be astonished - but the affair
[unclear]lays[/unclear] by until the Dr. has an establishment ready
for the lassie - he says himself he was accepted [underline]instantly[/underline]!
& he is thou may well suppose the happiest
of Drs of ushers & of [unclear]Dominics[/unclear] mind I do not say
of [underline]Fishers[/underline] - I had a letter from him the other day
telling me to tell thee of his happiness with his
Sarah's permission - this is pretty of S G. - I have

been his confidante this long time & I have been burning
to tell thee - I must extract some of his letter for
thee. "Wilt thou tell [underline]thy[/underline] Sarah that I shall be glad to receive
a reply to my letter & to be congratulated by her on my
happy prospects - [underline]My[/underline] Sarah has a very high opinion
of her." - Thou foresaw all this long ago. - Thomas was
a long time ill - 3 weeks nearly, confined to his bed &
room. - Theodore & he are very glad to have each other.
We were disappointed that Hannah Dawson did not
come yesterday - we expect her tomorrow & James & Sally
tomorrow night - poor James is but [underline]shyly[/underline] attended
by his relations owing to one body's sickness, another's
tender feelings - another's delicacy - another's untoward
circumstances - & so on - so that this said wedding
which was to have been great, - if not equal to that
of Bally-poreen, at least was to have rivalled "Paddy's
wedding O." has dwindled into nothing almost - for
my own part I am better pleased as it is.
Deborah would thank thee to send a bottle of nitrous acid
by Edward, who will not disappoint us I hope, she desires her
dear love to thee - my aunt Lydia who is better, would wish
thee to send her [insertion]word of[/insertion] the price of a pepper [unclear]castor[/unclear] with a silver
top, & Mary begs thou wilt buy her a box of charcoal tooth
powder. - We have all colds & dread the [unclear]persisting[/unclear] of next
5th day. - I hope thou art very well - why wilt thou not
write to me - I intend being a very good correspondent
from the West. - I don't know when George will present

Joseph Fisher is better. I leave thee now to go take
tea at the School - - I beg thou wilt enclose the
accompanying billet to Dick Webb. - it is about
a book which he must bring or send to me
for E Poole. James invites him to the wedding.
Here comes my mother from Debs.
Perhaps I may not have time to write after returning
from the School so I had best bid thee
farewell my dear sister. With dear love to
Edward & Eliza I am my dear dear Sarah
thy very affte.
LJL.
If thou can send this note to Dick Webb
the day thou gets this tomorrow it will oblige
me greatly. I hope to see John with Edward.
I leave this for my mother to add. I have a great deal
more to say if I had time. I directed this with a [unclear]swan's[/unclear]
quit.

My dear Sarah, Debh.. expects Edward & John, I believe RSL intends to take the
latter to himself - she begs he may bring her some nitrous acid. I have met with an agreeable
nurse, prepossessing in countenance & manner - a grand-daughter of Dennis Newton's whose child is
3 months old, who is not in a place of her own, her husband being engaged at a Mill - Mary Doyle
seems to know & to like her. She came to put in for thy nursing. I told her thou intended to nurse
but hold her disengaged from any other, till I see whether thou wilt be disappointed in that hope
as I was. If thou dost not want her, she will then be ready for Susan Doyle's friend - If thou dost
I have another ready for her so I hope we will settle it amicably. Adieu thy Mth.
