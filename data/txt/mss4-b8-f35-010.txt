Ballitore, 21st of 4 mo. 1826
Dear Edwd.
I would be obliged by thy Letting me know
whether, from the Lease herewith sent for thy inspection;
The Reprs. of Costiken are entitled to the profit rents
of the farm therein mentioned up to the 1st of next
month May, as the last life expired on the 28th
March last - I thot. that when the last life dropped
There was an end [deletion]there was an end[/deletion] to any advantage
for that 1/2 year unexpired at the time of the death
[unclear][/unclear] the last life in the Lease, some think other [unclear]wise[/unclear]
& that the Reprs. of Costiken are entitled to [unclear][/unclear]
profits till 1st May next, perhaps there is something
in the Lease that gives them that advantage
The Costikens were tenants to Richd. & Melesina Trench
I suppose some of Melesina's predecessors purchased
that Estate from the Lumm family - I expect to
be in Dublin at the time of the meeting, if my wife
be fit to leave at that time -
Thy assured frd.
