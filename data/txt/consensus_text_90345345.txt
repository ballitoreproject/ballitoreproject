and apparently well stacked with flowers,
looks rather out of place - From the
terrace there is a [deletion]fine[/deletion] lovely view of Antrim
Bay at the far side of which stretches along
for miles (I think) Lord May. domain
We could not stay very long, but saw
what was most worth looking at in the
time. Underneath the terrace are long
vaults which I should rather have
fancied exploring, had there been time.
When driving along the avenue T. H. pointed
out to us, here and there iron gratings
which he said, were to give light to a
subterranean passage leading from these
vaults to I really forget where - I think
to a burying ground. If I had not
been [deletion]wriding[/deletion] [insertion]riding[/insertion] I should have taken a
little sketch I think, however we cannot
have every good thing. It was past
seven when we returned. Mr. and Miss
Gilmore took tea with us, and we spent
a pleasant evening playing games.
