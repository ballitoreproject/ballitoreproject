Dublin: 31st of 1st month 1791.
Having just now heard of an opportunity home, though I sate down to,
& dated this sheet with intention to address it to our dear M: Pim, I thought
I would use it to acknowledge the receipt of my ever dear William's letter,
which came to my hand just when I longed for it, having been a little cast down
by reason of a dream, pity on my weakness, or, if thou please, blame it.—I I have been
often thoughtful since about my dear mother, & her increasing infirmities of
body & mind, which I have not endeavour to relieve as much as I might, &
intend when I return to lay myself out more to assist her, believing I might
do it, though sometimes it appears not easy to do it—I was rejoiced to have thee
say thou wert very well, & feel grateful for thy kind participation in
what gratifies me; nor do I at all judge by thy liberty thou grants me to
stay, that my company is less desired by thee than if thou urged my return.
I do enjoy I think "all the proposed pleasure of my visit," & would more I believe,
could I abide more in this sweet, quiet family; but friends are so very kind
in inviting, & one cannot refuse them, especially as most of them are dear
friends; so I intend by breakfasting with one, dining with another, &c, to manage
as well as I can. I breakfasted at Jane Irwin's this morning, & we are to drink tea at
Richard Pike's, for I reserve the beloved places for evening, when I can, one is then so
social & cozy at our work, & sometimes profitable as well as pleasant discourse.
However, my dear William, thou art I think the constant companion of my [insertion]mind,[/insertion]
& though often a tender regret at our separation attends, yet a secret pleasure &
perhaps pride attends also, [deletion]&[/deletion] when thou art enquired for, & my new names (for
[underline]Mary[/underline] is mostly now the [unclear]ton[/unclear]) are mentioned—but last evening how sweetly did the
idea rise, our union seemed sweetened by previous suffer[deletion]ed[/deletion][insertion]ing[/insertion] in the secret of my
soul I rejoiced, I hope humbly, & desired that I might be a true help-meet.

I am sorry my brother Henry should have so disagreeable a journey, & for his
& his patients disappointment; he might it is like have spent a day with us,
& have got home as soon. Does thou take thy Lanthorn to the Mill? I have thought
of it in these dark nights—Tell me when thou writes would thou like green silk
for a purse, or some graver colour? How is Molly Haughton & poor Dick?
Robert Clibborn desired I would inform my Father that Jas. Kathrens had
judgment entered upon [insertion]R: Eyres[/insertion] the bond, & that Robert has the Bond, & certificate of
judgment in his possession, & will deliver them to me if Father chooses, sends his
love, & says it was not laziness prevented his writing, but thought my writing
would do. If Sister Sally could be informed before she leaves Co: Carlow, that Cous
A: Pike desired enquiry might be made concerning the character & behaviour
of Rachel Lingwood servant to Rebecca Goff, I would wish to have it as soon
as might be. We have had a disagreeable affair here, which has afflicted me
a good deal, on my own account also, as I was the means of getting Tom Wilson
here, & he has been detected since I came in secreting money out of the shop,
with intent to elope—I was pleased however that he attempted not to cover his
crime by lying, & that it appeared more the act of folly than of premeditated
wickedness, however it does not seem safe to keep him—I have wrote
to his sister a full account, but believe they will wish not to have it spoke of,
therefore please keep it to thyself, unless thou chooses to mention it, as a secret
to Mother. For it pleases her to be made a confident of. I suppose dear Joseph Williams
has been much troubled that he should be the means of bringing such a blot upon
our feast of Charity as Matilda proved; he did not go to see her, but made
enquiry, & had reason to believe she was the kind of a person [unclear]thou[/unclear] supposed.
I did not hear him speak of her, having had little of his company, [insertion]he is engaged on the visit[/insertion] I dined there
7th day, drank tea at J: Stott's, sixth-day drank tea at Robt. Atkinson's, whose
wife so reminded me of her sister Jane Watson, as made me determine to write
to her by one of the ships which are about to sail soon. Fifth-day I dined at
T:

T: Fayle's East-street, came home to tea because Jno. Conran & M Stephens were
here, but Anne insists on an[unclear][/unclear]y instead. Con: Thos. Bewley came
home a little while ago, so I [unclear][/unclear] this family will soon be visited. Joseph
Williams appeared in testimony yesterday morning, the other meetings silent.
I met Paul Johnson to-day, who as usual looked down—after we had
past I turned my head to look after him, unluckily! for he had turned
his head too. Little Susanna sends her love to thee, [insertion]&[/insertion] she reckons she would
like to live with us; her innocent company increases the satisfaction to be
felt here—I wish to learn that quietude & cleverness which so beautifully
unite. I hope my dear mother will excuse my not addressing her at
this time—I endeavour to be pretty diligent at my work, writing & visiting,
that I may have something to shew when I go home. This family unites
with me in dear love to our's. Did Sally ride the Bay-mare? May I
expect thee to write soon again? Perhaps Jo Haughton might bring me
a line, but I will be satisfied I hope if it be not convenient to thee—
but always say how thou are, & sometimes bestow a thought on her, who
means not to be in the practice of rambling, but to endeavour to fulfill
the duties owed to thee, my dearest earthly beloved, from
thy affectionate [underline]wife[/underline]
Mary Leadbeater.
M Bewley got a letter to-day from Sally
from Carlow, which delighted her much
If there was opportunity, & convenient to thee to get them (they are in the
upper drawer of the little chest of drawers outside thy room door on the lobby) I
would be glad of my gloves lined with skin, as my hands are sometimes very cold.
As I wish to get that set of Gough's history which I have exchanged with R. Jackson
for other books, I would like also to have them sent to me, that I might settle
about them while here. I [unclear][/unclear] I expect this is to go by T: Johnson.
+ she desires thou may be told she is not so easy affronted as when thou [insertion]saw her[/insertion] last, & that thou need not speak to her
for ill behaviour now, as she thinks she don't want it.

D: Wilson desired I should pay the sums, her son acknowledged to have wronged his Master of, also some
matters owing [unclear][/unclear] - then I have got a cloke for Jenny Miles, & having yet some more things to get for myself,
I fear coming short of money before I return; therefore, for who can I apply to but my dear Husband, if thou
can spare me two guineas by some safe hand, I would be obliged to thee, but if no convenient way offers, be not
uneasy I can do without it very well I expect
T: Johnson disappointed me, but I am
promised a frank. Please tell Mother that
Parliament is like very soon to lay a [unclear]high[/unclear]
tax upon Whiskey; therefore had not
better send for what she wants soon, &
perhaps for a double quantity.
William Leadbeater
Ballitore.
