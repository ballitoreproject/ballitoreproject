My dear Elzth.
I recd thine last night
& am much obliged to thee
for all thy trouble thou
hast taken, about my sheets
I read by Deb who goes with
Mr Bonham to day 16/-
I think the Linen looks
very well,
My poor aunt Wright has
at length been released from
her sufferings, at about 10
o clock 5 day night she
quietly expired, I have not

seen any of the family
since, poor little Sally!
EG was too late to see her
living, I have not seen
her yet, excuse my
hurry I have very little
time ever thine SB
My dear love to M Doyle
she will be grieved to hear
of my poor aunt -
