My dear friend, on a shabby piece of paper, & with
every inability for writing, I essay a few words.
Thy kind letter was mine on the 13th. I think. I do
not deserve such epistles from thee- not that my
love diminishes - but the returns are so poor
by this time. I hope that your invalids
are convalescent - except dear Anne Doyle
whose situation forbids such an hope.
My dear love is to her, her kind sister
& all my Ballitore friends, to our dear
Aunt. I refer there for every information
persons & things, for my poor head is
sadly out of order, & strange to tell we
do not seem qualified, to file the dates
of our valued Aunt E. Pike's testimony
perhaps when thee & my Aunt M. G are
together you can regulate that part - did
I send thee two printed papers on benevolent
subjects - lately received from London?
I am not mistress of any others of the kind
the bottles thou wilt think the very [unclear]couleur[/unclear]
the bottles thou will think me very careless
to send without directions. but they were dispatched
in haste. I trusted to thy prudence. I hope

my dear Lydia will send the account of
Ballitore with the other papers - now my
dear, kind friend farewell

I return thy dear Sister Chandlee letters
& if she inclines to trust me with more
they will be prized & carefully
returned I expect
my old friend E. Shackleton I love dearly
