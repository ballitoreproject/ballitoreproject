27 Wednesday. Fine, calm, and cloudy.
We have an empty house to day
compared to latterly - for Isabel
has flown, and Papa, Mama, Dick
and Nan, left this morning for
town on their way to Orange Hill
where they are going to spend a
few days - We expect them back
on Saturday. Poor Bell and
Victoria seem to miss them very
much, and were crying after dinner
when they found no Mama and
no Dick and Nan. They had
colds and that night have increased
their uneasiness.
28 Thursday. Margt. and Selina
drove over this morning to see Grandmamma
who has not been very
well since Sunday. She was
better tho' still confined to bed.
Aunt Eliza and Aunt Martha
were both with her
were both with her.

This was a fine day but cloudy
and gloomy.
