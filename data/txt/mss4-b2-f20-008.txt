Dear Friend,
	Having mentioned to thee that I did not know but I would ^should^ take the liberty of writing a few lines to thee on a subject, which there was not then time to discuss, and thou having repeated thy desire that I should, ^would^ I attempt it (I think I may truly say) in humility, in diffidence, & in a consciousness of my own comparative weakness & inferiority  We were speaking about thy not having had a certificate to the meeting of discipline at  & consequently not being regularly a member of it  In my opinion, several inconveniencies and confusion attend such a situation, & it is incompatible with the good order of society  a precedent of dangerous tendency [remainder of the sentence is struck through and illegible]-- A friend thus circumstanced may hold himself loose & disengaged  may think he may attend the meeting of discipline, or not, as it suits his convenience and inclination  and when he does attend, may excuse himself from meddling with any part of the business which he does not like to touch, as not being authenticated a member of the meeting  This I apprehend to be a great hurt to the party, as well as loss to Society-- Those who wish well to the cause, should wish to be both qualified & authorized to support it in their several lots & degrees  It is a cause which admits of no neutral professors  The head of the Church expressly declares He that is not with me, is against me: & he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad. And indeed, my friend, as the cause is the most noble that was ever introduced upon earth, being no less than the cause of Christ, and the salvation of the souls of all men, whoever shall ^will^ become qualified rightly to support it, must be made willing to stoop exceedingly low  they must pass through many baptisms, and undergo various operations & dispensations, before they become fit to be honoured with a portion of the Lords service which dignifies beyond all human honours, and is rewarded with eternal glory  Our great Pattern, when he ^graciously^ condescended to leave the bosom of his Father, to descend to this earth, & take our own nature upon him, left us an example how we should demean ourselves in fulfilling our duties in the church  In the article of washing the feet of the disciples, which I think bears a strong analogy to the transacting of the discipline, (being cleansed by Christ, and cleansing the feet, i.e. the goings of one another)  he did not go about it in an ordinary, cursory, light, indifferent manner  he addressed himself to the business officially as a servant  He riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments, & took a towel, and girded himself. After that he poureth water into a basin, and began to wash the disciples feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded. And to this memorable example replete with instruction he adds this instructive document, Ye call me Master and Lord, and ye say well; for so I am. If I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet, ye also ought to wash one anothers feet; for I have given you an example; that ye should do as I have done to you.  And as one that knew how absolutely, how essentially necessary a thorough humiliation of self was to a right qualification, he makes use of his strongest asservation to impress it on our minds. Verily, verily I say unto you: the servant is not greater than his Lord; neither he that is sent, greater than he that sent him. I have no doubt, dear friend, of thy attachment to the welfare of the religious society, of which thou art a member  & if thou hast followed on to know the Lord in all his manifestations to thee  if thou hast been faithful to the discoveries of this will in all things  if he has the uppermost room in thy heart  and thou art dedicated to him in all thy faculties, no doubt but our poor Society will reap the benefit of the good fruits brought forth  thy life will be happy and honourable  and thy end (if thou perserverest to the end) will be Peace. But if there be a consciousness that something is still lacking--that notwithstanding the filling up the moral duties of life with a good degree of propriety  there has not been a selling all in the will and affections  a distributing to those who are poor in religious poverty  and a following of Christ in the way and manner of his leadings  in the path of the cross and self-denial  let us remember that time, and what we may term, more convenient seasons, are not at our command  that the consummation of all things approaches with inconceivable rapidity, and for ought we know may be just at the door  that there is no work, nor device in the long repose of the grave  and that an irreversible decree seals all up for ever +++


I am, with sincere attachment, & good wishes
Thy affectionate friend
Richard Shackleton
