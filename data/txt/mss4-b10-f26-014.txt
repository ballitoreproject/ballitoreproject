March 26th 1847
I began my packet for home the day before yesterday my dear Mother but did
not send it still hoping to have a letter to acknowledge but not one has arrived
yet - but Thos. says if you did not write for a week after we left you we could not
have the letter yet so I must be patient a little longer - I told you in a former letter
that we left some of our muffling behind us at one of the towns at which we changed
horses when porting from Cologne to Hanover but I did not tell you all our fears
about it nor how much [insertion]it[/insertion] was in danger - Thos. fur coat & large wrapper apron and
my fur cloak & a cape of Bessies were all wrapped together in our parcel and with
our other luggage (as we had besides a fur cloak of Bessies a coat of Thos. and Mr Goldener
had a very thick fur [deletion]cloa[/deletion] coat & Mr Henry a horse cloth which with four persons in
the port carriages was quite enough) and some where during the journey this
parcel was either left at the port house or in the carriage while we were leaving, I do
not know which, it was in the dead of night and when the time came to change horses
all perhaps were sleeping or dozing - however both Thos. & Mr Goldener were on the watch
every time but the one to see that all was right - I did not mind about it as Mr Goldener
told me the postillions were accountable for every thing and in one of his own carpet
bags he had a set of Pearls worth five thousand pounds sterling which was running the
same [unclear]rest[/unclear] as any of the rest of the luggage - When we missed the parcel Mr Goldener
made the post master write back about it - Thos. giving his card
and address in Dresden that it might be sent after us - day after day
elapsed and we had no tidings of it and we began to fear [insertion]it was stolen[/insertion] that we really
should lose it altogether but had resolved to make another effort for its recovery
by writing to the postmasters along the line we travelled and were only waiting
for the arrival of Mr Evans' interpreter to do so when the postman called here
with the card of direction Thos. had given at the port house & saying if we sent to the Post Office
in Dresden we should get our parcel - this was good news, indeed - and we got it quite safe
without even the appearance of its having been opened and cost nothing for the coming
all the way - nothing in fact but about a shilling to the porter for a drosky - Thos. valued the
parcel at about £12 so that it would have been very annoying to have lost it - We have
happened on a dull time in Dresden the picture Gallery is closed and almost every thing
else worth seeing also on account of its being in Lent - & they will not be open except by paying
pretty dearly for them until after Easter - neither is the opera or theatre worth going to at this
season - the Seventh of next month is I believe fixed on for the wedding and I suppose
we shall not lose much time after than until we are on our way home but what way
we are to go I do not yet know - Thos. & Mary speak of Hamburgh as the latter wishes to call to see
Amanda Kreiplin - every way is equally new to me so I do not much care - [deletion]and[/deletion] Thos. thinks the
common route of tourists is so easily got at in comparison of the north & north east of Germany
that he seems more inclined to go home by Berlin & Hamburgh than the other way and speaks
of a little detour [deletion]through[/deletion] [insertion]into[/insertion] Bohemia - We spent last evening at James' and met there
some friends they have made here Mr Wagner is rumored the best Latin Scholar in Europe
and James & he are consequently very intimate - he is at present ill & not able to go out, but his
wife two daughters & son were at tea last evening - none of them speak English except the eldest daughter
& she speaks it perfectly well and with a very nice lady-like accent - the other daughter speaks French

but not english and the son speaks latin - Mrs Wagner nothing but German & several of us nothing but
English - notwithstanding all these disadvantages & advantages there was plenty of talk and noise I could
not help being amused at the whole scene - and the evening passed off very well; it is the custom here
to introduce at or immediately after tea sliced ham or tongue and cheese &c - which is handed round just
like the cakes & every one takes or not just as they like - but neither these nor the bread & butter or cakes
are removed at all the cloth (which table cloths) is left on the table and all these things on it & every
one takes whatever & as often as they like during the whole evening - there was no drink of any kind
introduced but tea and coffee - we broke up a little before ten oclock and Bessie & Mary & I came home
in a drosky Thos. & Mr Evans walked - This morning Ann Jane & Katharine paid us a visit and after
they went away Thos. Bessie Mary & I went into town as T&M wanted to go to the Bankers - we dine soon after
one oclock so that hurries us a little - but we generally go out again after dinner until tea time -
I would greatly prefer lodging at this Hotel tho' an inferior one to being in the town wh is close & disagreeable
I think and the smell continually assailing your nose [deletion][/deletion] so disagreeable [insertion]even now[/insertion] - in Summer it must be dreadful.
Mr Evans was out all morning visiting some of the high folk through whom he expects to get a room rent free
for the exhibition of the model - Captain Siborne having interest at court & the King having apartments at his disposal for
public exhibitions - but all is not arranged about it yet - The lower class of people here dress & look much more
comfortable than with us all are tidy & warmly clothed we saw no person like our beggars at all tho' we have been
asked for alms - the women work very hard carry large burdens and you see them constantly in the streets helping
the men to saw & carry wood wh is the chief fuel here - Dogs also are much in use one or two yoked together under
a light cart draw very considerable weights - and look quite lively & happy looking - and must be a great
help to the poorer people - the long bodied Carts or Waggons [insertion]with 4 wheels[/insertion] they use here drawn by 2 - 4 - 6 - 8 &c sometimes 10
horses are very picturesque - the horses seldom or never have winkers - and their collars are much larger
than those worn in Ireland and rise higher than their heads and are mostly ornamented with a scarlet shawl
or scarf hanging from the top down the neck of the horse wh has quite a gay effect - we had beautiful cloudless

weather for the first week we were here these past few days are dull & cloudy and what we call at home
[unclear]rain[/unclear] days - yesterday we had hail & rain to day is dry but cold & cloudy - Every day since we left
home we had excellent potatoe's - I did not care much what they gave us besides - today they were cooked
in a way I could not eat them tho' all th rest said they were very good - Thos. makes great fun
of me about the cookery & queer dishes - but I get on very well for all that - I wish I knew
how you all were at home & then I should think little about what I get to eat or drink.
I shall post this today as I think you will be waiting to hear about us and I shall write again
as soon as I receive a letter from home be sure, give my dear love to every one of the [underline]dear ones[/underline]
and let Lucy & Martha see this or any one that would care enough about us to take the
trouble of reading it. - If you write by the post which leaves Ireland on the fifth or sixth
of April which I hope you will do without fail - you may direct here according to the
direction we left with you - and then write again in 3 or 4 days afterwards and direct
and I expect we will get it on our way home
besure give my love to Edwd. Margt. & Dickey -
I consider I am writing this to Elizth when
I write it to you - my dear Mother your
affectionate daughter EH
Thos. joins me in
all the love [underline]heartily[/underline]
