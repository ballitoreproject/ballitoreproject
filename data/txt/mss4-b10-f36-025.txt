Dunlavin First day
My Dear Eliza
I think bad of the fright thee got, I wish I was
at home, I would go now only Frank & Lucy wd
think bad of my going untill he comes back from
Dublin he intends going tomorrow, I intend this to
go by him whatever day he returns I wish Morris
to be sent also, I suppose it will be on fourth day -
Morris will have to bring the collar & traces of our
harness also the [unclear]saving[/unclear] collar as the Collar of Franks
harness is to small & has hurt her neck, if it was
in town on thirdday morning & all [unclear]sap'd[/unclear] up right
morton could bring it [insertion]here[/insertion] if not, let morris carry
it himself give him 2s and he can get in the caravans
to Killcullen & he may walk from that here, you may
expect us home the first fine day after he comes
My mother is so sleepy that she is gone
to bed & bids me sign this for her

My dear Eliza
We have just returned from a jaunt to
the Glen where we were to day & got a perishing
the day was gloomy & cold, we fixed to go there
this morning as F & L could not both come conveniently
any other time. the weather is almost
like winter, indeed summer seems gone entirely.
This morning we got thy letter, it is pleasant to
hear that you are all well, I hope thou wilt not
be worse for the fright, it was well it was not
worse if thou had been knocked off it might
have been serious. I hope we will soon see thee
now, my Mother has told thee of our plan of going
home, we intended going early in the week but
Frank is going to town tomorrow, (which he did
not tell us till yesterday) & my mother does not
 like to leave Lucy while he is away, I will not
be sorry to get home, we seem a long time away.
[unclear]Maurice[/unclear] must bring or send down the Collar
& saving collar, as Frank's has hurt the mare's
shoulder being too small, the traces I dont know
how he will manage but sure they would
not be much greater bulk. I hope we may have
a fine day for going & that we may find all

well when we get home. I cant but think of what
a polite man that was who got into the Gig & left thee
on the road, but it is just like them, and we need
not wonder at it. On sixth day last Lucy & I went
to Ballitore, as L wanted to do some shopping at
A Wrights, we stopped for a short time at Cousin Betty's,
who had not returned from town but there
was a very good substitute in Elizth it was so late
when we got there that we had not time to go to see
E Gough which I was sorry we could not do as it is
scarcely likely we will be there again ere we leave this.
I got her crockery ware & we came home as fast
as we could having kept them waiting dinner
1/2 an hour. the day was gloomy & very windy.
seventh day that is yesterday was beautiful
& fine, my mother Lucy & I set off to Stratford
Saunders Grove & towards Baltinglass but not into
the town, it was a very handsome drive going
much more so than when we turned to come
home a different road. I think I have told thee
all we did since I wrote last, I do not expect
to have any more to tell now till we return
as while F is away it is scarcely likely we shall
go out. the children here are finely & after their
best fashion. Lucy has got Catherine back again which
is a great comfort, she seems a very agreeable servant &
always at work. I have often thought that if going

from home did no other good, it sometimes had
the effect of making people better satisfied with
their own & glad to get back to it again I do not
mean by that to say any thing to the disadvantage
of F & L for they have both done their best to make
it agreeable to us, & it has been so except that the
weather has been against us, this evening looks
very like wet, I hope Frank may be in town time
enough tomorrow to put this in the post as he is to
take it. with love to M & A & thyself I am thy affc Sister
 Selina

Lucy sends her love
