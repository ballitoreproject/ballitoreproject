Dear Friend
Joseph [unclear]Somey[/unclear]
(this favd' of the 2nd Inst. I Receved & may Say that to
me Jt. was & is very Exceptable, and the more so
as it contains Exclu[unclear][/unclear] of the Seasonable Simpathy which many
Times I have on my part felt) Accounts which to me is Indeede
glad Tidings, as I Cannot But Look upon the Visit of Each Laibour
Sent Amounghts us as afresh Visitation. & renewed Signale of
Almighty Goodness; yet Continewing to Set before us an
Open Door, alas Saith my Spirit., A that this poor unwort[insertion]hy[/insertion]
Nation would Enough Say it to Hart Are the Day of
Love become a Day of Chastisement; & that which was Spoken
of, that highty Favoured people be verrified in Us
you Have [unclear][/unclear] above all others Loved & you will I Finnish
&c
I am hartly Glad to hear of Samuel Neales progress in
the Celestial base, & Ardently wishes his Stidey perseverance
to the End thereof. which I Hope for and Doubt not oft. yet
Experience teacheth Daily, the Necessaty there is. of often bowing
to the Eternall root & spring of Life, without which there is
Great Danger of Shooting into wrong Growths which tends to
Dwarf the Plank of renown, Please remember, my Love to him
As for poor me as a sparrow upon a house top I seem to be
Here Stationed; Daily obsrving the maney wrongs & Evils that
Has overtaken a Sosiaty once beutifull through the faithfulness of
Its members; But now almost R[insertion]e[/insertion]prochfull through the falling away
of many, who would be Counted the Children of Wisdom, yet
alas folly Sits Cheif & presides over their ways
Dear Joseph I am persweaded thou Dos not think oftenar of
me than I Do of thee which Indeede thou need not be oblidged
to me for, as the greatest of what I term Conversation with friends
Is with those who are many miles Distance from me, when I
Remember with much sweetness nearness & Simpithy, Ever
Desireing to be one with Sions afflicted mourners, may their
Lots be my Lot & theire affliction mine, for Alass who that, has
an Eye & an Ear, to see & hear, & ahart to feele the wound which the body
Has recevid I Say who can for beare to weepe for the Slaine in Sion;
Come Dear friend Mourn with me, & omay the Eternall god Increase
the mourners in Sion [unclear][/unclear] and bring mourning on the [unclear]Baestiders[/unclear]
that they may Look on him whome they have desired is the ardent
Desire of one who Longs to see a time or revivall & restoration
and am thy faithfull Friend Thomas Greer
