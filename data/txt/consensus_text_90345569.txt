14th.. Friday - Again we were up
pretty early that is in time to
take a walk before breakfast and
as the day was fine went out pretty
soon after it. While waiting for Ned
in the dining room who should come
in but - - and we had a
little conversation but [underline]not[/underline] very long
then I found Ned and off we
set on our lonely way (met -) [deletion][/deletion] [insertion]up[/insertion] the
river and off beyond the two
mills - On our return I sat
awhile in the drawing with Hannah
Pim and as we were chatting at
the fire were joined by little Alice
Matterson a very nice little girl - and
rather unique in her way -
Mr.. Lyons came in to write letters
at the same time.
Alice played a little on the piano
for me and we afterwards strolled
out together and she showed me
about the some parts of the
place, which I had not seen
