Every fresh instance I experience of thy Friendship,
my dear Cousin, gives me to know how highly
I ought to value it - I consider this last as an
additional mark of affection that in the midst
of thy trying distress thou could increase thy pangs
by communicating the doleful tidings of my dear
Uncles sickness & disease - The warning he received
was very short - but yet it is no slender
consolation to reflect that he was always prepared
for the awful change - I was greatly shocked
when the news reached my ears (which was I
suppose after his dear remains were laid in
the earth) particularly as I had seen him such
a short time before in good health & spirits.
How transitory is our state! Happy they who
can make good use of their time in this world.
Thou
Wm. Rayner

Thou wishes me to go to the country - at present
I find it scarcely practicable - nothing except a
case of absolute necessity could authorize my leaving
Waterford in the situation of my employers affairs.
My appearance among you could I am convinced
contribute nothing to your consolation - if it
could I should readily go - My heart aches
for my dear Aunt to be deprived of her
companion & indeed for you all - I trust you
will not want a comforter to mitigate your
grief - but nature must have its course - the
loss is severe of which the sufferers are deeply
sensible Present my dear love to my Aunt
& each member of the families I believe my
dear Mary
I intend when the weather & my time permits to go over the
write & communicate to[unclear] M.[/unclear] Whelan what thou desires
water & communicate to M. Whelan what thou desires
Waterford Ninthmonth 3rd 1792
affectionately thine
William Rayner
