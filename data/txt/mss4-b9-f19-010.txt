Ballitore 15th of 9th mo [unclear]1810[/unclear]
I cannot express how rejoiced I was
when I received my dear sisters letter
indeed when I first opened it I could
not think it was all for me but how
happily disappointed was I when I
read the whole. I am greatly charmed
with thy fine description & almost
envy thee thy lovely scenery & sloping
banks I have not seen our famous
[unclear]Pen[/unclear] master since he came home
but I hope I will see him before
he goes back & would like to write
by him but if thou be in Cork
how wilt thou get the letter? I told
our friend [unclear]Firconnachley[/unclear] that [insertion]others[/insertion] inquire
after him & desired to be remembered
to him for which he was much
obliged Thou art very just in
H & M Davis send their dear love to
the & divers other that I cannot rember
but thou may take it for granted that
we all love the dearly thou cannot
long to see us more than we do to see
thee we have a great number of men
& churn very often but our churning
only does these two males or three at
the most Betsy was here to day I sent
her love to thee we like S White very
well but I fear we shall soon lose
her our clock is regulated & strikes
I drank tea at T Bewleys with H
Lefanu & Mary I spent a very pleasant
evening how is George? give my love to him
ever thine SL

not thinking I [deletion]refused[/deletion] accused thee
of indifference for indeed it was
the farthest from my thoughts
I will now tell thee all the news of
Ballitore in the first place, we have
got no less than a comb maker
who I believe thou heard of before,
a hatter & a watch maker - & a show
man with two women one of whom
is since married to the hatter the
other his own wife Susan Murphy
was obliged to give out her child
to be nursed [deletion]as[/deletion] I think the school
goes on very well Jane Williams
is to go to Athy to day & Mary
Davis & Jane to attend instead of
her we have had a great deal Military
in town among which was
a Black the finest man I think
I ever saw he was billeted on Isaac
My mother desired me to tell thee
that Jack Scamode [deletion]was[/deletion] [insertion]came[/insertion] there in
1765 but she does not rem[insertion]em[/insertion]ber him
but heard talk of him
Wilt thou excuse this very bad
writing but I intend to improve

Williams & gave them a history
of himself which was very interesting
& entertaining. Mary E
is expected home this week . . we
hear that Bess is married & are
almost ready to believe it. The
School boys have a news paper
which they send to the Subscribers
three times a week the subscription
[unclear]pins[/unclear] a week Betsy is [unclear][/unclear]
a great deal for it & we have in [unclear][/unclear]
all the news of the 'town' Jane Montgomery
came to see us & to take away
Harriet but we prevail'd on her
to leave her a little longer - I fear
we shall loose our dear D very
soon there is a party going to
Poulaphouca some time this
week to show it S White & if
I dont go I am to be with M.t S
My dear Elizth. Having got a [unclear]frank[/unclear] we use it, & Eben thought to write to
George but I believe will go to Carlow from Athy & write from thence. Poor
brother Chandlee very weakly. My Aunt a pattern I think of patience & every
amiable feeling, what a pity that sometimes a cloud shades their lustre. What a
lesson to endeavour to help to subdue a warm temper! I wrote 1st.. day night (& Eben
sent an order for Â£ 7..0..0. I hope thou got that & the [unclear][/unclear], which tell Richard
Grubb with my dear love that I beg he will charge to thee. Had I known there was
a difficulty in passing them I should not have sent it. Dear love to all
affty thine, ML.

fixing up D's house & they are all
to come to it from Poula Phouca
and drink tea there & leave poor
D there I think it is the best way
they could do & we are to have
things in great order for them
I was not a little stun'd when I
read in thy letter about thy carnations
& that thou would not see them
this year but I was willing to think
the best so left it that they would
be [deletion]home[/deletion] out of blow by thy return
