miles. 28th.. Two miles to meeting to Tyddynygareg,
after which 12 miles to Llwyn d√ª, to our
guide's (Henry Owen's) house, where we lodged:
we travel'd some road very bad indeed, & rode
on horseback a little towards the end: after
the fatigue of the day I found it very refreshing
to take a dip in the sea, which comes near
to this house. 29th.. First-day: meeting held in
H: Owen's parlour, S:T wished their neighbours
to be invited, here as well as at Dolgalley, a
few came, but the thoughts of their not
understanding the English language, wch.. few
of the [underline]friends[/underline] here do, [underline]was[/underline] [deletion]very[/deletion] discouraging
to my poor mind, which I feel very weak
in the best sense, even amongst the most encouraging
[underline]outward[/underline] circumstances, [underline]as witness[/underline]
with my dear D:D at Welch-pool. After dinner
came, 19 miles to Machynlleth. Griffith
