Georgina comes - Hallow e'en - - - -
30th.. Polly, Margt, and Papa all went
to town this morning, Mama brought
Georgina back in the car, as we had
previously invited her. This was a
very windy and showery day. Georgina
and I only went out a little after dinner.
While I write now - Georgina & Polly
(for she has just come out with Papa
it being past nine O'clock.) are chatting
opposite me, Philip writing, Avy sitting
thinking I suppose, Papa reading
on the sofa, and I writing this.
I must go and chat too so goodnight
to my journal - To-morrow will be Hallow
E'en. We invited Grandmama but she
is not coming nor our Uncles either.
T H is to be up to morrow -
31st.. Halloween E'en -. After breakfast
Polly, Georgina and I sat working and
chatting till about twelve, when the car
was ordered, and the filly too for I was
October -
