5th mo 1820
Was it by way of a gentle reproof my dear Elizabeth that that
thou did not mention my name from beginning to ending
of thy letter, I take it as such however knowing I richly
deserve it for not writing while in Dublin. I went to T Foyles
2nd day morning after the meeting fully expecting to see
Rebecca Strangman & charged with messages to thee
but to my great disappointment She had set off that very
morning, I did not see any of the Stephens's except
Thos who was very well & gave a good account of his mother
& sisters but his father is in a very poor state of health
altho' better just now than he has been for a long time
I expected Jane would have attended the yearly meeting
I lodged at John Wrights & nothing could be kinder than
Rachel I was very ill for 3 days after I got to Dublin
& poor Rachel had all the trouble of making gruel
& attending on me as if I was a duchess I might say I had
to breakfast in bed one morning they had 6 lodgers
Thos Wright & his wife Joseph Haughton Isras Satchell
& my father & self, so thou may think Rachel
had her hands full & rather an indifferent servant
but every thing was done very quietly and I was sorry
I could be to no use to her, Sam is quite attentive
assisting his father in the shop when not in School this puts
me in mind of Jos Abele of whom I saw very little
his school goes on well, one brings an other to my mind
I was at J Whittons [unclear]&c[/unclear] bread shop I supp'd a good
while on the counter & at length John came out
with his mouth full I believe he was eating his breakfast
in a little room behind the shop he was greatly surprised
to see me there & wanted to go in, but I was in a hurry

I went with a message from George to him he was Gs
right hand man while the meeting lasted I was very
badly off for want of a pen in Dublin this may in part excuse
me but if I had written there I could have told thee
more news, Ah I hope thou wilt go for a little while
to Wm Dawson's that beautiful country & that family
longing to to have thee, Oh Edwd Alexander Edwd Alexander!!
I hardly saw his shadow in Dublin. Poor Jane was
buried yesterday week - Robert Thomas still alive
we suppose, I spent one evening or part of an evening
at Claremont They are very happy there but expect
no encrease in their family untill the 10th mo
thy SL
