My dear Elizth
I hope I have not
kept your book too long - had I known
of an opportunity that I thought safe
you should have had it before - I now
send it by M Doyle - and thank
you for the loan of it - I read it years
ago but had forgotten half its beauties -
Campbell's is a finished style
nothing that would make us believe
he sent his productions forth in a
hurry - yet there are passages very
obscure -
I have [underline]our niece[/underline], sweet May
under my care in her parents' absence,

she is becoming every day
more interesting - but M Doyle
who paid us a visit yesterday and
saw her, can tell you how good
she is - I suppose you have
heard often from E&D. - I hope the
latter sends good accounts of herself
I heard nothing directly from them
since Sarah went - we are
very lonesome without my
Mother - but I am rejoiced that
she should have so much recreation -
indeed I think it will
do the whole trio good -
I had a very agreeable letter
from E Gough lately - she writes
in very good spirits - and spoke
with pleasure of her week's visit
to your valley - I gave my
brother John a letter to forward
to her from me but opportunities
to Carlow are not often known
to us, if he send it to you
will you be so kind as to
forward it for me -
with kind love to your
mother, I remain yours
truly
