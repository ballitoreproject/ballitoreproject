6[underline]th[/underline] We breakfasted very early this morning
as Papa wanted to be in town early
so he , [unclear]took[/unclear] Richard, Mama, and
Liddy went to town in the carriage.
The day continued so wet and
gloomy we did not venture out
till after five O'clock when we took
a little stroll down the avenue.
Poor Philip is not well to day , but I
hope it wont signify.
7[underline]th[/underline] This is very gloomy weather , damp
rain and cold - Philip is a little
better but not well yet. I am afraid
Georgina finds it stupid enough
out here, for we have but little
amusement for her - Papas & [unclear]Mam[/unclear]
came out this evening, Liddy
having staid in town with Margt
Papa told us of a frightful railway
accident which happened not very
far from Salens - 14 lives lost. I believe
and a great many injured.
One train ran into another
