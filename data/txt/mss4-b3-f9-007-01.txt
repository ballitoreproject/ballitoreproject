From the same to the same

Dear Cousin,

	+++ I suppose ye have had our friend C with you. I think so far he seems to shape well, & I am apt to believe (if he keeps on the right bottom) will shine bright before he leaves us. But a danger attends the poor servant often at his return home: to be stripped of the royal Priestly ornaments, & be reduced to the old ordinary clothing: to be deprived of the capacity & strength occasionally furnished, & to feel ones self weak as other men, are circumstances trying to the create. Hence I fear there has has sometimes proceeded an impatience & restlessness, a desire to be up & be doing, & perhaps a temptation has entered of endeavouring to gain or preserve the preserve the good opinion of the people, by sacrificing before the Prophet come: I forced myself, said Saul, & offered a burnt-offering. May all ranks & degrees of us be preserved in humility & nothingness of self; for if we do not thus take root downwards, we shall be so far from experiencing that permanent growth, which in due season may cause us to bear fruit that we shall not be likely to hold out against these manifold impediments & annoyances with which we may expect to be tried, & our stability proved! ++++
	Thine affectionately
		Richard Shackleton
