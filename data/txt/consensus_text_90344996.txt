I think - Margt spent the evening
at Henry Russel's to meet Mary Davis.
& came home early after which she
went to bed - on account of her cold,
23rd. She staid in bed all to day so
I hope to morrow her cold will
be better - I had a nice long letter
from Polly this morning she seems
to be enjoying herself. Amelia Pike
& Harriet Doyle called to ask us to
subscribe to some clothing society. We
were invited to spend the evening
there but as Margt was in bed &
Ned could not go - we declined.
Poor Mary the cook was not at all well
this evening, so I sent her to bed -
which I think made her better -
I must go up to Mary now -
I must go up to Margt now -
24th. This was a fine morining & day.
Margt's cold was better, and she got
up soon after breakfast. Papa was
very much engaged all day with
election affairs - to morrow it [unclear]may[/unclear]
be all decided - I hope he will be elect[unclear]ed[/unclear]
for the honour of the thing. As Mary
had to stay in bed all day, I was pretty
busy - & could not go out. Ellen calld
here at about two or 1Â½ O'clock, but
did not stay very long - I had
no letter from Polly to day -
25 - Papa is no longer Town Councillor
as he was not elected to day
