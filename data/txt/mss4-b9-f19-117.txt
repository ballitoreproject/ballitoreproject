My dear E - I do not like to let this opportunity pass
without letting you know how Willie is we hope he
is on the mending hand tho he still looks very
pale & thin no tooth has yet appear'd I do not
think the Doctor has a bad opinion of him, many
thanks for the eggs & apples I hope one of my fathers
carriers may come soon that I may send home
all the baskets tho' Lydia will take some of them
we go to Glendruid tomorrow to try country air
for Willy we shall miss Lydia greatly she is
so gay & lively, we saw T Stephens to day
he gives a good account of Patty & Jane
I am much obliged for the mats [deletion]I[/deletion] also for
the plait - Edw sends his love & is much obliged for
the book, Lydia is disappointed in not seeing either
Harriet Lefranu or T Boake, I saw the letter
on 2nd day he looks well & is very free & pleasant
& inclined to converse, I think he will be
greatly improved by being with Dr Henry
Saml. Knott is just come in he has
got lodgings in upper Dominick that
very new this & very agreeable

have been [deletion]should cold[/deletion] & Biddy would have
been a good [unclear]thriving[/unclear] servant as well as
nurse we have not settled on a lodging yet
but go to the Glen first my mother & [unclear]Letina[/unclear]
are not yet return'd I believe they wrote but
once since they went thy SB
Elizth Leadbeater
I think Willy looks much better this evening
I have charged Suzy Doyle to look out for
a nursing for Biddy I was glad she seem'd
so well satisfied I'm sure I hope we
may get a nursing for her - ah! if Willy
would have suck'd how pleasant it wd
