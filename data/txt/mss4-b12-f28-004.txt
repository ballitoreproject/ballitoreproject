Cologne Hotel de Holland
July 1st 1850 Uncle Richard's birthday
My dearest Mamma
I write to let you
know of our safe arrival here and
to tell what we did on the way -
we left Paris on Friday evening 28th
[insertion]in[/insertion] [deletion]a[/deletion] the eight oClock train for Brussels -
Uncle Arthur left it two days before we
did it was so hot he could not stand
it. Willie and Mr Symes left it the
same evening that we did but they
all went to England Well! we
arrived at Brussels on Saturday
morning at 5 oClock we went at once
to the Hotel de Swede and went to bed
and slept till half past nine, most
of the buildings were under repair
so we could not get into see them
except one of the Chapels, we were
in the Park wh is next the kings
palace, and in the evening we were

in the Botanic Gardens after wh
we went to the Boulevards, but
they are nothing to those of Paris. there
were such few people, the town
is lighter than Paris and I think
nicer the shops are nicer they have
more variety of things in them
one could get things there which
they could not get in Paris
the people are [underline]not[/underline] as clean as
those in Paris nor as tidy.
We left Brussels yesterday morning
(Sunday) at 1/4 past eleven and
arrived here before ten last night
this Hotel looks out upon the
Rhine. Aunt Eliza's bedroom looks
out upon the river, mine does not
we did our best to get one but could
not as they were all engaged
however I can [insertion]go[/insertion] into Aunt Eliza's
room whenever I like it looks
out upon the landing place and
we can see all the Packets going
and coming. I think this is the
nicest place we were in yet, I like
travelling very much, it is well if I
can stay at home after this, the
morning of the day that I left Paris
I received thy letter and was very
glad to get it. I hope I will get
another when I go to the post today.
I forgot to say in my last letter that
Uncle Thomas brought us to a horsemanship,
we had a good deal of
thunder and Lightning on Wednesday
night last, the three of us sat for
two hours (with the window open
nearly all the time, except when the
rain came on) looking at the lightning
when the rain was over there was
a nice quantity of water on the
balcony & Aunt Eliza & Uncle Thomas
took off their shoes & stockings and

began walking in it and I think they
staid there for 15 minutes -
On Wednesday we were at the
oldest Palace (called the Palais des
Thermes) in Paris, it is really a curiousity
I would not like to have come
away without seeing it, we made
three efforts to get in the third
one was the charm, we were also
at the Mus√©e royale d'Artillerie
that was also well worth seeing
we saw the knife that Ravaillae
killed Henry 4th of France with
the different kind of guns &c
that were there, were very curious
I also saw the sword that belonged
to Sobieski the last king of Poland
We can get out on the top of this Hotel
and see a fine view all along the
Rhine, also over a good part of
the town, the streets are very
narrow here in some of them

there is only room for one car it is so narrow one
could not pass. Dr Henry and Catherine have
not come yet, we expect them this evening,
when I was writing about the thunder and
Lightning I forgot to mention that there was one
flash, we heard the thunder with it, the next
morning we were told that there was a house
struck with it in the same street that we were in
but no harm was done
PS. Give my love to all ever thy affectionate
Daughter
Emily Malone
Aunt Eliza also joins with me
It is a comfort that John is
gone is Miss McAuley going?
