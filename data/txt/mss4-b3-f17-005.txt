My dear Cousin


        I am exceedingly obliged by thy kind remembrance of me, Though after so many daysYes! Betsy would not withhold from me so pleasing intelligence as the happy issue of my dear Debbys confinementshe has now got cause for solicitude to which she has hitherto been a strangerI think myself in some measure qualified to participate of the anxious anticipation of a mother for her Child, being I believe not a stranger to similar experience on account of my sweet Agatha the [sic] present favourite ^opinion^ seems to be that of resembling the Infantile mind to a sheet of fair white paper which received no impressions but those you give it, I am much more inclined to view it as a tract of unoccupied ground; and with this view I am ever fearful of planting seeds that will not bring fourth savoury fruit and on the other hand apprehensive that for want of proper cultivation its ^produce^ may be only weeds & briars
        I am delighted with the descriptions I have of Abraham & Lydia, they raise a vain wish that I could behold them myself - the enjoyment of seeing others happy, is indeed a high flavoured one; and strikes me as an earnest of more exalted bliss
        The advancements in your Meeting are truly comfortable our meetings as well as all other establishments manifest a perpetual Change, desolation seems to mark us here at presentJ Roper has revived an affair on which he had some years back obtained a lenient decree - which has, & does, raise painful dissension in the monthly Meeting
        Yes! I have heard & mourned for Joseph Jacob - it is agreeable that his Widow keeps up tolerably
        Salute thy whole family for me with the most tender regard         I have written thee my dear Cousin such a letter as the interruptions of the Children would admit, fearing that if I waited for more leisure I might be some ^time^ without meeting so convenient a conveyanceThy Affectionate & Obliged
