Dublin 20th of 8 month 1788

Dear Cousin
Richard Shackleton,

	I duly received thy kind favour of 7th Instant, my dear Nancy & I are thankful for thy & Cousin Elizabeths affectionate Invitation for her & Betsy to spend a while with you at Ballitore, which I believe they would have accepted of ere now, had not the Indisposition of our Servant Maid prevented; however as she is, now Recovering, they hope to go in a Week or two, & have no doubt of your & Childrens kindness, in doing all in your power to make their Stay both agreeable & useful to their Health. I think my dear Nancy in particular requires such an Excursion, after Such fatagues [sic] as She has undergone in attending on our dear Child, who, I believe has made a Glorious exchange, which he had an Evidence of & often prayed for; indeed his Expressions were frequently more like those of an Experienced person in Religion, than a Child of ten years old. 
	The friendly desire thou expressed, that our various Probations may be Sanctified to us & operate the gracious end which a most tender & merciful Father designs by his Chastisementshath been frequently the fervent desire or prayer of our Hearts; for tho we have met with Several Trials ^(which may be compared to a Rod of Correction)^ hard to human nature to bear, yet are far from Repining, but on the Contrary have abundant Cause to be humbly Thankful, that the Staff of divine Support hath been eminently handed forth in the needful time, & hath kept us from sinking in the Floods of discouragements, which we have hitherto had as yet to pass through: Oh! that the Almighty may be pleased mercifully to preserve us to the End, & qualify us to Say (with true faith in his power & Goodness) as that Experienced Servant of the Lord did - (the Royal Psalmist) - Tho I walk through the Valley of the Shadow of death, I will fear no Evil: for thou art with me; thy Rod & thy Staff they comfort me.
	I send this, by our friend Jonathan [Jonah?] Hill, who I expect will meet thee at Ennisworthy: it would be agreeable to me to be there at [letter crossed out] the ensuing Solemnity, if I was not particularly Circumstanced at present, therefore hope the Will may be 
taken for the deed.  If thou finds freedom to favour me with a Letter either from Ennisworthy or home, be assured it will be truly acceptable & with dear Love to Cousin Betty, thy Children & Self in which my dear Nancy & Betsey joins, I Remain Thy very affectionate Kinsman Richard Pike

PS/ Please remember me very affectionately to my worthy friend thy Son, tell him I hope we have not in any Manner offended him; as he has of late withheld his friendly & Edifying Epistolary correspondance [sic] from us. 
	An accident happened this paper, when I had about half finished the Letter, & had not time to Copy it over - therefore hope thoull Excuse its [sic] being so shamefully daubed.
