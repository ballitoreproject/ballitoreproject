7Â¼ as he had to go in early.
We worked up in Aunt
Eliza's room nearly all
the morning indeed
until dinner time,
after which we worked
and wrote letters - I
wrote to L White from
whom I had a note this
morning telling me
that if I had no objection
I might go to Orange Hill
on Second day morning
in the carriage which
is to go for the bride and
bridegroom I suppose -
It is to be there by nine
so I shall be stirring early.
Well after an early tea, Aunt
E and I went into Banbrid[unclear]ge[/unclear]
