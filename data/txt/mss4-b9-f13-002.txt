20 March, 1822
I did not like to address thee my beloved Sarah until I had
in some degree overcome the pain of parting lest I should infect
thee with my sadness and goodness knows I would not
wish in the slightest degree to abate thy happiness - but
I need not make apologies to thee but tell thee how I fared
since thou left me - I never felt so lonely - and the thought
that we were separated for ever for I consider the angel visits
we may be able to pay each other only as gleams of sunshine
[deletion]Was[/deletion] [insertion]Mid[/insertion] renewing storms to think that the pleasures the hopes
and fears we have shared since childhood we can share no
longer wring and wrings my heart with feelings painful as
they are new, - But I said I would not be sorrowful & that
I would not make thee sad my [underline]Sal Dabs[/underline]. I trust we shall
have many merry meetings and if we have not we may
bless the inventor of penmanship. Poor Deborah & I feel
dependant on each other - but we cannot be as much together
as we wish - she is very cheerful & caught no cold.
Richard is just come - we did not expect him today -
Knowing Dublin had almost as bewitching delights as
Armida's bower - however he proved himself more of a
philosopher than I hoped. He brought me thy very
welcome letter which has done more to cheer me than
all the rhetorich & philosophy I could pour on myself
I have made a vow of keeping thy letters sacred, indeed of
late I have not been asked to shew my letters - thanks
for thy enquiries of Sir C- he is quite well but feels as
[underline]we[/underline] might expect who know his heart our mingled sorrow
& joy - I had a letter from him yesterday some of which
when I am a little more retired I will extract. Mary

Shackleton had a letter from Thomas - I did not see it but
I hear it was almost all about the Grahams, M. tells me
there is a [underline]secret[/underline] in it a secret of Theodore's I guess but I was
very glad of it as it made her better satisfied with its
scanty [deletion]letter[/deletion] size - I expect a letter from him almost daily.
Richard has not as yet told me any thing about you not
even how you look - however I forgive him as I know he must
feel somehow so, so, after all his pleasures to return to busy
life again - and all the plots & plans of this worky-day
world particularly in a malty year & the old oats fusty. No!
not even the little tin measure, the black tray, the winnowing
machine with the new screen will have power to console him.
Poor Mary Doyle is as well, nay better than we expected
there is a settled gloom over her once cheerful countenance
but she is quite calm & speaks of Anne often - I sometimes
think that we will feel her loss yet much more than we do
now - the thought of her languid step & feeble form will
fade away & give place to the recollections of other days when
her form was light her step active & [insertion]her[/insertion] conversation so pleasant
& instructive - oh! the joyous evenings spent by their canny
single which we can never spend again - Ach home but
pleasures are like poppies [unclear]spreading[/unclear]
Ellen Wright told me a story - here it is: A woman
said to her in the shop 6th day "So I hear one of the Miss
Leadbeaters is married & gone off?" "Yes" "and not the
eldest [underline]either[/underline]?" "No, the second" Don't you [underline]wonder he'd quit[/underline]
them then that way" - I must leave thee & get tea.
Eliza Gough has put the finishing stroke to her correspondence
with the clever unknown - she is extremely sorry she
did not listen to thy reason & I believe never loved thee
better in her life than now - She did not bid me tell
thee so. The kettle is boiling - Adieu dear.

I was much surprised on seventh day to see the kitchen door
opened by Mrs Dumphy leading in buxom Judy - she
is come to seek for a home in this valley once more
declares she has got [underline]no[/underline] health since she left it - & appears
more mad than ever - Judy has got a huge straw bonnet
which Madame the aunt tells me is a turned one.
of her sisters - Poor Judy was rather bewildered between
saving her great bonnet which was in the way of every
thing & endeavouring to kiss her hand to the lady
that hand which was already possessed by an immense
orange - however to press its fragrant case with her
why lips was but the work, thought of a moment &
did the Lady quite as well. She is to get a room in Capt
Grattan's quondam abode, where it is thought Susan Butler
will take up her residence also. Goodbye for the night
19th Here I am again my dear Sarah - but I cannot stay
long. Elizths letter will tell thee of [insertion]the[/insertion] events of this day
I am longing for her return - but if a wish would
leave her with thee & that wish coincided with thine
it should be quickly breathed. Fanny Bewley with
earnestness begged I would send thee her love Lucy
regrets extremely not having come with her mother
to bid thee farewell on 4th day. Ah! Lucy is Lucy
still, and [insertion]when[/insertion] I think of the many pleasant hours we
spent in Childhoods rosy season I feel a glow in
my bosom that surely may be called friendship
which would take many cold looks to blast. Hast
thou yet seen M Humphries & her young one & what
sort is it? We have sorrow again beside us - poor
Lucretia is great grief for the death of her father.
My aunt Sally desires her dear love to thee. Farewell
for the night my pen is too bad & my eyelids to heavy to go on.

20th What art thou doing now it is almost 10 o'clock & you
return - it must be when thou writes to [insertion]her[/insertion] - for when this
are not settled after breakfast - Elizth is meditating going
to see some of her friends & is thinking it is a shame for
us not to write - and lo! John enters with my mothers &
my joint letter - this brings joy with it though he is
never long absent from your circle. Richard told me
very little about you according to his old trick.
James Haughton and his bride are on their way to
your hemisphere what brilliant constellations will adorn
it. I have began once more Hooke's Roman history & have
read to huma - Dost thou remember when we began it
together I often think of thee when I am reading some
thing I would like to say "oh!" at. I intend to get the
ancient maps from James White & on finding the
places there to seek in the modern ones for their
present name - this I hope will improve me in Geography -
if thou hast found any mode of learning
that study I would thank thee to tell it me - I [unclear]mean[/unclear]
any mode but learning by heart which I very much
dislike - Now I am silent and lonely I will give
the promised extracts from Sir Calidore's letter
"Thanks for Sarah's remembrance I send my warm love in
reaches thee she will be at her new home - Can I ever forget
I never can or will - that she told me that next to Edward
she most wished my company at her wedding - how did
my refusal express my feelings of gratitude for that invitation
& wish - badly indeed & I feared she could not know
how I felt the kindness of that pressing invitation which
I would gladly have accepted if I could." "I look forward
with much pleasure to visiting our dear Sarah in May
she will take me to Glendruid & I shall see thy dear friend
Eliza whom I long to know" enough from Sir C - there is
more which I would like greatly to read to thee but -
Hannah will I believe come after the meeting to us - I
am very anxious to become acquainted with her or with Sally.

that I need not go amongst them a total stranger - oh!

I could not get a opportunity except by Happy Campbell
Citoyenne
Thy ever affectionate

H W slept with me last night
7th day.
Rich'd bids me tell thee that he would
thank thee to tell Frank Johnson that
he left his umbrella at John Wrights
My mother dear love would thank
thee to correct her proof sheets or
Edward. My love to Edward.
these partings! I wish I had an opportunity for this
as it is now impossible to send it by post. I am
in expectation of Betsy's coming to dine here to day
Mary & I went to visit Kitty Kearney - amongst a strange
variety of discourse she advised me when I would be
going to my own house, to bring in the bottom of
my trunk some bottles of wine & spirits to have
unknown that I might mull & drink [insertion]it[/insertion] without
saying [underline]nothing[/underline] to [underline]nobody[/underline] & to keep me at
my bed's head for night consumption. Romulus
made a law that all wives who would drink wine
should be killed or might be so by their lords &
master's & who knows but I might share the same
fate, for I know not the customs of the West.
Enter George, every one who sees me writing looks
quizzical at me as much as to say "Oh! ho he's
a happy man. Exit George. Enter Grace Ball, my
mother away had to do her says she was extremely
sorry none of them could be at thy
marriage - heard the day was put off ([unclear]exit[/unclear])
My father was bad with the tooth ache - write
soon to me I pray thee. Farewell ma ch√®re
the carman which will make this very old ere it reaches
thee - write soon. Jo: Greenwood & H White dined with us
