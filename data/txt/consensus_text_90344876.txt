her a great deal - they were old
acquaintances. I have
just received a little note by post
from Polly, am all alone
scribbling this. Margt somewhere
up stairs & Ned stowed away
some place up there also I believe.
John down in office I suppose,
Charlie rode out to Fassaroe
yesterday evening, to enjoy
a few days in the country,
which I, hope will do the
poor fellow some good, for
he does not look well -
7th.. Seventh day came round
again. Papa came in from
Fassaroe this morning &
brought me in a few lines
from Polly. At about 1 O'clock
as John was so kind as to
lend us his car, Margt and
I drove out to see Aunt Lydia
