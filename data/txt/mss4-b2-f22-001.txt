Clonmel 11th month 14th 1785.

Honoured Grandfather,

The Master has informed me that a letter from thy grandson would be acceptable, a Piece of news that made my heart glad, and I have written this with all my might, in order to deserve serve thy Approbation, and to let thee see that I am not as insignificant a boy as some may suppose, for tho I have not much flesh, I may inherit, from thee, some Genius. With duty to my Grandmother, Uncle and Aunts, and love to my Cousins, I remain thy dutiful grandson

Abraham Grubb.

My Cousins Henry and Robert Grubb desire their love to thee.
