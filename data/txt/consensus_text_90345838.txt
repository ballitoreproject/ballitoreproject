On we trotted till we came to the
Madden bridge when the grey started
at some carts - Violet followed the
example reared up and some how
or another fell back - - I got a fearful
fall on my back - Violet only tumbled
on my legs, how I escaped I don't know
without being more seriously injured
as it was my back nearly made me
faint - However after a while I walked
down with Avi's help to the inn parlour
down with Avy's help to the inn parlour
got myself brushed and Violet dusted
and then remounted - She went on
till we met Rachel when we slowly
wound our way home - and so ended
my share of the ride - Avy escorted R
home and staid to tea - Poor Polly
was rather frightened and now I wont
be able to help her but must lie by till I
get well - Polly is pretty well
11 Wednesday - Rachel Haughton her father
and [unclear]Mcdiamed[/unclear] Beatty called to day - Rachel
is going to Warrenpoint on Saturday to her
sister Annie - Avy tried to take a photograph
