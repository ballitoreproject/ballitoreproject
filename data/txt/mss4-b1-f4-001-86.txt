R.S. to his Daughter G.
Colebrook Dale 4th of Sixthmonth 1791.
My Dear Margaret,
Believing it will be acceptable to thee to hear from me, I take
up the pen at the house of our friend Richard Reynolds, and have, through
the continued kindness of merciful Providence, to inform thee that I am
in good health, enjoying the converse of friends, whom I feel near to my
heart, and to whose hearts I have abundant reason to think I am nearly
united. ***

And now, my beloved Margaret *** I must draw to
a conclusion. Thou knowest that thou art exceedingly near and dear to
me, and that thy poor father's chief joy is to see, to be sensible, that
the children of the elect lady walk in the truth. Thou hast received
a heavenly gift, let it be of whatever denomination it may. What matters
the name of it? Attend upon it, prize it: it is the wisdom which is
more precious than rubies. Exercise it when the great Master bids; when
He cometh, calleth for thee, singles thee out, and puts thee forth in any
little service. This is the way for the waters of this life's afflictions
to be changed into the wine of the kingdom, and for the sorrows and
perplexities of this world to be turned into heavenly joy.
