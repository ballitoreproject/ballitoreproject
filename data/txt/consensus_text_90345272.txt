train, arrived there at about 1¼ I think
and roamed about till 3¼ when
we returned. The day was so fine
the air so fresh and everything so
new to me, I enjoyed myself greatly
as for the views they were lovely, tho'
first day, I was almost wishing for
my sketching book, they looked so
tempting. Margaret and I dined at
John's .
17th.. Aunt Eliza and Uncle Francis came
up from Dunlavin this morning
bringing but a poor account of
Uncle Thomas, who since his arrival [insertion]there[/insertion]
on seventh day evening has been laid
up with rheumatism in his arm
suffering great pain at times. Aunt
E returned by the four O'clock train.
Uncle Francis dined with us. Charlie
and Liddy came up this evening.
It is very pleasant to have them
home again. Papa came in this
morning. We are going to have
quite a little party this evening.
