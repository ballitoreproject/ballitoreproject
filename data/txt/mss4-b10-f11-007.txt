Glendruid January 22nd 1824
Dear John
I take up my pen at last, but I have
very little to say, I believe I write the same thing over, and
over in every letter. I suppose you know that Mr Keightley is
going away. I am not very sorry, I think I should have
learned more with Eliza than with him, he does not seem
to take pleasure in teaching us anything, but perhaps that
is our own fault, I think I know more French than when
he came first, and of arithmetic, we have not finished the
history of England yet, tho we began it when he came first
[deletion]that [deletion][/deletion] Manliff, Arthur and I [deletion]were[/deletion] [insertion]are[/insertion] reading it. Do you know
whether Humbolts travels are in the library, I should
like to read them. I should like to read a history of Spain
I was reading a part of it [deletion]to [/deletion] in the Encyclopaedia
 but it only gives the outlines of the things that happened
at that time, they were a brave set of people,
but they were almost reduced to subjection, by the
Romans, under Pompey the Great and Metellus.
they [insertion]Romans[/insertion] were defeated in several battles by the Spaniards
under Sertorius, a Roman by birth, a very renowned commander,
he was afterwards murdered by Paperna, one

of the chiefs under him, but I suppose I am telling you
what you know already. I went out to ride on Monday
with Eliza, but we did not ride far, we went out in
the car yesterday, Lucy and Selina rode, it was a very
fine day, we met several carriages, and gentlemen riding.
I thought until the other day that thunder
did no harm, I was reading something about it in
the Encyclopaedia, where it has knoked down a
steeple of a Church, and done more mischief besides
I thought it was only the lightning that did harm;
Doctor Franklin tried a great many experiments with
lightning, he says that a pointed conducter would
not attract it so much as another, I dont know rightly
how it should attract it at all.
30th the first part of this letter was written more than a
week ago, I received yours yesterday by my father.
2nd of February. I do not think I can tell you why I get
[deletion]got[/deletion] perplexed about those things you mentioned. I go
on thinking and thinking until all my thoughts are jumbled
together [insertion]so[/insertion] that they all go for nothing. It is not because the Adventurer
is in two volumes that I like it less than the Spectator
there are not so many interesting papers in it, altogether
I do not like it so well as the Spectator. I am reading no
history now, except the history of Spain, in the Encyclopaedia
I should like to read a history of Greece. I am [deletion]not[/deletion] [deletion][unclear][/unclear][/deletion]
[deletion]afraid of[/deletion] obliged to you for giving me the advice about
reading novels, I hope I shall mind what you say about them

I dont think [deletion][/deletion] [insertion]there[/insertion] would be greater joy at least to me to
receive [deletion]such[/deletion]  [insertion]so[/insertion] long a letter from you if you wer a hundred
miles off than if you were but seven. I do not think
I know the right meaning of Sympathy, I believe it means
to sympathise with one, or to comfort one, may be this is
not the right meaning if not will you tell it to me.
Mr Keightley is going to stay another month here.
I dont see much use in his staying, he sits reading at the
fire [insertion]all the time[/insertion], I believe he would not mind us if we were all sitting
idle. I want to get a French book, but do not know
what sort of one to get. I think I should [insertion]not[/insertion] like a history
in French, I would not have patience to finish it, I would
like something more interesting, do you know of one. I want
to buy it. This has been one of the finest days we have
had this year, both the sea and mountains look very
handsome, the birds were singing all day; the air was
quite warm. Eliza Lucy and my father went out to ride
Selina and I went round the glen, there is a hawthorn
in the glen almost covered with leaves, summer will be
here very soon now. If you see any mistakes in this
letter, please tell me of them, yours
Emily
