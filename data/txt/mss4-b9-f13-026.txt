Mill O'Marne 23rd of 3rd mo 1828
My dearest Sarah
Here we are since 2nd day evening Lyds &
Josy, & are expecting to hear or see thee &Edwd. Eben
is still confined with his foot which was wounded by a
pitch fork, but as "Delays are Dangerous" this is to
propose thou should come with Richard who means to
go up next 3rd day & says he will escort thee & thy
little ones &cc provided thou will be ready 4th or
5th day. Edwd. will follow of course. We are rejoiced
to hear of poor Emily being able to ride out & hope
she will now recover more rapidly.
I have it all settled as Richard can tell thee
& we are longing fairly for you.
I will leave this for Lyds to add to -
My dearest Sarah. - I have left my darling home
one week since & am longing to see thee - I feel I
cannot exceed my limits for I have the home
sickness frequently. - I mean to divide my time
fair between thee & Debs. - Now if thou could come
& [deletion]give[/deletion] let us join some of the time here - we might
enjoy ourselves as much & give more pleasure to
Debs. I am in great hopes that Edwd will approve
of this plan & bring thee early next week

or send thee by Rich'd & follow himself
I am longing to see [unclear] Eben/Edwrd [/unclear] Poor James
is tugging at the oar & I away from him
when my place is by his side.
In great haste adieu
L.J Fisher
My dear Edw'd

net thy place the amot.. to accot
