I did not expect that I should have remained so long silent after the receipt of my dear friends very kind & obliging letter; but indisposition & engagements at home & abroad combined to prevent my writing. I was concerned to hear of thy illness & confinement  Thou hast been often ailing  & I have often thought about thee  We are variously modified in our mental complexions, habits & dispositions, & our common Creator & Preserver uses various means in correcting, reforming & preparing us. Sometimes the body is touched, sometimes the mind, & sometimes the outward substance. Our best way at all events appears to me to make haste to get under the shelter of the wing of Omnipotence. There contemplating & meditating that all things good & evil are allotted or permitted to us by Infinite Wisdom, & resigning all to the disposal & ordering hand of our great Benefactor & best Friend, we settle in a comfortable composure & acquiescence with the Divine Will. This should be our daily labour - to feel after & witness the hiding of his power  And the day of tranquillity & prosperity is not only the most acceptable, but the most convenient & commodious day for this purpose. While affliction of body & distress of mind are suspended, we can more readily get into that stillness & patient waiting, in which is experienced the renewing of spiritual strength. Let us imitate the halcyon, or whatever bird it is, which is said to build its nest on the fluctuating sea, in a calm. May thy temper of mind and body often witness this calm, & thy nest (the dispensation which then mayest be under) be watched over & guarded by him that rules the winds & waves

of this tumultuary life! I am earnestly solicitous that nothing should hurt thee, neither heights nor depths, things present, nor yet to come. The cause which thou hast been honoured in giving thy voice in support of, is the greatest, the noblest, the most interesting & important that ever existed on earth, so glorious that even the angels desired to look into it. Mayest thou be enabled to keep such wise & diligent watch over thy vessel, which contains the heavenly treasure, that when thou drawest out of it for others, at the Masters bidding, the liquor may be ever unadulterated; pure & precious. This will tend to the glory of Him that has called to bring forth much fruit, to the edification of the church, & to the consolidating of thy own peace. +++ The door of admission into unity with the living members of the church of Christ is by Baptism, that Baptism which often repeated & continued, purges & cleanses the soul from the spots & defilement of the world, & reduces to the state of a little child, in which only the kingdom is to be received. Many are the devices of the enemy to hurt & hinder the Lords work: & if he finds he cannot prevail to draw back wholly & palpably into the world again, he often endeavours to allure to take up a rest too soon, so the inward man in the new creation is incomplete, the holy leaven has not pervaded the whole mass, the cake has not been turned. May it not be so with  but may she follow on to know the Lord, in the progressive operations of his spirit, & turning of his hand upon her, that if he has been her Alpha, he may also be her Omega if he has mercifully laid the foundation, he may be graciously pleased to lay the top stone of her spiritual building! [pencil] x - Perhaps three weeks hence we may know more of one another, as probably I may be, with other friends, at your meeting 25th instant: - I mean if able to go, for the sake of good order & example; but I am seem lost in a sense of my insignificance & unworthiness - I am under numberless obligations to my great Creator, for which my spirit is at times bowed in humble thankfulness: but this sight ^& sense^ of my own low estate, which preserves in humility of heart, I receive as a capital favour at the divine hand

Mountrath - I wish ye could be oftener together; but it seems as though you were obliged to comply at present with the Apostles injunction, whether ye would or not  I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house. Domestick cares & indisposition in the family prevent very frequent interviews between you: however, this advantage probably is derived that abstinence quickens your appetite, & gives you a keener relish for each others converse  I find thou wast not out during the solemnity of your general meeting, & the visit paid there by these eminent female publishers.* This privation (one would think) proved a close trial to thee, who hast an ear to hear the melody of the Gospel, than which is there any thing more delightful?
[pencil] x My wife & children join me in kind greetings to thee & thy husband & all your house. May it be mercifully preserved to be as the house of Obed-Edom, where the ark of the testimony rested, &, in consequence, the divine blessing rested also! Whenever freedom & convenience ^will^ unite to induce thee to give me a line, I shall esteem it as a particular favour, for be assured thy correspondence is highly grateful as thy welfare is very dear to
thy truly affectionate friend
