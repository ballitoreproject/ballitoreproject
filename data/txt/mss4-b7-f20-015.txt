My dear Madam
It is indeed so very long since I have
written that I do not wonder that you are a
little surprized. With our annual visit of three
months to London, & of three weeks to Norfolk
& three being confined with an attack of
Erysipelas have with the business of each
day so entirely occupied me that tho' I
have continually intended to answer your
very obliging & acceptable letters hitherto
I have been prevented. I am glad you approved
the Tables & the Children papers. more are
at your service if you wish for them.
the latter was I think a very proper subject
for the Farmers Journal. how sad a thing
that the amiable Editor should be no
more. such characters are indeed an
irreparable loss & the active part he

took in a business that diffused knowledge
through so large a district makes his
death the heavier loss. I shall not dismiss
from my mind the amiable man you have
so well described but shall consider his example
as one of those shining lights that are
from time to time [unclear][/unclear] for the good of mankind
I hope his Paper will continue to be well
conducted. Your dialogue for the instruction
of Mothers I much approve. I shew'd
it to Mrs Fennell Bunton whose sister
Mrs Saml [unclear]Hoare/unclear] is writing instructions
for Nurses. She thinks you have treated
the subject extremely well such that it
will bear enlarging, which makes me
wish to see a second part upon the
same subject from your pen - I hope you
will continue your labors which are likely

to be of so much benefit to your Country
your Cottage dialogues are universally
approved wherever they are known. your
narrative of Catherine may be [unclear][/unclear] into an
excellent animating example of modesty
worth & industry. Will you have the
kindness to give her the enclosed pound
note either in money or clothes or in
any way you may think best - perhaps
you will give her a line to say you
have received it safely as I do not think
the post a very safe conveyance for money -
I am quite pleased with the good account
of the Finn Family. I am much interested
for them & sincerely hope that Dorothy will
soon be reconnected to her Daughter. one reason
why I have not written sooner is that
I wished Mr Smith to read your poem
which he has done with much pleasure
within these few days. he tells me he

much likes many parts of it in which he
finds a true spirit of [unclear]poetry[/unclear] & many [unclear][/unclear]
lines & beautiful passages, but he thinks
the examples too much resemble each other -
with us, people are so fastidious about
poetry that every poem [insertion]given to the public[/insertion] that is not
revised, polished, & cut down till it is
almost faultless must expect to be severely
criticised by our unpitying reviewers -
it is said Mr Rogers's Columbus took thirty
years & at last he only ventured to publish
it as a fragment - but while you [unclear]confine[/unclear]
your manuscript to the closet, it will
give much pleasure to your friends & to
these whom you favor with a sight of it
without the super-abundant labor
which I fear it is necessary to bestow
upon poems which are destined for the press.
as you ask for my opinion I have
ventured to give it you frankly & hope
you will not think I have taken too
