Dublin Jan 19th 1828
My dear Elizabeth
I recd your letter of the 17th
by Jane Stephens and lose no time in replying
thereto, but first of all I have to apologize
for not returning to take leave of you
the other morning, which I could not
do, after [deletion]every[/deletion] what I had to do at the
Inn, without being too late for the coach.
I have consulted with an experienced
attorney here on the subject of your making
business for rent. His decided advice is
that it would be better to employ some Attorney
the best you can get in your own neighborhood
who attends at your own Co Sessions
to manage your county business about
recovering Rents and small Debts. The
expense will be much less and the
business better done being on the spot.
There is no doubt you are fully qualified
to act in such matters. I should think
under this view that by enquiring, [insertion]such[/insertion] a person
skilled in the law might be got to whom
it would be safe to entrust [unclear]Congress[/unclear], &
Waters business. With regard to the Inn
Affairs I shall write as soon as I can
to you and Eben. We are obliged for the
trouble you have had about them. I

am sorry to say that poor Emily is
in more danger than ever and we
fear the worst. I went to the glen
yesterday and found she had not
been at any time so well as I expected
and thought. I have but little hope
[unclear]of his[/unclear] adieu and believe me your
ever affectionate EB
I shall have the land for NB and
your leares ready to send to you by
the first opportunity I believe
My dear E many thanks for the stockings
which fit Mag : I intend to write at lengthe
soon tell D that the little woman's flannel
is 2/6 per yd she says she never had any
at a lower price tell L White to send
Bess Hawey a little bit of her gown
that she may get the name of it for
her she wd not venture to get it
without a pattern the post goes ever
thy L B

Dear E
He with kindness to send
[unclear]us by[/unclear] the first opportunity an acct
showing what we owe for any
articles [insertion]of [unclear]furniture &co[/unclear][/insertion] purchased at the time or
previous to the auctions or since
