Wm.. Leadbeater
Mt.. melick.
Is there in the Pro: School a girl, who might suit Hannah Haughton
to asist her in the shop, & whose manners & disposition are such as might
qualify her to be as an adopted sister to this worthy creature, who is now on
the point of being without one? as our beloved S: H: is now in the dark avenues
leading to the chambers of death. As there are reasons which make her wish
not to have this enquiry much known, I thought it best to make it of my
friend W. L. & request an answer by my father. I had a letter lately from
A: Grubb who mentions thee with kindness, & invites thee to their Qtrly meeting.
I told thee in Mt.melick I thought thou might adopt the Advices as
thou pleased, yet afterwards feared I was too hasty; so enquired [deletion]from[/deletion] &
A: G: seems to wish thou would not adopt them till I hear from her again.
Farewell. MS:
Fourth day.
