My dear Molly
I am also stinted for time, yet am unwilling to
let the present opportunity pass without sending a line, its pleasing
to hear thy dear Mother has got rid of her cough, and as the weather
gets warmer I expect she will be otherways better, it has of late
been very trying, high winds and cold, I hope it may be more mild
before out fathers return, we had a letter yesterday from my father
he was well as was all our friends from Ireland, he dont write
very particular but seems not to repent going, says they had crowded
meetings and sends love to his friends - our dear Sally seems to
think better of my few lines than they deserved, I could hardly expect
her to reply to them as she is at present engaged, tho one line from her
I'de prize, she seem'd anxious to hear from thy Mother before she left
thee and as I heard [unclear]R. Disas[/unclear] sending a frank I thought I would just
give her what information I had got, and make some apology or
express my regret at not having gone with her to O Williams the
morning she left us, she kindly wrote me some little account of their
travels to William Freemans [insertion]by Ben: Glorney[/insertion] and desired I'd let you know, but I had
[slipped line]
no opportunity I think since you have since heard from her, she
expresses it a favour to be with M.D. and desires to [insertion]be[/insertion] preserved to know
and feel her own littleness, beautifull humility I hope it will prove
her safety- perhaps you have heard of the declining state of health
that John Dawson [insertion]Jim[/insertion] appears to be in, this some time past he has
[1791]

been poorly, but its like hid it in part, especially from his father.
Jon Garrett was uneasy and prevail'd on him to let his father know, who
was no doubt distressed and consulted Doctor Purcell, he immediately
ordered him to the hot wells Bristol, and gave but little hope of
him, tho I hear he parents are not as much alarmed as might be
expected. R Eagan is to go with him- Anna's marriage I hear is again
put off until sixthday week- William Beale return'd but week from
Mt. Melick, and is like shortly to make that place his home, he offer'd
to Brother John to live with him, but I cant say on what terms
as we have not heard from them about it yet, and was backward
of asking William much [deletion]of[/deletion] but the proposal met with Johnny
approbation and I hope it may answer on both sides very well.
The cotton &e I got for thy Mother but I was late for last opportunity
I intend sending it this . cost 3/5- I dont know at all any thing of the
1/4 1/2 Thou says thou owed me, but I am willing to take thy word for more
than that on other side, I also intend sending thy [underline]old[/underline] silk handkerchief
Neither of us are like to be at Moote, farewell my dear Molly, I
must for tho present lay down my being, remember me affectionately
to thy Mother & William, with any other that may inquire for thy
Dublin 5. mo 23rd 1791
