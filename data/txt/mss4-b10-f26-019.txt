Prague April 9th 1847
My dear Mother
We had a most delightful drive from
Pirna to Toplitz or Teplitz as it is pronounced here - We
did not go through the Saxon Switzerland as was first
spoken as we thought [insertion]it better[/insertion] and James advised us to see Prague
by all means if we could - We engaged a Carriage at Dresden
to take us as far as Toplitz stopping one night on the road wh we
did at Pirna as I mentioned in Martha's note - from Pirna
we began to ascend the Bohemian mountains clothed to
the very top some of them were with trees mostly Spruce
Fir which are self sown and in many places we saw
the young trees coming up as thick as the Ash tree seedling
are in the Glen - the woods are in some parts almost impervious
the Snow was very thick in some places & extended over
large tracts - but the road was clear it had been cleared I
suppose for in one part it was as high as the top of the
carriage at each side - every mile we went was
beautiful in itself besides the magnificent view
of the mountains in the distance and near - it was
literally like a sea of mountains the different ranges
rising one behind the other like the waves of the sea
almost all of them conical shaped there were two
we watched for a long time so like the [insertion]our[/insertion] two sugar loaves
that we called them by those names and at last we
passed between them - towering up above everything
we were obliged to have additional horses ascending the
hills - We were all greatly pleased with the drive it
was worth all we saw since we left home - it was
not all new to the Girls as they had come from Prague

before - We arrived at Toplitz about 4 oclock and had dinner
and then prepared to go out & see what was worth
seeing - there is not much worth seeing in the town itself
it is situated in the bottom of a valley & is one of the
most fashionable watering places in Germany we did
not go with any of the bath houses but walked about
the town a little & then ascended one of rising ground
to look again at the mountains. we were in a
very nice hotel for wh. we paid pretty well - when
we had fatigued ourselves pretty well & the night
coming on we returned to the hotel & had [insertion]Tea[/insertion] coffee and
then went to bed first engaging another carriage
to take us on to Prague the next day we started at
7 oclock after breakfast soon after we left the town
we had to take another pair of horses and were
ascending for several hours - when we got to the
top of the heights - the extra horses were sent back
and we then descended [underline]into[/underline] Bohemia which
is a flat country entirely surrounded by mountains
we left the snow behind us but not the cold as
no time since we left home did we feel the
cold so much as [deletion]the[/deletion] part of our drive towards
evening before getting to Prague for we had a brisk
wind - exceedingly cold it was nine oclock at night
before we got to our jouneys end - we first had to stop
on the confines of the City to have our luggage searched
but got off by paying a small sum - then in about
1/2 an hour after on entering one of the gates we had
to give up our Passports & get something in exchange
for them, we at last got here to the "Golden Angel" and are
very comfortable tho' not so [underline]nice[/underline] or [underline]grand[/underline] as in Toplitz -
we are exactly opposite the house of the Commander
chief of the Forces & have been amusing ourselves both
evenings looking at the company going & coming from
it - the windows are some of them without blinds
& we can see all that pass in & out of the drawing
room & can even see the tables spread & the people
sitting at them taking coffee & other refreshments.
It is a very curious City far more curious & foreign
than any thing we have yet seen - from the terrace
under the castle wall last evening I counted
30 Spires or Minarets & left many uncounted it
has quite an Eastern appearance in its building
but there is no peculiarity of costume - the lower
orders here tho' similar in their dress to those at Dresden
are neither so comfortable looking nor so clean
indeed I would call them [underline]dirty[/underline] here but they are
not ragged like the Irish - It was a great disappointment
to me to be obliged to leave Dresden without
getting [deletion]a[/deletion] letters from you but I could not help it
as it would have disarrayed the plans of too many
others to have waited for them - I trust I shall have
good accounts when I do hear from you all - I can
scarcely believe I am so far away and to think I am
in Prague is like a dream - but tho' the Cities are curious
I receive more pleasure from the fine scenery so you
may guess what charms our two days drive here
gave me - we are not to return by the same way
but what way we are to go I must leave until

I write next to tell you. I believe we are to leave
this today & I wish to have this [insertion]letter[/insertion] posted from this
place - you must excuse our not paying the
postage as every one here tells us that in Austria
letters are neglected to be forwarded that are postpaid
beforehand - If there was any thing urgent you
might send a letter on chance immediately on the
receipt of this to Hamburg - [deletion]but[/deletion] as if any thing delayed
us we might receive it - but I hope we will have
left that and be nearer home by that time - We
have no chance of hearing any where from you
after we leave Dresden & I will therefore be very
anxious to see you all again - I cannot settle
my mind to give directions about any thing
that is doing at Glenagearry - I leave it all feeling
assured that their will be all the care taken that
can be about every thing - I told Denny I wished to have
the ceilings of drawing room & my own room cleaned before
our return if he was disengaged from other work - the seeds
necessary to be sown I told Mooney to ask you about - the
weather here is quite as uncertain as at home I see
no difference - both yesterday & t. day have been showery
and the cold that we feel when there is wind is more like
the piercing kind which usually precedes snow with us
[unclear][/unclear] give my dear love to all my own dear ones, Thos.
bids me join him this also - I think when I get home
I shall think I have been in a dream these last few
weeks - We are just going out to see some more sights
so I must conclude this & prepare it for post you
may read Marthas note & let her see this also - farewell my dearest
mother your affection daughter EH
