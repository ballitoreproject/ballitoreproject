9th.. month.
7th.. As Uncle Thomas had
never been to Lough Bray, this
morning being fine, Ned
and Polly went with him
there, I for a wonder staying
at home to mind the place
They did not return till
nearly four O'clock. when
at dinner Anne Kift paid
us a visit, poor girl she
seemed quite annoyed
at coming at dinner hour
quite without reason, for
she thought and rightly
too, that we generally dined
at two. Joseph Carter came
for Uncle Thos after dinner
and Ned went to town.
Polly and I walked down
to the foot of the hill with
Anne on her return. &
have arranged to bathe
