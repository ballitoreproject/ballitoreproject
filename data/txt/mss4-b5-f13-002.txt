My Dear Polly
I received thy very kind Letter of 3 12th from Mt, melick
which was truely sweet and acceptable to me, but why dost thou speak so
diffidently of thy self. Thy communications I anna sure must give
amends pleasure to those who are favourd with these, Therefore please
to make no more porches, but speak thy mind with great freedom to me
in what may open on thy mind & on what thou hast to inform me of
knowing I love thee & all the Family and esteem it a favour to have a
place in your affectionate remembrance & to have a few lines as inclination
or opportunity may favour & I intend doing so my self if it might
be agreeable. I believe my regard for many of my Dear Friends in
your Land will never be erased from my mind, whilst I am favourd
to keep near to, & have my spirit tender,d by, that humbling sweetenning
influence which first drew our minds near to each other. & in which
alone we can breath forth to the Father of Mercies & God of all consolation
& comfort, a petition for the help one after the other. May we dwell here my
beloved Friend & may I frequently be remember,d by you where it fare,s well
with your spirits. We are very poor in this City & not so helpful to one another
as we might be, having very little free & comfortable communication very seldom
seeing one another but at Meeting, and I have a large family & much
Ease to help things in order, & to keep my own mind as feee & disengaged
care to keep things in order, & to keep my own mind as free & disengaged
from remembrances as I wish to do, in a state of deep inward attention
to the voice of the internal speaker that I may distinctly know the Divine
will & receive strength to do it. We are some of us struggling along through

his footsteps as far as they seem enabled & call,d & make no doubt but it will in
some instances. Show my Dear Friend art engaged in a good work, & so are
many other,s amongst you, may it prosper, & may the Blessing of the Almighty rest
upon all that are in any degree willing to give up their time & use the tallents committed
to their trust for the furtherance of the good cause & the help & instruction
of others in that way which seem,s the most clearly to open before them, & this will
be the most effectual way to fill up the chasm made by the removal of those bright
Star,s thou mention,d from these scenes of conflict & trial to their lasting & happy
[unclear][/unclear] in the [unclear]Firmament[/unclear] of the Lords Glory. -- Let us be encourag[insertion]ed[/insertion]
to be faithful in that which is committed to our trust, that we may also receive the
answer of well done good & faithful servant thou hast been faithful over a few things
I will make thee ruler over [unclear]more[/unclear], enter thou into the Joy of thy Lord.
My kind Love to J [unclear]Gatchel,s[/unclear] family and those Friends who
remember with Love thy Affectionate Friend
Elizabeth Bevington

great discouragements But our consolation is that the Lord Beholds the
Children of Men in their different states & trials in this the House
of our pilgrimage & as through all, & under all, we look up to Him as our
Father who is in Heaven & petition Him for that portion of Bread that
He sees meet to give for our sustainance & renewed strength that in His
Time we shall receive, &, more over, that all our varied trials the deep & humbling
shall be made subservient to His will, & answer some good purpose
knowing that all things shall shall work together for good to those who fear &
& love God. - My Dear Friend thou art very kind to set
store by my Letters, I would have sent as it was thy request, the fragment
wrote at Spring mount but I had burnt it. I was very sorry when I returnd
to Ballitore not to find thee thare, It felt as blank to me as tho I had
been long used to be thare myself, as thou was brought very near [unclear][/unclear] spirits
& thy kindness & sympathy to, & with me in [insertion]my[/insertion] poor & weak state was [unclear]true[/unclear]
comfortable & refreshing. My Dear Girls took thy notice of [unclear]them[/unclear]
yea very kind. I would have had Polly wrote a few lines to thee in the [unclear]freedom[/unclear]
but she could not well get over the difficulty of writing first to a stranger, perhaps
I should ask to much if I say I should take it very kind if thou would
condescend to give her a line when opportunity offers, as it [insertion]wd.[/insertion] be a great advantage
to her to [insertion]have[/insertion] such a correspondent [insertion]if it was but once in all[unclear][/unclear]while[/insertion] She has a natural turn to poetry
I am sure thou would think her a sweet girl. -- Please to give my
Dear Love to M & Mary Bewley, & A Shannon, I have felt for them &
have thought of saluting them with a few lines but I have little leasure &
as little ability for writing, & frequently think my letters are not worth
my friends acceptance, but frequently remember them with [deletion]with [/deletion] much
affection with tender desires for their preservation & growth in religious experience. -
I was very sorry to hear of the Death of the valuable
John Howard. I wish his removal may stimulate some others to follow
yea very kind, I would have had Polly write a few lines to thee in the fonamdo
