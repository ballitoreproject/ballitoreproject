Clonmel 21 of 2 month 1786

My dear Father,

	I just take up the pen to make a beginning of an epistle to thee, finding a possibility of leisure for a few minutes, & to acknowledge thy very long & equally kind, condescending letter, by which I hope to be instructed, & also my Husband in the education of his Son, he intends to put the Latin Grammer [sic] into his Hands, & try what sort ^of^ a genius he has ^for^ learning, he has ^not^ been much at School this week past, not being in health, feverish & weakley, complained of a sore-throat, when I read thy letter before him, proposing his going on with Latin & French at one time, he set up the pipes, & exclaimed, he could never get so much by heart, he is pretty well now, & was to have gone to School to day, only that ^it^ proved very wet. I was much concerned to hear of my Sisters childs [sic] illness, I sincere^ly^ desire his being restored to his Parents (if consistent with infinite Wisdom) I thought I felt pained on their account as if it was my own thro favour I think our little Eliza is holding up her head again, a little return of health has revived her little spirits, whether this change on that side will be permanent or not I must leave, I have a Hope with thee that the Spring of life & the Spring of the year may help her on, she sleeps & eats well now, & is relieved of the cough, looks pale & is very thin & weak: is beginning to hobble a little about again on her feet; she employs one constantly to attend to her, & is very brittle in her temper, very unlike what she was 6 months ago.
24	I pityed [sic] poor Sally in her disappointment about Samuel Neal, I thought, as thou thinks, that there would be teaching in the dispensation; we must come to be able to say, with one of great experience. I am even as a weaned Child, in many respects I believe, if we make a progress in learning in religion. I am of the belief (but what weight is there in my opinion?) that dear Sally is advancing in this most material knowledge, & that the Master is willing to instruct her in his School, & teach her himself, who teaches (it may well be said,) as never man taught: happy for those who are diligently waiting & watching for this Wisdom at [word crossed out] her Gates: may we all grow rich in this, which is more desirable than any other attainment. I had a letter lately from Sally, it contained an instructive extract from George Dilwins letter to her, yesterday I was highly favoured with a kind letter from dear Mahitable, another to Sally was annexed, which I cut off & forwarded to her, if a private conveyance offers I purpose sending mind for thine & Mothers perusal, & thou wilt be so kind to send it back soon. It was dull to have Mother prevented by illness from attending all the meetings at the quarterly meeting, I hope she is restored to health, this changeable weather is trying to the infirm, I have not seen M: Dudley lately, her two Childrens inoculatio^n^ prevented, ^as I^ have another now to think of about it, her little son was so loaded with a bad pock, that for a time his recovered [sic] was rather dubious in the opinion of some, & her fatigue I suppose has brought illness on herself, that she has been confined since he recovered with a sore throat I think. I hear she is better. My Mother here is very poorly of late, seldom gets out & has a violent cough, especially at night, she looks much broke, is loveing [sic] & agreeable in her manner to me, & to the children. Aunt Taylor rather of her best fashion. Suppose thou hast heard of dear, happy Thomas Rosss disease, & that his remains lie by the side of John Woolmans, I dont hear were John Pemberton is now.
28 I was favoured with my dear Fathers of 22 instant since I scribbled the foregoing, & was much concerned to hear of my dear sisters fresh trial, rejoice that [word crossed out] ^she^ was enabled to bear her loss with such resignation & fortitude of mind, I intend to write to her the first quiet opportunity I can get. It is agreeable to hear of Abrahams excursion, & hope he will receive additional strength thereby, as it is said in an outward sense, is it not so in an inward Use strength, & have it. & is it not similar to this command of the great Masters Occupy till I come. Be faithful in improving the little received, so may we be favoured with an encrease.
I saw Molly Dudley this day, & heard ^her^ to my edification & consolations she I was favoured to sit with her & some others on an appointment was made [sic] to visit Betty Malone previous to her being received into full Membership, ye rather bring us into a serap[seal] by permitting persons in her predicament the privilege of sitting in meetings of discipline, without & now her sister Susy is to come to us, & comes to our Womens meeting, tho her sister was desired to withdraw some time ago: M: Dudleys children are recovered. Thy letter conveyed to me was the first intimation of that pleasing looking union between Jo Harvey & Becky Mark.
	Poor dear Betsy Pim is again disappointed of her visit to you I thought to have sent this by her, Brother Jo spoke of going for Dublin this week, if so I could send this that way, & enclose the letter before mentioned, if not I fear thou wilt think me unmindful of ou. Eliza seems to come on a little, Margaret thrives I think, but a thick rash is come out on ^her^ Body, & runs a little on her shift, & itches her I suppose, as she rubs & twists herself. & I seem to be catching it, what I had best do I am ^at^ a loss I wish for Mothers advice. I am told it is what they call a breaking out, & none of my other child [sic] did so sucking, I fear also for my other five clear little creatures catching it, & if Eliza does I know not how it would terminate, she seems to be cutting the back large teeth, one has appeared, she is full of old chat & little jokes, Debby is exceedingly tender of, & affectionate to hershe takes up most of her time night & day, Margaret another girl, so that we have our hands full, but I am thankful if they are spared to me, & look forward for their assistance, may they be favoured with that fear that preserves from snares, & never bring dishonour on the society of which they are Members by birth.
3 month 2 	I have expected private conveyance for this in vain, & therefore conclude to send it by post this evening, it is a strange sort of letter. Poor dear Anna Taverner what ups & downs you have about her, this is trying weather for her. Becky desires me to say she got Mollys letter & the gloves, & is obliged to her, she has a letter written this some time past waiting for a private hand, I cant [sic] find there is any packet here for thee as thou mentions, Betsy Pim received thine this day. Tom Chaylor desires his love to thee, says Abraham must learn latin. Sam joins me in dear love to thee Mother & you all.
I am thy affectionate Margaret Grubb

I hope to hear of Abrams return safe, & that he is pleased with his journey; sister was more easily alarmed than I should be (I think) in similar circumstances.
