2nd mo 1825
My dear E - thanks for thy kind note
of enquiry - I do not think we suffer'd
at all by our journey but since we
came home the children caught heavy
colds & we are obliged to confine them
to the Nursery - tell my aunt S that
I call'd to enquire for Robt Foyle's child
& Robert told me he was rather better
that his amendment is very slow -
I have heard nothing of Doctor Hervey's
child since my return not having time
to go to Wm street - I send by the carman
a parcel which was left here for my
Mother, a coat which I would thank thee
to give to my nurse I told her I would
send it to thee for her & some things
for Deborah I intend to have them all
put in a bag for her & will pay the
carriage so thou need not, thy muslin
cost 2/10 - 15 d per yd 2 1/4 yds

I recd my mother's letter to day, I intend sending
her what is order'd, did you get J Wilkinson's
book? I sent it along with Arcadia
I'm glad to hear good news of J Fisher & Abby
Wright, I return the gloves, perhaps they belong
to M White, Becky Pim died of inflammation
on the lungs I hear suddenly
Doctor Harvey's child is released
poor Maggie has a frightful cough
J Williams brought thy letter & cash
thou sent 3d too much which I return
please send
the receipt

I fear I
cannot get
the pieces
of Cotton
for my
mother by
weight
