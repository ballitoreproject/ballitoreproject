Decr 18th 1810
Your letter my dear Friend has remained
unanswered much longer than I intended Indeed every
time I opened my work box I was reminded of writing
to you but having a great variety of occupations, & company
to attend to I cannot always find leisure to write to a
friend - [insertion]as often as I would wish.[/insertion] I hope you will excuse my long delay, & I will
promise more punctuality in future. My Father
told me he had written to A Shackleton respecting Lee's.
I have not much hopes that Betsy will succeed in
her new manufacture. Fashion you know is capricious,
and as the goose down tippets were fashionable two
years ago, I fear Betsy cannot depend on that manufacture
for employing her girls - Do not however think
that I wish to discourage her. I only wish her not
to be too hasty in adopting a manufacture that entirely
depends on the uncertainty of fashion - I wish very
much to hear about her straw plait, & her school I
have got 4 machines on a new construction for splitting
straw, which I intend sending with the next
magazines to Carlow.
Our school is in a very flourishing condition,
& I hope we have improved the girls in some respects.
pity you had no brains."
I have been reading the Memoirs of
Madame de Stahl - It is a very strange book, & gives a curious
description of the manner of the French nation during the reign
of Lewis 15th When I have a little leisure I intend making out a
little biographical sketch of her life for the magazine - I do not
admire her character very much; she was too apt to [underline]fall in love[/underline],
but she had good qualities which over-balanced her failings - My Father
says her love fits are extremely entertaining & that I should not
let that prevent me from giving a biographical sketch of her
character. Indeed I think I could not think highly of any woman
who was ready to fall in love with every one & who would think
[deletion]it [deletion][/deletion] proper to tell people she loved them - I like women to respect
themselves - I am sorry that I cannot tell you that I have
settled with the Belfast booksellers. I wish Betsy had read
Patriotic sketches; I think it is much better than any thing that
Miss Owenson ever wrote - Ben Haughton marked several passages
that he admired, & I think he shewed his taste - but you know
I was extremely partial to him - Tell Betsy to be very careful of
his letters, as I would not wish to lose them - When she comes to
Lisburn I will show her more of his letters -
Miss Owenson is publishing a novel entitled the Missionary, &

We find it impossible to have any rules for the school,
as childrens dispositions are so extremely different;
more than half of our girls are from 14 to 20 years of
age, & they are extremely easy to manage - I anticipate
great pleasure in showing our school to Betsy next
summer & often remind her of her promise - My
charming companion [underline]Hope[/underline] always flatters me with
the expectation of her visit.
My Father has had a long letter from his friend
E Rushton, & as I think you would like to hear from
him I shall make a short extract - He says, "Should
I ever again set foot on your shore it would give me
great pleasure to pass sometime under your roof;
this however is not likely to take place as I am now
more confined than ever, my poor wife from a rheumatic
affliction has not been able to walk for more
than 12 months past, & whether she will ever again
enjoy that pleasure it is hard to say. If I have any
partiality for the men of Ireland, & you think I have,
it is not merely because I have a little Irish blood
in my veins, but it is because they have been long an
oppressed people, & if I do not esteem my own countrymen,
it is because they are not only the oppressors of
mankind, but because their foot-steps in every region
have been sprinkled with human blood - I know it will
we are to be favoured with a portrait of herself - Will you think
that I read books that are unfit for me, when I tell you that I
have been delighted reading George Enson's new publication on National
government? He treats of the advantages & disadvantages of
monarchical & democratical forms of government, & then gives
his own plan which is very excellent, but I think impracticable -
We are all very well; my Father is just gone to bed after
writing part of the political retrospect of politics, & has left me
some proof sheets to correct - William is reading Cobbett, & Betsy
& Ellen are in a great fuss making [underline]taffy[/underline]. Robert has not been
at home for a week past, he is attending the linen markets.
He is at Newry today, & will not return home until next
week - I have been telling him that he was extremely shy in
not writing to G Shackleton, but he sprained his wrist, which
made writing very painful - I send a large packet of [underline]love[/underline] but
it is not worth distributing, so you may dispose of it as you please
for your ever sincerely affectionate - SH

be said it is wrong to censure a people merely for the
acts of their government, but as the great mass of
the British people are the advocates & supporters of
their government, they of course partake of the guilt,
& share the censure - If patriotism is to supersede justice;
if the wealth & power of one nation cannot be supported
without the pillage & slavery of others, then the
names of Patriot & Plunderer ought to be synonymous."
The excellence of these sentiments must be my apology
for making a long quotation - Because I approve of
such noble sentiments do not think I am a politician;
& even if I had leisure I would not admire such a pursuit -
I am highly interested about Ireland, & I like to
read the newspapers sometimes, but should not wish
to do more -
Mr. Trotter does not seem to have given up
hopes of literary fame - I heard that he intended publishing
something on the Catholic question, & a tour thro'
Flanders, France & Holland in company with Mr. Fox - if
the latter book is ever published I think it must be
interesting - Mr. Trotter has frequently talked to me about
his journey, but he seemed at that time very unwilling
to write on any subject relating to Mr. Fox -
My Friend Betsy Johnston, for whom you so kindly enquire,
continues recovering, tho' very slowly - I fear she will
never recover her former strength. Her spirits are excellent;
I am rejoiced at her recovery as she has long been one of

my most intimate friends - I hope your invalids are quite
recovered; we are anxious to hear how Lydia White is -
Has the Angel returned to Ireland yet? I intended
writing to Deborah but I have not left room, I will
write soon. - She & I are not singular in differing in
opinion respecting the merits of Scott's poetry, as I think
I have seldom [deletion]ever[/deletion] heard such a variety of opinions on
any trifling subject - one of my acquaintances said to me,
"Have you seen Scott's delightful poem, indeed it is
absolutely divine" - a very few hours after [deletion]if[/deletion] I was asked
if I had taken up my time reading Scott's nonsense, "for
I assure you," said my friend, "I can call it by no other name,
his poetry always reminds me of the fable of the fox &
the mask, when the fox exclaims pretty face it is a
