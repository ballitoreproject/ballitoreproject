My Dear Thomas
I enclose first half of the bill [insertion]dated 26 inst[/insertion] at twenty
one days of Bank of Ireland on Bank of England for thirty
pounds No 2116. The remaining half I intend sending forward
on Monday if I can prevail on any one to assist me
in filling a 2nd sheet against that time, if not I
will post it on [deletion]Monday[/deletion] [insertion]Tuesday[/insertion] letter or no letter. We are all
well here except poor Richard junr who appears to be no
better than when you left, he feels much easier when in
bed, and remains there almost entirely these last few
days, he is at present at Fassaroe, Edward never
tells any particulars about him and the other boys here
seem to know no more than myself. I suppose you
and E have seen great variety since you appear to
have made numerous acquaintances on yr journey, how you
managed it I dont know, but certainly not by going
to sleep or reading in the steam Carriages, you have
made such advances in that respect, that I do not
despair of seeing you come home with a cigar
or Meerschaum in full operation, only think what a triumph
that would be to Manliffe & Fred [deletion]not[/deletion] [insertion]and[/insertion] to [deletion]mention[/deletion] another
 individual who shall be nameless. Thos [unclear]Keft[/unclear] opened
what letters came from you and says there is nothing
particular in them, there have been very few enquiries for
you and they have been refered to Mr [unclear]Keft[/unclear]. -

Since writing on the other side I find
that Edward and Willy have nearly filled the
sheet and as it is now nearly post hour
I must conclude with kind regards to all
not forgeting the message I gave you for
Berry when setting out, hoping you may
enjoy yourselves while away and return safe
and sound to yr old home. -
I remain yours
affectionately

My dear aunt,
I was glad to hear you were getting on so
well. perhaps it is almost as amusing and I am sure
must be more strange to be travelling amongst people
whose language is unintelligible, that among those with
whom you can converse freely and make yourself but for
the variety of scenery, the same as at home. Tell uncle
Thomas I executed both his little commissions for him &
have the valued knife safe in my drawer. I hope he did
not keep his threat of not taking you to see the "Ariadne",
those chef d'oevres of the masters are not to be passed carelessly by
even tho' the beholders may have no taste to admire nor skill to

appreciate their beauties. The state of this unhappy country
is becoming more appalling. Famine not alone stalks ahead
but pestilence with its desolating breath follows in her wake.
The best antidote for the former is industry. for the latter. courage.
Had the poor Irish known this, the deaths would not
be as they are beyond counting. Dick is only middling, the
rest pretty well, I spent a few days in Dunlavin and enjoyed
myself much more than I expected. Pray remember me
kindly to the Doctor & family and to Mrs Evans & Mary. Hoping
you will continue to enjoy your travels I am
Your affectionate nephew
William L Barrington

My dear Thos & Eliza
You will like to hear how
we get on here and at Fassaroe, here the boys
are well & [insertion]all[/insertion] business dull except in the relief [unclear]&[/unclear]
pro[unclear][/unclear] time. there is a panic in the [unclear]Indian[/unclear]
corn trade and the price has fallen nearly
20% per quarter. Potatos are making their
appearance again in many of the county markets
[deletion][/deletion] Fassaroe News but a dull acct to
give. Poor Richard is very weak, I think
moreso than he was at all. Hes a trooper
[unclear][/unclear] to sit up and [unclear][/unclear] after his patience
and courage, he will have a hard struggle
of it. Remember much [underline]fondly[/underline] to Bessie and
tell I often think of them [unclear][/unclear] [unclear][/unclear] when
she offered to come with me to Gretna yours affectionately
in heart
