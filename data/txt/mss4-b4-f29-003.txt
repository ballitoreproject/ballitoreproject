was at Stramore, we used to corrospond,
why dont we now? How is
Mary Haughton and the little
child,? thou'rt very fond of little
Children, as soon as their heads
are firm between their shoulders,
My Mother was ill yesterday, but
she is better now. Agnis's letter came
very apropos this morning, her poor
Father was blind for two week's, they
were afraid he would never see again
but he will be able I expect to see
the wedding ring on Agnes's finger.

My Mother intends bringing [insertion]one[/insertion] to Carlow
next monthly meeting, to see Lucy
and William present. Will thou
give my love to Samuel and Mary
Haughton. did Sam make any verses
since, I wish thou would answer.
this letter, and as it is short, thou
can make up for it by writing a
long one, this is cold weather I pity
thee if thou has chilblanes, farewell
my dear Aunt, I remain thy affectionate
Niece DL
