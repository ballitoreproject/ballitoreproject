My Myrtle [unclear]dear[/unclear]. I will give her another perhaps. -
His Majesty's [unclear]Mortar Bury[/unclear] Charges.
Cadiz Bay, 29th [unclear]Rett. 12.[/unclear]
Dear Mrs. Leadbeater.
Whether to address you or no, I have [underline]long[/underline] hesitated;
however as you have been the writer of the Letter which I have just received,
I shall hesitate no longer.
You & all old friends must perceive that I am
always anxious & happy to hear from you on them, but I must now certainly
say, - that at the same time that this Letter convey'd to me that
species of happiness, which every one in my opinion ought to Covet; -
lessen'd it very much, on reading that part giving the account
of the Death of that once amiable & virtuous friend - Lydia White!
How often have I attempted to write & send her a present as a keepsake.
More particularly so in Septr. 1810 - but something that was
then absolutely necessary always prevented me. - Her Brother
Richrd.. knows how [underline]very[/underline] partial I was to her. - She carried always
such a kind benificent look, & so truely Amiable in all her
Actions, - that altho' I was then unable to distinguish between
good & bad, - I felt such pleasure when in her Company, that nothing
could ever obliterate, & which has often since afforded me again
in thinking of her. - I must ever remember the [underline]last[/underline] [underline]walk[/underline]
I had with her & some schoolmates. - it was in the four tree field & up
about the 9th Tree Hill, gathering wild strawberries in our way. -
- It was a day, of pleasure to me I never can or shall expect to
see again. - To this day I have the contents of a Letter which I
attempted to write her at the above time, but was prevented
by an unforeseen accident. -

Mrs. White, & all who knew her, may well regret her untimely end,
but then they ought still to be happy in the Contemplation of having
once had such an example of Moral goodness. - How Serenely
Calm must their last hour be, - who can look back on the Actions
of their past Life with pleasure, & leave this world without a sigh -
That is the only happiness poor Mortals ought to be ambitious
to obtain; instead of that however they substitute Riches
Titles, & Honours, - the pageant of a day. ---- I join with you
in hoping & further in believing that she now enjoys unmix't
pleasure or rather happiness - & may all that know her & [underline]Many More[/underline]
enjoy it also - [underline]hereafter.[/underline]
Believing you to be divested of that fashionable but infamous
vice - Affectation, that altho' I have said so much in her favour
but at the same time truely my belief; - I shall not think
that you will suppose me guilty of it [underline]here[/underline]. - I am a Sailor. -
I must now at last with unfeigned sorrow give over that
once happy Idea of seeing poor Lydia. - Her memory however
can never be effaced from mine but by death. - May her
Infant find a Father & Mother in you all. - That however I do
not doubt. - If I live to see you again, - I shall view it with
that pleasure that I always did it's Mother. - Within these
last 6 weeks I have received an account of the death of my
much loved Father on the 22nd. July last by a Stroke of the Palsy.
I am very little Inclin'd to write, but your Letter I must
acknowledge. - My thoughts are entirely taken up in the hopes
(but they are feignt.) of visiting Ireland to see my dear remaining
Parent, which was always in common with the other most
dear to me. -
Your Letter certainly surprised me much by hearing
of Deborah's [insertion]being[/insertion] married; I thought she was rather young for the married
state. - I wish them happy however. - Altho' [underline]Elizabeth[/underline] & I
were particular friends, - you have not mention'd her, - your
last account leaves her at Mount Mellic School. -
I [insertion]am[/insertion] most certainly gratified to hear that poor Abby & Becky
are well. - I long to see her. - [underline]Sally[/underline] Shackleton our
old [unclear]intimate[/unclear] & my good friend you have also neglected, -

as well as Mary Dickinson. - [unclear]Glazeler oak's[/unclear] part, I still recollect
Thos. [unclear]Book[/unclear] is also left out. - You see I recollect everything. - The
thought of seeing you yet, passes away many a Mid ship & watch, &
otherwise dreary hour. - May my expectations be realiz'd soon. -
The seal of your Letter has a destroy'd it much. -
Happy in finding that I am yet remember'd by you & the rest, as
also in finding you well; I shall conclude as it is now nearly
11 o-clock P.M. & my Light just expir'd. - To Morrow we sail
for Alicante, with Cloathing & Ammunition for our Army, there
Employ'd in carrieing on this war, which has [underline]never[/underline] been guided
by [underline]Humanity[/underline], either by the [underline]Invaider or Invaided[/underline].
I remain Dear Mrs Leadbeater
Your Affte & old friend
Jas. [underline]Aurenham[/underline] Graydon
P.S. I forgot to desire or rather request you would give my
Love to [underline]all[/underline], & to inform Richrd. Shackleton, that when I am
in a good Humour for writing I shall certainly write to
him. - We remain'd in the Guadiana until 25th Septr. then
went to Gibraltar to refit, & return'd yesterday.
I am heartily tir'd of the Impious& Cowardly Spaniards. -
There is [unclear]no[/unclear] general rule, [underline]without[/underline] exceptions.
The expence of Postage is I know very great, but I trust you
will excuse it, & answer me this [underline]as soon as the last[/underline].
I cannot see very well by candle light.
Where is John Jonson my old school mate.
Adieu!
