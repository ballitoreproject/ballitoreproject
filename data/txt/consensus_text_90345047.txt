I went out after dinner
to buy some things at
Todds for Lilly, where
I returned - found
that the shop man
had given me two
pair of gloves instead
of one, so had to march
back again with the
other pair. Margt
and Huldah went
to pay a visit to Anna
Pim Joshua Pim's wife
who is now lodging
at the Shelbourne Hotel
but found her out;
also Rebecca Malcolmson,
Papa and Huldah went
out after tea Margt. who
