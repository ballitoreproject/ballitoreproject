My dear Friend
I cannot say I was
[underline]huffed[/underline], but I was [underline]miffed[/underline]
that so steady, & so highly
respected a friend as I have
always esteemed you should
have been some days in
Carlow at Christmas without
coming to see me, but
the bustle of the meeting,
the dirt of the street, &
many other &c &c &c presented
themselves to my mind,
& to show that all [unclear][/unclear]
that feeling has long since
faded away, I write principally
to say that I have
to the last - heavenly -
his sharpest pang was
what he felt for me, &
ever there, I was his comforter
his disorder was be
cruelly rapid; it deceived
us both, I took it, & so did
he for Anasarcha, but
it was water upon the
chest - He died at last
somewhat suddenly upon
my arm - I was his sole
nurse, his attendant, his
comforter - He was very
often engaged in mental
prayer - His continual
sweet endearing "Thank thee
Nanny" is a remembrance
that will in time soothe
my aching heart & turn these tears to
rapture - At present I am a buried
seed in whose sharp joint peace bleeds
& hope expires, but I have the [unclear]blessed[/unclear]
peace, the holy calm which the circumstance
of having always served
him with all the [unclear][/unclear] [deletion]of[/deletion] [insertion]that[/insertion] love &
veneration inspired - but he was no
common example of christian excellence
His will resigned itself to the will

had a letter announcing
the death of my dear &
venerable friend Mr. Hoalbrooke -
this announcement
I had about a month
ago, & a few days since
I had a letter from Mrs.
Hoalbrooke - As I know you
felt interested about him,
I shall give you a short
extract from her letter -
"He is gone, my dearest
Mrs. H-, & I feel prouder,
(bereaved as my situation
is) of being his wife,
the helpmeet & I believe this
world [unclear][/unclear] - Tho'
this house is the [unclear][/unclear] of
departed happiness, the
path of duty lies clear
before me, & my soul will
now turn from the creature
to his Creator - I loved &
honored your friend almost
to idolation - For
22 years I corresponded
with him, & formed my
character as nearly as
I could upon his model -
I was 20 years younger
than him, but I had bad
health, & his was such a
[unclear]peer[/unclear] old age, I expected
many happy years of
comfort with him - his
faculties were all perfect
his endearing tenderness
