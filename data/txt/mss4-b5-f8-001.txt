To Mary Leadbeater,
Being about to publish a little
book, in which I have occasion to make
mention of [underline]Leonard Fell's [unclear]rencontro[/unclear][/underline]
[underline]with the Highwayman[/underline] - I am necessitated
to apply to thee for information respecting
that little circumstance [underline]&[/underline] the [underline]sources[/underline]
[underline]whence it comes[/underline]. I have seen it somewhere -
I think in print - before. I [unclear]messilt[/unclear]
it in thy Extracts & origl. anecdotes
for youth" - but am totally at a loss
where to apply except to thyself.
Thou wilt oblige me not a little by
as speedy a reply to this [underline]as possible[/underline], as
my piece will be gone to the press perhaps
even before this reaches thee.
I am with regard they Frnd.
See the Postscripts John Barclay.

P.S. I thought it [underline]hardly fair[/underline] to say this
much without letting thou know the title
& design of the work. Per "[underline]Select Anecdotes,[/underline]
& design of the work. It is "[underline]Select Anecdotes,[/underline]
& other instructions incidents taken from
the printed Writings of Frds, chiefly illustrations
of their sentiments & practice
under various circumstances of life"
IF does contain one or two anecdotes
w.h I see also in thy little "Extracts"; but
this thou wilt scarcely make objection to
seeing that the design & [underline]sphere[/underline] of
each is so different - this being for
children - mine on a difft. scale &
likely to fall into tho hands of [deletion][/deletion][insertion]many[/insertion]
[underline]out[/underline] of the Soc? as well as those of all
classes in it, I shod. guess.
