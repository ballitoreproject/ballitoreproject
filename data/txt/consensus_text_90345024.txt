dined with us, so
Arthur brought her
home at about 11 1/2 -
O'clock I really think
it was. or near it,
then we staid chatting
and were not in bed
I think till near twelve
12th.. A lovely morning
Polly and I went out
to Monks town the fine
weather and to be together
tempted me altho'
I had not intended
going, as Maria and
Josephine were going
to spend the day at
Samford, I did not
Sanford, I did not
so much mind
another day
