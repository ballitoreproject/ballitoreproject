My dear Elizth
I tried to day for the rollers which I find
I cannot get for less than 10/- I do not know
why I was told 6/- when I tried before but tho
I went to the same place they said they could
not give good ones for less than ten that I
might get them for 7/- but they would [unclear][/unclear]
[unclear]be[/unclear] season'd so what am I to do -
I am to see J Downes the day after tomorrow
& mean to pay him for my mother's paper
tell M L I have bought her slop bowls but do
not know how to send them indeed I think
if [deletion][/deletion] any man comes to town with potatoes
you might tell him to come here & I will
send my mothers paper a basket I have of yours
& Mary's bowls & the annual monitor if I can
get it I would thank thee to buy me some
eggs suppose they cost 1d a piece I wish to have
When you kill your pigs, I would be very glad to
buy a crock of Lard but I will not take it on any other
terms

some for my father who stays mostly in town
now, we are to remain here all the winter
so far as we know & the Glen family stays in
the country - Margt.. grows very hardy & stomps
about finely with the help of our hands
did I ever tell thee I was obliged for the shifts they
will fit her if she lives in a year or two hence
they shall be made no other way than that thou
directed. How does RSL look in his tree house
& who is with him? please tell him to send
me along with the flour a cwt of wheat meal
whole meal to make bread
Elizth.. Leadbeater
Ballitore
if it be good & [unclear]would[/unclear] keep well I would like a
whole cwt & [unclear]would[/unclear] thank him to pay for the
carriage &
charge it to
me & send
a bill of the
whole
with love to
all thy SB
I shall take
great care
of your letter
poor Thos W
I am sorry his
quiet little house
should have
been molested
my mother's
letter was
very acceptable
