I pass weeks without seeing any but
my own family, even as acquaintances
and as intimates I have few out of its
pale- Of those of early youth and I once
had many, most are either snatched away
by death, or have faded into mere acquaintances
by time or distance, while the pleasures
of my own circle, the refined manners, incomparable
tempers, miscellaneous knowledge, and
affectionate [deletion][/deletion] [insertion]attentions[/insertion] of my husband and son
added to the playful graces of my younger
boys give me a kind of distaste for general
society - increased by a state of health, just
[underline]so[/underline] delicate (and no more) as not to bear crowded
rooms, long and late dinners, studied dress
restraint, or fear of life and limb in carriages
at the doors of those [underline]assemblies[/underline] where the
cursings and imprecations of the coachmen
quarrelling for precedence, the resounding flogging

of what for the moment I consider as the
nobler animal of the two, and the screams
real or affected of the young ladies give a
very happy image of Pandemonium, not to
mention the real dangers to most constitutions,
of a transition from extreme heat to
extreme cold in a chilling winter [underline]morning[/underline]
for even the most regular can hardly
ever leave a place of amusement except
the theatre till after midnight, if they mean
to accomplish any of the purposes for wh.
they go - In these two [insertion]last[/insertion] points I speak only
of London. In Bath amusements are obtained
on easier terms, but even there
I left home but on [deletion]four[/deletion] [insertion]few[/insertion] [/insertion] evenings and
seldom remained absent from thence
above an hour - You see you [underline]have[/underline] led
me into Egotism, as you seem to wish.
Since I am embarked on that "sea without
a shore" - I must reply to your questions
about [unclear]Melesina[/unclear] the less- who is a large

strong [insertion]plump,[/insertion] placid, blackeyed girl, without a single mark
of delicacy or irritability - she seems to like everything
that happens to her, and is just the creature
I could have prayed for -
