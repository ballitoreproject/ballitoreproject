Norwich 10th 11th month 1782


I am alarmed when I recollect that by waiting for matter to occur worthy of thy attention, my dear Cousin! I may perhaps deprive myself of the valuable privilege with which thou hast kindly indulged me, if thou can portray that state, in which grateful diffidence produces silence; thou wilt feel an apology for me, & I trust not allow me to suffer longer from my own supineness
        Though thy favour is of distant date I cannot let the interesting contests pass unnoticed, I am delighted with the lively description of thy House mayst thou be the father of a chosen & obedient Tribe! I cannot help lamenting that my cousin Peggy [word crossed out] should feel the [work crossed out] ^weight^ of so much care, so close is the union that the constant activity of the body, and close attention ^to^ sensible objects, does most uncomfortably fetter & perplex the mindMy lovd Debbys happiness is highly pleasing to meI am sorry that Abram & Lydia have had to experience the reduction of their little flockpray assure them of my sincere regard & good wishes I should be glad to to be within reach of information from thy son tomorrow if the day will admit of our observation of Mercury in his passagelittle Hudson (who is still my Pupil) Thirsts for Cosmographical knowledge I am not only obliged as Rousseau says, to utter these humiliating words I dont [sic] know but to lament that there is not one person in our circle capable of satisfying his enquiries
My dear Mother (by the account I had 4 days since) suffers even more than usual from ^the^ coldness of the weather, our Eliza is I hear grown Fat, I hope ere long to draw in my chair amongst them at Tottenham even the anticipation of it gives me joy - before this month elapses I expect to move with the Children [paper folded] YoungsburyI hope Priscy [?] Gurney will [obscured by seal] our party there; she tells me she saw thee, at Red Lion square, I could wish that you knew each other better I feel that she will very shortly take me captive
        How very comfortable it is that my dear Aunt Pike is yet spared to us!My most respectful regard waits thy good wifes acceptance & my dear love thy daughters [sic]
                Thy very affectionate
                        CousinHannah Pim


Friends Gurney, Oxley, Lindo &c:
