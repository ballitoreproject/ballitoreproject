Ballitor 6 mo 22nd 1826
My dear Sarah
I do not feel easy with
out letting have a line about
thy dear Mother, though I dare
say thy other friends have written thee
of her, I must say though unwillingly
that I did not think her case so alarming
at all as at present, she
seems extremely low and weak,
and the swelling getting up, within
a few days it has got to her hands
and arms, though not so much in other
parts, I did not hear what the Doctor
said of her last night, but Winny Doyle
thinks the change pretty considerable.
Do not my dear Sarah think it
Thy Aunt Sally
is away so I think thou could
have her room and I would not have thee lose
time in coming

heard it casually - I will try to send
this by one of the coachmen - farewell
thy very affectionate friend
Abby Wright .
unkind of me writing thus to thee, it is
just doing as I would be done by -
I would not wish Elizabeth to know I
have written, thou need not say but thou
S Wright will please have
this forwarded without delay
To be left at
John Wright's
10 Skinner Row
for Sarah Barrington
186 Gt Britain St
Dublin
