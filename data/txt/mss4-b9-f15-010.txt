Dear Sarah,
I think it would be
paying no great compliment to thy
honesty in returning me M. S's letter,
to write thee a note, as a [underline]reward[/underline] for
it; but as I had intended, if I had
not received the aforesaid letter before
this, to write thee a note [underline]for[/underline] it,
I think I may as well do so
now-- James Henry is in my
room at present, reading the third
volume of Cowper, he came to see
the Installation. I expect E. A.
& J. Taylor - Well, I went to
Claremont on seventh day, it
is a most beautiful place. The

house is large & contains a great number
of small rooms. - It commands a
fine & extensive view of the surrounding
country, in which view is
included a distant prospect of the
bay of Dublin. - There is a stream,
or river as you would call it in the
country running through the town, over
which is a wooden-bridge, and on
which was a swan until it was
sold by auction for £ 6, Orpen bid
as high as £5..19..6 for it. He was
thru when I was, at the auction of
furniture, buying for the Society &
for Joseph Humphreys. - They are to
furnish two rooms & a kitchen for
him Thou hast sent to Dublin
to know what is wisdom - Con[unclear][/unclear]
Solomon's [deletion]first[/deletion] proverbs, & thou will
find several beautiful descriptions
of her there. Why do we call
Wisdom she? - Is [underline]she[/underline] not as
common among our sex? - Hast
thou read any of Chalmers or
Roscoe yet? If so, write me
a note on them. But some of
you are going to the county Wicklow,
what part of it pray? - James
Henry says that Cowper would make
a good hand at describing the bustle
in the street at present.- [unclear]En [/unclear]
William Doyle. - Exit from thy
presence Thomas Fisher - -
