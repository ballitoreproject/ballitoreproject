M: Leadbeater
Beloved Friend
Thy affectionate & cordial enquiry after my state
of health was very acceptable, have been mostly very poorly
since the morning thou & Co: Mary Doyle were kind enough
call here; I took a variety of prescriptions, by the advise of
one frd. or other, amongst which was that of thine, also those
of the faculty, but none seem'd to reach the complaint, so as
to afford much relief - the day I recd. thy letter (i think) the
complaint seem'd to get to the height or crisis, & Nature seem'd
that Night to make an effort for mastery, a fine perspiration
came on, & being assisted a little by some outward means - it
continued, till it produced a material change for the better.
I am at present i hope in a mending way, but weak, & greatly
reduced in my flesh - I have it in prospect to go to Ballitore
so that I am willing to hope thy dream may turn out literally
true. - Thy remarks respecting the removal of dear Mary
Bewley very pertinent, i thought her a very amiable young
woman, & some few years back an orniment to our Society - I have
recd. some hard raps from susy, but feel no resentmt. or
dislike to her on that acct. Perhaps I deserved them, & so
far as I feel sensible thereof am willing to give them full
place & scope in my mind - I was wishing to hear how
Abm's complaint was. & am glad thou mention'd it.
I am not conscious, of having ever shew'd any other conduct
to thy Dear Father, & his family in the offspring line & their
connections, than that, of an affectionate attachmt. so far as
I knew how, when opportunitys turn up - & it has been a pretty
severe tryal upon [insertion]me[/insertion] to be shut out as I have been from the company
of those I formerly delighted in - my dear Love to Wm.
in which my wife & other branches of the family join -
Thy Friend
Josh. Williams

Abm. some time ago lent me a pamphlet, I return'd it by E. Barrington
& wrote a few lines, & put them in the book - perhaps they are lying
there still - my dear love to him & Lydia
