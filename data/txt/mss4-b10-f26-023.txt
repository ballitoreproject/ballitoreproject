Paris Hotel Wagram June 7th 1850
My dearest Mother Well here we are in Paris & in one of the very
pleasantest situated Hotels overlooking the Gardens of the Tuilleries
We left London yesterday at 12 oclock by the Brighton railway and
stopped at Croydon to see Florence - we left our luggage at the Station
house & walked up to Mary Mason's - Florence was delighted to see us &
she & Emy had great enjoyment in each others company during a walk
we took in the neighbourhood when we returned to MM's she had tea ready
for us & we got on in very good time to Dover last night - we at once on
board the Calais packet - which was to sail at 11 oclock on the arrival of
the express train from London - we took a meal supper & some ale on onboard
as the most likely way to keep us from being sick - which seemed to have the
desired effect as all the ladies [insertion]but one[/insertion] & some of the Gentlemen were sick & we were
not - we got to Dover after rather a rough passage about 1/2 past one and
got with the help of a "commissionaire" as quickly as possible to the Rail
way & travelled all night arriving here this morning
about ten oclock after all delays of custom house officers
&&& - we have two pleasant bedrooms [insertion]in[/insertion] one of which
we take our meals - but I do not know whether we shall
remain here as it is an expensive place - we have just
had our tea which was very refreshing having walked about
a great deal - but did not go to any exhibition yet - wishing first to
become acquainted with the town & its places & buildings which are
very fine - but it is nothing at all to London in people & vehicles
[underline]nor stir[/underline] - we have got on so far pretty well with the [underline]little[/underline] french
we know & having a waiter who speaks a [underline]little[/underline] English - Emy
does not seem to like Paris near so well as London but I think
she is in some degree determined not to like it as well however we
are scarcely long enough here to form a good opinion about it
& her Uncle brought her through a good many of the inferior streets
We are going out again awhile before bed time to look at the people in the
Gardens but were anxious to send you a few lines that you might
know what we were about - you can let mother know about us [deletion]as[/deletion]
it is not worth while writing to both when you are so near and
Emy has the rest of the paper to write to her mamma - she cannot

post this until tomorw but as we have a deal to see we must
try & economize our time & it breaks in on the day to sit down to write
letters after breakfast - & you know Thd. nor I do not care to do much
before breakfast - being up all night I have got quite puzzled as to
time & can scarcely believe we only left London yesterday -
8th. June we went out last evening to the Gardens of the Tuilleries and
the Champs Elysee - every one seemed to be there carriages of all kinds
driving in the carriage way of the latter place & the walks thronged
with those on foot besides hundred & might say thousands sitting on chairs
under the trees some at their work - there are besides numerous places of amusement
circusses - merry go rounds - Caffies with an orchestra in which are
both vocal & instrumental music for the people whilst they sip their
coffee. Lemonade &&.. the whole well lighted with lamps had a very gay
appearance - we returned home about ten & were glad to get to bed being
well tired after the days walking & the previous night travelling - we got most
comfortable beds - no annoyance of any kind - we are now just going
to breakfast & will then proceed to see what is to be seen - I there was neither
cold nor dampness in the air last night wh- is the great charm of the climate here
& the great heat has not yet set in - I hope you are well my dear mother and
that I shall find you all so at my return - with dear love to all the dear ones
believe me ever your affectionate daughter EH  Thos & Emy join in love
I will write once more before we leave this
perhaps to Martha - Please send Emy's letter by
first post to Dunlavin - Martha or you might
let them know at Dalkey about us
8 June 4 oclock) we went to the post office to post our
letters & found one from mary Henry which required to be answ
so we had to come all the way back to our Hotel to read one that
was enclosed (from Dr Henry) [unclear]in[/unclear] Mary's - & which Thos. wished
at once to send to mary - we are sorry to hear so dull an acct. from
George Crawford - I wish he would come up to Dublin for advice
I am also sorry to hear that you are perplexed about a
servant - would you venture to get Rose out to do kitchen
work until I go home - she knows how to milk - I would rather
not make any change at [unclear]Glenageary[/unclear] until I go home - Mary
Neale is handy & quick [unclear][/unclear] would require teaching -
