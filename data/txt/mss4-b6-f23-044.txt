My friend, so long, so justly loved
Tho' death sits sadly on thy brow
Meek, placid & benevolent,
Wert thou in life - so look'st thou now.
Unwearied love thy [deletion] spirit cheerd[/deletion] [insertion]suffering sooth'd[/insertion]
Thro' the long, lingering, fatal strife
And soft as falls the autumnal leaf
So closed thy pure unspotted life
O couldst thou see the filial tears
Hear the deep sob of filial grief
Thy heart to melting pity prone
Would pant to minister relief
To change those tears of fond regret
To consolations healing balm
while retrospect of duties paid
Spreads o'er the soul a sacred calm
