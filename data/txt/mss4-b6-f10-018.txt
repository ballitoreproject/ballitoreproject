Ballitore: 7/1 mo: 1810
My very dear Friend,
It was like thy kindness, ancient & new to write to me: I
opened thy letter with dread, but after the perusal my face was covered
with tears of hope, tenderness & gratitude - & in those feelings
all your precious friends here partake. It was so generous to think
of us in thy own distress - but this is nothing new. We rejoice, but we
rejoice with trembling & I hope sometimes we endeavour for resignation:
but what is our sorrow compared with his beloved wife, & with thine,
his dear and tender father? He who afflicts not willingly, will, I trust,
bind up the bruised reed - & if thy venerable head bends over the grave
of the son of thy youth - thou will not sorrow as without hope - thou hast
never & I trust never will experience the scorpion sting which the
misconduct of a child inflicts on a parent's heart. Even from the peculiar
tenderness & acuteness of thy feelings, thy friends can extract
comfort, because these feelings have been so much exercised
for others that they will not prey upon thee as much as the feelings
of those [insertion]do[/insertion] who are only sensible to their own sorrows, & besides

there may be somewhat of a re-payment of sympathy, to
those who can enter into the sorrows of another. I had a letter
this day from Edward Carbutt, which mentioned that dear Ben
was better yesterday - & who knows but those desirable accounts
may continue! I need not say how dearly we love him. If thou
thinks it proper tell him so. I can conceive your meeting - the
attachment between thy dear wife & him displays the character
of mother & son. Would that there were more such women as her &
dear Jane, to whom present our affectionate love & cordial sympathy.
My sister Grubb & Hannah are now here. They purpose visiting
families. All unite in dear love to thee Jane, S & E Eves. Thy
John & Sam Eves well, & are to spend the evening at M & A Doyles
they desire their love. And now, most earnestly wishing that
it may please Providence to restore him who is so dear to us, I
conclude
thy obliged & sincerely affte.. friend
Mary Leadbeater.
