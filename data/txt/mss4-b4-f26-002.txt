I just now recieved my dear sisters letter, and am impatiente
to make some reply, tho my head,& heart are quite destitute of any
thing that can afford thee any pleasure, the good opinion some have
conceived of me, gives both pleasure & pain, self, loves & be thought well
of but if we knen ourselves properly we would not I think be
either cast down, or rose above measure; I often secretly desire to know
myself for I am very certain I am not, as I ought to be in many respect
I hope at times to amend, but repeatly err by unsteadyness, my brother
is not yet gone to town but believe he will go before there gets this
he is to take Albysmare, to his father & to leave it if he gets all
the money, if he gets but twenty pound, the beast is to be fathers
if nothing by all means she is to come back; It will be very
odd indeed if he serves father after all. I join with thee in
writing he may set Johnny a good example & that they may be a
help to one another., I fear father will ask to see thy letter but
hope to put him of with reading part of it; It is his sincere affection
for his children, & desires for our welfare that makes him desirous
to see our letters, I hope his spirit is at time earnest, with his master
or our preservation thro this troublesome would this hope comforts
me at times. I trust his prayer will be heard.
Thou hast told me two peices of news, I did not hear before
W Pike. Samul Rusbet, perhaps that was the cause of
Hannah Greens absenting from Dublin at the meeting time
which if it was it was a poor one, If I dare say it, I think her
Cousin Nancy F should not have set her the example. Jane Watson
lay here seven day night, she says that it seems likely, as if
Jo Sandwith will obtain Jenny Wilson, poor Robert was in [unclear]Longton[/unclear]
lately stayed a very short time, I think they say it was to see Jane
Taylor, or some other friend I may be mistaken; very like to chear him
I fear thou [insertion]can[/insertion] not read this if thee can

paper so must did thee farewell all our

dear love as usual

self of having got any good by them, they say he is plain again,
poor man he is much to be pitied. I suppose thou hast got aunts
letter she is rather better to day, she is not confined to just going out
in the chair; Aunt Fuller & Anne Wills give it [insertion]as[/insertion] their oppinion that
it is the gout that aunt has in her stomach, which that say a puke
would be improper for, but aunt Carleton think that the gout
is attended with pain and not sickness, but aunt Fuller seem fully
perswaded that the sickness, & lightness in her head are symptoms
of the gout, & she has advised my aunt to take strong white [unclear]nrn[/unclear]
with tancy infused in it, mother hopes if it be that and they
can get it drove out to her feet or hands, that is may mend her
constitution, however there had best tell W Graham this,
least she should mistake the disorder and prescribe something
improper: Aunt desires thou may not be uneasie, she is lonesome
without thee, & misses thy company greatly; but is willing to
cross her self to serve her friend; I pity thee thou are no doubt
very lonesome but thy good nature, I am sure will make thee
will[insertion]ing[/insertion] to assist thy friends, in their trouble, I wonder we do not
hear from the north, have you heard from Derry-garren
since. My aunt has taken her bees, the two old stoocks
had a good deal of very fine honey; her stilling is over, & we are
now about ours, she has got some coals, but I believe not all
Nanny connerthy conner thy better was out at meeting both forenoon and
afternoon yesterday James has been in Dublin we expect him
home to night, Parish he may come before & send this, that if he
bring thee a letter I may send it I sent thine by him fearing that
if I waited for brother to go, we might miss an opportunity of
sending our letter thine to Betty mine to Hannah, I have got

some Luean show, Aby told me he informed thee of that; I believe
will go towards town tomorrow, he hopes Johnny will meet
him at Vaae to breakfast, Sally's eye rather better, she dips it in cold
water frequently, which believe has been of service to it, my mothers
stomach pretty well, my face has been very indifferent, but seems
rather better at present, it is time and patience that must perfect
the cure, I am sure I sincerely desire the latter, and I think I am [insertion]not[/insertion] quite
as impatient as I used to be, Did my aunt tell thee that Hannah
Piper was delivered of a son?[insertion]had a bad time[/insertion] they heard it when in town, and did
not tell one till other day, I wrote to her and intend sending it by Aby
to Jo Sandwith care, as he and her husband are great friends, and not
thou glad poor Jo in like to succeed? We hear he has offered to take an
house in any part of the Pity, Jenny please, Hann Had soon
used to be cutting Peggy Penrose [insertion]out[/insertion] for him, well I think the cannot
justly brand Sam with being lucrative now, so thou says.
Father & mother would like thou should go to Killrock to
that worthy man, if cousin Hannah or Phebe would go with thee,
else they fear it would not look so prudent; it is a censorious
World, people are [unclear]I very[/unclear] apt to talk, the jaunt would be good for
poor cousin Hannah if she could be prevailed upon to go, it is
dismal for her to be always moping at home; If thou got an in[unclear][/unclear]
on to go to Rorush they would like thou should except of it
I believe thou wilt hardly come home before the six weeks meeting,
fear it will not be fit to leave cousin [insertion]H[/insertion] so soon, mother does not
intend to go to Carlow, but hopes if aunt be fit that she will
go, I have some hopes of going, - thou may be sure I long for thee
to come home, have often thought of thee since: We are much
obliged to cousin Phebe, for her kindness to thee, our love to [unclear][/unclear] Jonathan
[unclear]be che[/unclear]
to dear

we expect cousin Samuel here very soon poor Molly [insertion]Dackett[/insertion] time is lengthen
out, no doubt for a good end, I pity Jenny much fear her health well so
think what a dismal think it must be to as if one of us were in
condition, how it must distress the other. How thankful ought [insertion]I[/insertion] to be
that recovered with my shoulder so surprizingly? I wish never to
forgot I remember one night when I was likely to recover, that I earnest
desired that my hand might forget its cunning & my tongue dove to the
roof of my mouther, before I forget that deliverance from death for [unclear]und[/unclear]
I feared I was near death, I am sure I have not made a good use
my time since that: Poor unfortunate Mccally still confine & with
& am it is very stiff, we hope it is likely to do well, Andrew Willson how
been very [unclear]ke[/unclear] in attending it, the man that set it never came since
Molly [unclear]Now[/unclear] stomach still continues very indifferent [unclear]sheint[/unclear]
to get her [unclear]self & red[/unclear]; sister Molly so obliged for thy letter intends
writing [unclear]soon a[/unclear] frank inclosed I find I am incroaching on [unclear][/unclear]
