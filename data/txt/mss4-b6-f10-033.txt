Carlow 15 Jany 1818
My dear friend
I begin this near eleven O clock to avail
myself of a private opportunity in the morning by P:
Fitzsimmons who kindly promised to call in the morning
for any letters we might have to send to Ballitore
I have just finished two pretty long ones before this &
doubt whether thou wilt be able to read this my
hand & head being tired
I recd thy affectionate letter relative to Mr. Dunn
& regret thou shoud have had so much trouble about
my trifling donation & request the poor grateful
man [deletion]shoud[/deletion] [insertion]will not [/insertion] think of coming to Carlow on so unnecessary
& unmerited a business at least on my part.
I have done nothing but what I ought to do & am already
more than amply paid & request he may [insertion]not[/insertion] say or do
any thing further about it - If I should live till summer
I hope to go with thee to return him thanks for
the pleasure I have received in reading his interesting
narrative -
Before I conclude must express our regrets
that we did not know thy daughter Elizth was in Carlow
'till the day after Mo. meeting & think she ought to
make some apology to us for her omission in not calling
to see us My wife unites wth. me in Dr love to thee Wm. thy
Sister Sally &c Thy Affte friend Sam Haughton

Whats put in a pudding
comes in to the head & goes out in sudden
caprice
P. Fitzsimmons told me Sally desired him to inquire
after our three families I written something on the subject
to James White to communicate to her - and may just
add we are all favd. wth good health Sally Samuel excepted
who still continues very delicate & ailing notwithstanding
she talks of going to the North wth her
husband shortly
