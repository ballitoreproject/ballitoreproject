10th Mt 1820
My dear E - I intend going to Warren's
tomorrow I have got the blades put in thy
White handles the others I did not think
with the expense the mettle knives are
made in England however I have
them still so say shall I go to 10d cost about
them or 8d I paid for the Carving knive 1/8
for the other 10 & scissors 3 in all 2/9 the
new knives would cost 1/8 a piece at least
new carving knive 4s/- can I do any thing
else for thee? say so by Edw who
is to be the bearer of this Mary & I saw
tolerably good cloking for 3/9 per yd.
2 yds wide say shall we get some

& happy I saw Harriet lately. she was
very well & expects Lyssy very soon
