My dear Father

	I could not but feel a great vacuum after I parted you, & the addition of the absence of my Husband, but I was much consoled by the favourable circumstances of your having the benefit of a very fine day; & every matter considered I think it was the most prudent step, & I cheerfully relinquished my own gratification for your ease. Jack Par returned & conveyed the pleasing account of your proceeding so far satisfactorily, I went to meeting, & after meeting broke up called in to Fathers, your sudden departure occasioned some surprise, & many interrogatories, which I answered, & which seemed to satisfy the enquirers, I made a proper apology (I think) for your abrupt retreat, & delivered the messages of love; I then went homeward, facing my lonely habitation, but had satisfaction in the reflection of my past enjoyments; looking back with delight; & looking forward in a Hope of ^our^ being favoured to meet again. It can not but afford me inexpressible comfort to behold my dear Father pleased with my situation, & to find he had freedom to speak comfortably to us; I wish we may be so happy as to grow in Favour with the great Parent of all, & then we shall become more & more the joy of our Parents on Earth, but I am sensible if we dwindle in this respect, your affections shall also decrease for us, & we shall lose many sweet comforts; may it not be so!
I am wishing much to hear from you, as 6th day proved so inclement; I hope you made good use of the preceding fine day, how rejoiced was I that I coincided with you in the time of your departure, I thought it most prudent to allow your selves full time for the females to journey forward, & yet I was rather reproached by a friend, in a kind of query Did I not send you away: my Husband returned from Waterford 5th day evening, & is very busy since his return executing orders &c. I did not hear that Betty Gregory was engaged in Waterford in visiting families.
	I have the pleasure to acquaint thee that our dear friend Mary Dudley was delivered of a very fine, health looking Boy this morning, she had a safe good time, she says ^that this^ it & the first would bear no comparison, this was so much better; good encouragement for our much beloved sister Lydia, who I earnestly wish may be supported under her approaching trial, & that the bitterness of the cup may be mingled with Divine consolation, administering patience, & a stay to the mind, I also hope she will find the trial much less than before: my dear love attends her & my Brother: & Cousin Polly
We have been pretty ^well^ since thou left us, the children hearty as usual. Anne asking now where thou art, I hope thou hast begun a letter to me, giving account of your progress since we parted, & how thou found my Mother & sister Debby, the friends here are generally pretty well.
	My Husband joins me in dear love & duty to thee & Mother, please tell Mother I am much obliged to her for the flower roots, the Iris is set: our dear love salutes our sisters, Aunt & Cousins. Which is all occurs at present
	from thy dutiful & affectionate daughter
