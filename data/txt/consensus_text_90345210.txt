After tea we played games, and
some of the boys, amused the
company highly, by acting a very
funny charade. So the evening passed
pleasantly away and ere the clock
struck [underline]twelve[/underline] there was an empty
drawing room.
16. Jas White went by the ten O'clock
train to the North. Until nearly
one O'clock we were busy clearing
up things in the little-room,
then, Polly, Thos Henry, Liddy, and I
went out, and did not return
till dinner time. Papa went out
by the eleven O'clock train -
After tea Thos. Henry brought us
to hear Luue the ventriloquist, now
exhibiting himself at the Rotunda
and certainly he amused us
greatly -
