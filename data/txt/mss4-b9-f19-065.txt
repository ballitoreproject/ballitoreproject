11th mo 1823
My dear Elizth - Lucretia Wright kindly let me
know of her intention of going to Ballitore so I hope
to send this by her, I heard yesterday from Hannah Orpen
What had just recd a letter from her sister Mt. that
Deborah & the baby were going on well I hope
Eben & Betsy are with them ere this, I was much
obliged by thy thinking of me about the furniture
I would like much to have some of it if I
had a place to put it in at all events it
might lye by I would like the matress Eben
paid 3 guis for it & I do not think it the worse
for the wear any things I would get I would
give up again when E & D would return if
they'd wish for them the easy chair their own
bed &c the matress & G Norths little wash hand table
& Deb's throne & the cupboard that Eben put up in
the kitchen for jam, but I cannot buy any thing
till Edw gives me leave, however I would [deletion]not like[/deletion]
be obliged to thee to send me an account of the
prices of these things & then I will shew it to
Edw, I do not want to get Bargains -
I have just recd your letters containing the
account of dear Deb they are the same as I
recd from H. O yesterday after meeting, I sent
word to Dr Harvey & M Chambers - Why
art thou so anxious to hear what I sent to
Deborah? I did not receive thy letter till after

Betsy & Eben were gone & I had given Betsy
[insertion]almost[/insertion] all the baby clothes that D sent to me with
most of Mt..s besides - thou wilt excuse me
for sending away thy work, but there was notime
to make up any thing instead & I considerd
the little stranger had as good a right to
thy work as any other little one that might
come [deletion][/deletion] I have kept 3 robes
one of them M Goodwins one a plain one &
one elegantly tuck'd I have also the 4 larger
shifts & two small ones, now lest thou should
be afraid I would not do justice to the baby's
wardrobe I intend to replace them & get nurse
who is a very nice worker to make them
I intreat thou wilt not ask to do any of them
as I'm sure thy eyes are not fit to work
& to preserve them thou shouldst indulge them
as much as possible - Margaret is as gay
as ever we have put a little [underline]big coat[/underline] on
her & I have got nankeen to make her warm
frocks for the winter I wish thou could
see her - ah! I wish thou would come up
with M R so far on her way & thou [unclear]will [/unclear]
be with her while she'd stay in Dublin
even for a few days it would be very pleasant
we do not expect the family from Glendruid
sooner than about the middle or perhaps better

end of next month so thou need not be in
least afraid of being in the way - We have
not got any [deletion][/deletion] house as yet & have not decided
what we shall do, I dont feel at all uneasy
about it as we could get lodgings in a very
short time if necessary - I would be obliged
to my mother to send me two sheets
of the poor man's plaister - John
could not get the "Annals of the Parish" for
a longer time than 3 days together so that he
cannot well send it to Ballitore which
he regrets - I send the sealing wax
& a little book of RSL's I have this evening
recd a letter written in D's own hand very
short but telling of her own & the baby's welfare
she says it is a very little wee thing & does
not say whether they have got a name for
it
adieu with dear love to my mother
ever thy affect SB

Please to tell my mother that C Bentham
would not undertake to print her little
volume of anecdotes - R Webb likes them
exceedingly & thinks they might sell very
well I wish my mother would try if Jas:
Harvey would print it: I send it with
this
[unclear]Rea of Skinner[/unclear]
says that he
sent the [unclear]Medin[/unclear]
here [deletion][/deletion]
[deletion][/deletion]
I gave my mothers
memorandum
G S who lost it
would be glad
another as I can
then insist on
To tell John not to pay further
I have not any baby
clothes to bleach now
it was very well they
were not on the [underline]Green[/underline]
the medicines
