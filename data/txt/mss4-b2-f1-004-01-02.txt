My dear James,         

        I am concerned to find by thy last letter that thou hast been indisposed ++ That thou should be "every whit whole" in body & mind, I hope is lawful for thy friend to wish for thee at least - +++ I think it is of much advantage to young people to go abroad, and be a while among strangers, when their spiritual constitution is so ^well^  [pg number] 208 confirmed that their minds voluntarily refuse the evil & choose the good. By a diffuse & general acquaintance among Friends, their ideas become enlarged, their understanding more cultivated, & their manners more civilized & engaging. 
      Thou wants an explanation of some terms employed in my last. I know not whether it be in my power to satisfy thee in that respect - There are certain feelings of our own, exceedingly familiar to ourselves, the right conception of which it is very difficult to convey to others. By washing with the water, & drinking of the water of life, I meant the ministration of preparation for the reception of Good, & the full fruition of it: the one typified by John's dispensation of ablution, by his solitary life & kind of diet: the other witnessed by those who have happily received of his fulness, who said "If any man thirst let him come to me & drink." Both these dispensations are certainly good - but diverse in the degree & kind of comfort attending them. By the distinction also between water & wine I meant the difference between those rinsing, baptizing seasons, in which the soul is sensible of being cleansed & purified; though not of much divine consolation: and those spiritual joys & holy raptures with which the Saints, even in this life, are favoured, being as it were inebriated with the wine of the kingdom - By heavenly bread I likewise meant this glorious sensation which I have last mentioned; & that man is not to expect to live by this alone, but by every dispensation higher or lower, grateful or painful, which proceedeth from Divine direction. Walking according to this word in the heart, the law of the Spirit, though in a path of trials & tribulations, we shall be alive unto God: Ye shall therefore keep my statutes & my judgments: which if a man do, he shall live in them: I am the Lord."
