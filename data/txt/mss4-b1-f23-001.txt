On Sunday Night March 3rd 1754 I dreamed the following
Dream in the 20th. Year of my Age.
I thought myself in the Country being on a Journey on the Lord's Day,
in the former part of which Day I followed a youth whom I have often seen
at the Quakers Meeting, & who has lately joined them, tho' I knew not his
Name nor ever spoke to him to a Quakers Meeting, in which as well as I
can remember I had great satisfaction, but tho' I followed this youth I had
no Conversation with him; in the after part of the day I purposed going
the said Meeting again, but then being alone I took greater Notice of the
path leading to the house than I did before, & was surprised that I should
be either so intent on what I was about , or otherwise my Eyes so fixed in the
heels of my Guide as not to observe the Pains & Expence which had been bestowed
on the path which I then trod, the Earth on the right hand of which
I thought was supported by monstrous huge piles, which were fixed to
prevent the Earth's falling between my path was not above two Yards from
this precipice, out of which I turned to observe & admire the Contrivance &
labour there employed, but this I could not do without some fear which
always attends looking down a precipice; besides which at the bottom was a [unclear][/unclear]
broad & apparently a deep River; this River washed the foundation of
the eminence on which I stood; the whole Country on the other side of
the River being a perfect flat & very beautiful; this made-up up Way together
with the River I observed made up a direct Angle, at the very
Corner of which stood the meeting House, the Entrance into which
I found to my great Surprise was not in the Front, but the side
next the River, & that I must first descend a very steep & winding
flight of steps, which after the Descent regularly rose, & in
their winding led into the house: this Entrance appeared so very dangerous
& frightful, the steps so narrow & the River directly under that   
notwithstanding my very great inclination to go in. I dare not desce[unclear]nd[/unclear]
the steps; therefore I turned to the left hand as the Angle led, in which
Way not very far from this Meeting house stood some Mills. I conceiv'd
them Mash or Water mills, these so fear the Bank that the passage between
them & the River was very narrow, & being on a precipice, very
frightful, against which there was wooden handles fixed to some part of

of the Mills for the liminous to lay hold of which I stood in great need
of, being very fearful; here I found many of my acquaintance, tho' I remember
none of their Names variously employed or rather unemployed, idle
like myself: Here I continued some little Time, still wishing myself
at the Meeting my fear being a little off I viewed the River again between
the Mills & the Meeting, observed it very shallow & much lighter,  
some Gravel & Stones appeared the tide being now lower; this gave me
some Courage, concluding I shou'd not be drowned if I should step off
the Steps leading to the Meeting house; however I dare not nor did not
go but across the Country a different Way, went to a kind of Church,
[unclear] heard [/unclear] an established Minister, who the moment he had done pulled off
[unclear][/unclear] Surplice, & fell into a violent Passion &c. with the Clerk, which I
[unclear]re[/unclear]member offended me greatly, as I thought he hereby undid all which
[unclear]he[/unclear] had either said or done in the Pulpit, he was in a very great haste,
[unclear][/unclear] post chaise being in waiting for him, wanted something to draw the
Charge off his Blunderbuss, which I furnished him with, he went
off & I awoke. _ _ _

A Letter from
concerning the aforesaid Dream.
Thy Dream appears to me very significant, & worthy of Notice & I bespeaks
thus much at least; that way wherein in I thou hast been walking is a way made
by the will of Man, & held up & supported by natural Wisdom, & altho' thou
hast followed those who thou hast looked upon the most sincere to their
Worship, yet nevertheless thou hast been a Stranger to the true door by
which God's People enter into his house, or place of true Worship; & also
that God's love thro Jesus Christ is extended towards thee, by Virtue of
whose love & light, although manifested at present but by Dreams, thou
hast seen a Door in a low place, which heretofore thou had'st not seen,
& now came the Time of the Trial of Faith upon thee, as it did
upon the rich young Man, who enquired of holy Jesus what good thing
he shou'd do, that he might inherit eternal Life, & was told of the one
thing

thing needful; & had a Promise of heavenly Treasure on his parting
with the thing called for, & following this truly good Master, but alas!
he went away sorrowful; I beg thou may not do so, for the Case is almost
alike, he had great Possessions & was rich, & thou hast Gathered
together much Stuff & art grown rich in Notions of Religion, & have
walked pretty orderly amongst Men, & yet alike as the young Man's
Substance was called for, so is thine, & every true & perfect f[deletion]l[/deletion]ollower of
Jesus; not now outward & visible Substance, but all our head notions
& all we have gained by our willing & runnings & huntings before
the Lord must be offered up & parted with, for the Lord God has
determined to bring to nought Men's vain attempts of building to
heaven, altho' they may burn their Bricks ever so thoroughly. Oh!
must it be thus at last after all endeavours used, must the wise
become fools to obtain Christ, must the rich & full leave all riches &
become empty, & follow holy Jesus in Obedience by Faith? yea, it must
be so, may the Lord in Mercy increase thy faith, that thou may'st not
turn aside, but freely give up thy heart: the Way to the Kingdom is indeed
narrow & the gate or door strait, & few there be that find it, but
the Lord hath living Witnesses who can say in it there is peace, blessed be
the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is the Way, the Truth, the Life & the
Light of Men. If thou forsake the Truth & be offended at the Cross, &
so for Liberty & Ease turn to the left hand, & follow the Leading & Doctrine
of Men, I fear thou wilt be in danger of losing thy Light & Sense, & so
become a prey to thy Enemy & be made to grind in the Mill; it is Captivity
indeed to be overcome by the ways & vanities of this World to such who have
believed & seen a better; may thou be of those that being righteous & of clean
hands hold on their Way & grow stronger & stronger.
Fear god & be still, the Shepherd of Israel will gently lead those with young
& carry his lambs in his Arms: cease then from Man & from thy own Wisdom,
& wait on God in the Silence of all Flesh & nothingness of Self, that
thou mayest witness the Mountain of the Lord exalted above every
Mountain, & know the moving of that word by which all things are made
that are good & bless'd of God, & without it there is not any thing made that
is made. Amen.
I am in Truth
thy Friend
