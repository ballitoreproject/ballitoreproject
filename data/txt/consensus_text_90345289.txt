much alone. Avy's rabbit Puss had
6 young ones today.
16th,, Mama and Avy came out this
morning early having just seen Papa
Uncle Manliffe and Charlie off by the
nine O'clock packet. Papa's business in
Liverpool was to decide whether they were
to proceed directly to London or Scotland
which is I believe to be the [unclear]scene[/unclear] of their
which is I believe to be the [unclear][/unclear] of their
travels. I sincerely hope they may
be of use to them all - and that nothing
will occur to mar their enjoyment.
Papa or John had a short note from
Millie last week containing a very dull
account of his affairs poor fellow.
17th,, I rode to the post this morning,
and quite enjoyed the ride. There
was no letter from the travellers today.
18th,, Mama, Dick, Anna, and I drove over
to Monkstown this morning, Mama to
see her Aunts, and to pay a long
promised visit to Charlotte Strangman
and to buy some plants at the [unclear]nursery[/unclear]
