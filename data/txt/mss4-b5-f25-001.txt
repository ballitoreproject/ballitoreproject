Dear Cousin
Having an Oppr. to convey a few
Lines [insertion]to[/insertion] thee by a Boy who sets out from [unclear]Josn[/unclear]
[unclear]Fath[/unclear] a [unclear][/unclear] in ye Morning am not willing to send
it altho very late in ye Even & having
been somewhat hurried w[insertion]th[/insertion] ye Company of our
Frds & Relations makes me not quite so
much recollected as to answer thy last
letter as suitably as could wish; yet tho'
it would be satisfactory to hear some
acct. from me; my Wife is not quite so
well at present as sometime past, tho
better than might be expected considering
her delicate frame & it being our Quarterly
Meeting may be a means of her being fatigued
being some distance from [unclear]Meet's[/unclear] and have had
a good deal of Company. We have been
much favor'd with ye Company of several strangers
at our Quartlerly Meet wch was held at
this place; (ie yesterday & Today) [unclear]viz[/unclear] John
Pemberton Mahatabel Jenkins, Patience
Brayton & Rebecca Jones, who I look upon as
old Warriors in ye Cause - Rebecca
was very extraordinary in our [unclear]Mens[/unclear] Meet
where she attended during ye time her
Companion S Grubb was return'd. her
Certificate, recommending [unclear]her[/unclear] to be prepared
wth a plase of refuge, wch we shoud
stand in need of in a day wch she believes
wou'd come upon us sooner or later, as she
believed ye Scourge was stretched out overseen
reminding us of ye similar declaration our
P.S. my Bro [unclear]Holborn[/unclear] was here today, who [unclear]declaring[/unclear] his Love
they are afraid of loosing there Son who [unclear][/unclear] is very ill abt his Teeth [unclear]&[/unclear]
Do write when thou hast Oppy then I [unclear][/unclear] shall write thee again in a few weeks
I understand by Cous Letter of thy long journey & of ye loss of [unclear] [/unclear] Frd J. Haughton

late worthy deceased Frd Rab Walkes (who death
I expect ere this you have had some account of) had to
mention in some Meeting at Philadelphia whose
remarks wth those wch were made by other Frds
I wish may long be fix'd in our minds.
Last Eveng after Meeting we had to sup
with us Patience Brayton Mahall Jenkins
with us Patience Brayton Mahatl. Jenkins
her Companion Mary Davies, Debh Darby
Mary Birch: (Susn. Appleby, who lives at
Abiah Darbys a distant Relation of my Wife
& several other frds. Ester Marshall that was
& her Husband, Rich Routh Rob Barnard &
M: Davies had a little Bread to break among
us, or if I say a Cup of encouragement to
hand forth. I think her a very pleasing
Woman. M: Jenkins seems to like even
ye name of [underline]Ballitore[/underline] - dare say most of them
woud have wish'd to have been remember'd
to you, but I did not know till
Eveng of ye [unclear]Opps[/unclear] of conveying this to thee
& ye person sets out early in ye Morning
Patience & M: Jenkins had something to
administer wch was very acceptable
Wm Rathbone & some other strangers attend
our Meet. not residing in this County
Patience Brayton was a good deal at
Leeds a few weeks ago, & I was favord
wth a share of her Company, being my turn
to go wth them as Guide to our Monthly
meetg & stay'd near three days at ye place
meetg & stay'd near three days at ye place
it was held. I assure thee we have sustain

a very great loss in this Monthly Meetg by the
removal of our Frd Robt Walker - expect some
Frd will draw up something by way of testimony
respecting him, as in reading a particular
acct of his Death in our Meetg seemd to come
with so much weight upon ye Minds of Frds that
a proposal was made for something being
by way of testimony - he has left some
account of his travels &c, tho [insertion]in[/insertion] so incorrect
a state that it wou'd be difficult to make
out a regular Journal - My Sarah is a
fine Girl I assure thee, as she talks much
& is very entertaing. likewise my second
Daughter is a lovely Child ie Hannah, tho
has only run ab't ten or twelve Weeks, being
now Eighteen Months old - My Wife recoved
very well, wch we attribute partly frm her
not attempting to Nurse her little one wch
is a fine Boy named Edward, who is out at
Nurse & thrives well, being Eleven weeks old
we have got to a much more airy House than
our last - Don't know when I shall get to
Ballitore, but hope I shall some time shd have
been glad to have red a few lines from the
by Jno Dearman, ye young Man who brought
Cousn Saml Webster a lettr. frm thee; he favd
me wth a perusal wch made some recompense
observe thy agreeable remark respecting ye
American Frds however most that I have seen
& agree wth thee in Sentiment; - Perhaps thou
wou'd hear ye imprudent Step Cous'n [unclear][/unclear] has took

wish Saml. not follow her steps as he gets very gay in
his appearance & seems to associate wth unsuitable companions.
I wish when thou writes him thou woud caution
him frm splitting on ye same rock - My Wife Sisters
are one wth a Relation in Lincolnshire, ye other apprentice
to a young Woman a Mantua Maker [unclear]London[/unclear]
who will be loose in ye Spring only being bound [unclear]up[/unclear]
one yea - Accept our Dear Love to self & all Relations

of them to be more acquainted wth thy affectionate
Kinsman
