From the same to the same

My dear friend,
	++++ Sally Neale writes us agreeable accounts from her husband. Though he writes modestly concerning his own services, yet from the extracts from his letters I think I perceive he has been eminently favoured. When a good gift is accompanied with prudent conduct in the receiver, the instrument is likely to be of lasting service. But be the gift ever so excellent, if that wisdom which dwells with prudence does not attend, though the gift may be continued for a while in degree for the edification of others, yet its effectual use is much curtailed, & there is great danger of the instrument being entirely laid aside. I have heard it said
	When words & deeds, doctrines & life agree,
	We then preach well: & not till then preach we.
Dost thou remember how Samuel Fothergill in the last meeting of Ministers, called out for, Practice, Practice, Practice. +++
	We were much concerned here about Samuel Fothergills indisposition desire [sic] much, if it be consistent with Infinite Wisdom, whose ways are not as our ways, nor his thoughts as our thoughts, that he may ^be^ continued a while longer to the Church Militant, which (to speak ^reason^ humanly) can badly spare him. But what shall we say? To the Lord omnipotent we are to look for help & succour in every distress. He alone never changeth, nor faileth, but abideth [page number] 158 the sure help, strength & wisdom of those that singly trust in Him, & wait patiently & diligently for his appearance through the medium of his Spirit throughout all generations of men +++
	My wife ^&c^ joins me in affectionate & cordial salutation to thee, thy spouse, & our dear friends there, who am,
	Dear Joseph
