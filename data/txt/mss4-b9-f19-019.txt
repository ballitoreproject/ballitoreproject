My dear Elizabeth _ We have been so long
without hearing from you in Clogheen
that we begin to grow rather uneasy tho' ' we
[unclear] cant see any [deletion] reason [/deletion] cause for uneasyness
If we could always look to the best side of
things & put the best construction on every
thing we would never be troubled with
artificial misfortunes which are often more
hardly to be borne than real ones.
Poor Margaret is a patient suffered under
Les. I did not hear how she was this morning
but yesterday was easier to her than many
days before she is so affected with pains in
her bones particularly her hips that
she is with the greatest dificulty she can
stand She gets up with Mary's help to have
the bed made & with the help of two
she cacifes along the length of the room
then discharges a great quantity of matter
which makes it necessary to change her
night shift once & sometimes twice every
day, this operation is both painful &
troubling to her. Harriet Lefonn is
hired still & spends much of her time
with Margaret. She is at present with T W d s
Ballitore 24 th of 9 th mo 1815
