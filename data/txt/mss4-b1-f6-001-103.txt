Clonmell 23rd July 91.
My Dear Madam
We got safe here, and are both of us in good health
the civility, & attention of Mr. & Mrs. Grubb have been
unremitted since our arrival - Mrs. E. dines with them
this day - we have not yet got into our barracks
but shall I hope very shortly, our lodgings are very
indifferent tho clean 13/- english per week [unclear]but the[/unclear]
furniture [underline]horrid[/underline], & other necessary utensils equally
bad: the loss of the portmanteau still frets me
particularly as it has cost me near a Guinea advertizing,
hand bills &c. and as yet without
effect - it's not been returned strongly marks the
infamy & rouguery of the lower class of people
in this country, had the accident happened in
dear old England, it wou'd have been an accident
[underline]only[/underline] not attended with [underline]loss[/underline] - I beg of Mr. Leadbeater
of some intelligent friend to wait on the Man
from whose house we were drove (I think his name
is [underline]Payne[/underline], which alone woud make me inimical to him)
and find out what he has done, and also to know
what recompence he will make me for the loss which
I have
