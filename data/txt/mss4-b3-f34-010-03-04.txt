My dear friend,


        Expecting a convenient opportunity for sending thee a line, though I do not find, upon search, that I am in thy epistolary debt, I sit down in order to greet thee with the best love which I am at ^in^ present possession of. Even love of the very best kind, like the ocean, ebbs & flows  & the expression of it, if legitimate, will do likewise. Thou knows^est^ I love thee, & want thee to increase in all manner of Good  & when I am present with thee, & feel this desire predominant, & find an openness for communication, I take, have long taken a pleasure in conversing with thee. And if it should please him, who openeth & shutteth in Infinite Wisdom, to bind those sweet influences, let us ever be content, & resignedly have the key of the precious stone-house, the hidden treasures, in the hand of him that is holy & true. To lose our own wills in the will of our great Creator appears to me the highest excellence of human nature. May we press after the attainment of it, that so we may witness preservation from evil of all kinds, ourselves, & be enlarged in a capacity to promote the most glorious cause that ever existed, or will exist upon earth!
        Thou knows [sic] I am thoughtful about children  I love thy  I hope she is endowed with good qualities & dispositions  I liked much to see that she [page number] 142 refused to do behind thy back what she was not allowed by thee to do before thy face  this is liberal & honest. And I trust that as she has happily adopted her mothers will in general for the rule of her conduct, she is coming & come to know the will of her Father which is in Heaven, & that she will hear & obey his voice, finding it to ^tally^ correspond & agree with the precepts of & instructions of her religious mother, whose hands it should be her conscientious care, through life, to strengthen, & not weaken, by all her deportment. ++++


        thy truly affectionate friend
