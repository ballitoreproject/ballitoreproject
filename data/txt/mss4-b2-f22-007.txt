Clonmel 2 month 7th 1787
My Dear Grandfather,
	As it is a long time since I wrote to thee, I shall mention a little of what I can recollect for thy Entertainment. Our French-master, I suppose, is gone to Waterford, and another is come in his stead, but I have not begun with the new French-master yet. Last first-day there were two Presentations of Marriage laid before our Meeting; one by George Peet & Elizabeth Allen, & the other by Nicholas Chaytor and Sarah Widdows. I am going on pretty well with my Latin & Arithmetick. My little sister Elizas eyes are bravely. My Sister Anne has gotten a Pain in her side.

Please give all our dear love to all ou[r] [R]elations & friends in Ballitore, and believe me to be, My dear Grandfather, thy dutiful Grandson Abraham Grubb.
