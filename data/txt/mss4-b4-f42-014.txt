My dear Mother,
I believe thou thinks we are very long without
writing at either side: I am sure I think so, & lament
it. for I really have not an opportunity of hearing respecting
my friends in Leinster, & you may often desire
to hear more about friends here, by accident almost I
heard of the removal of our ancient honourable friend
James Christy, I had a great love & respect for him, &
therefore felt for our loss, he lived to a fine old age, & was
I believe an example of uprightness in his day, I think
his family will greatly miss his company & innocent spirit,
our friend William Crotch gave me some information
respecting his close, that valuable friend, & his companion
came to this town last evening, & is to have meeting here
I believe tomorrow, he gave me some account of your
welfare at Ballitore, & that thou wert at Carlow
which I was glad to hear of, I have not heard who
nurses Molly's last child, or what name it bore, so I
am very ignorance of what my relations are doing, I
am quite fond of a New's-letter, because while we are
in this World of mixture, we want to know how it
fares with our kindred & near friends, & yet I am unaccountably
lazy about writing, & some times am destitute
of pens, but Thomas Welsh I expect will take care

care of me now in this respect, & I hope to be more attentive
to [deletion]I[/deletion] maintaining this desirable correspondence with you, this
Lad has been very ill, was laid up with his Aunt in Carvack,
I believe with a fever, went to Mallow since, &
seems now finely recovered, he continues to be agreeable,
& I believe desirous of doing every thing right. We were
at Youghal at same time, I believe my Husband received
benefit by bathing there, we had lodgings from a friend
furnished, paid a guinea a week for them, we were 10
in family there, my Husband, self, Anne, Richard, Jane
Chandlee, Margt, Robert & Thomas, & two servants, had
two horses & car to take us to the Sea-side, we all
liked the dip, & I think all received benefit. I think it
has strengthened my bowels, & I continue to go into the
fresh water since I came home, as do the children,
Jane Chandlee is very much pleased with the water,
& looks very well, she is [insertion] a[/insertion]sweet creature, very steady
sensible, exceedingly obliging & condescending, we shall
miss her much I believe when she leaves us, yet the
dear child seems to have so st[insertion]r[/insertion]ong an attachment to home
that at times my children tell me she is uneasy to be
gone, longing I suppose to see them, having an affectionate
at mind, but I don't expect she can go till the Dublin
meeting, which is approaching fast. I intend to send
these few lines by Moat, as its likely some of your

families will be there [unclear]ly[/unclear] meeting, I may tell thee
we continue in our old Mansion, Richard Sparrow
having changed his intention of moving, requested us not to require
his house for some time, he is building a spacious habitation
in the country, so that I fancy we shall not leave
this before this time twelve-month. I am quite easy about
it, having a comfortable dwelling where I am, the object for
inducing to change is the great convenience of residing close
to our business, & the manifold inconvenience of being separated
from it: my Husband is going on improving his
Mill &c. at Cloheen, he is at present there, Richard goes
with him, as he has resolved not to ride alone since this
accident, & a great mercy it was that his life was spared,
accident, & a great mercy it was that his life was spared
as several to our knowledge have lost their lives by falls
from Horses in this case the beast fell under him, quite
suddenly, & pitching him on his shoulder, caused the
dislocation, his arm continues feeble, & he still wears
a loose Coat. I hope soon to hear from you, &
with desiring a good account of thy state of health, &
mine & the children's love to you all draw to a conclusion,
but I may inform thee Anne had a letter from
Betsy Dudley, conveying a favourable account of her
Mother's health, I remain thy affectionate daughter
