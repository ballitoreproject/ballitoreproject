1829?
My dear Eliza
I am going to trouble
thee with a commission which if
thou cannot conveniently execute
I will not be offended, viz. to get
me as much nett as will make
two caps and what quilling will
do for borders (I want them for Sarah)
I would like the borders to be pretty
full, which would ribbon or silk
twist look the best in it, or would
plain bobbin do, it would have the
advantage of washing. I also would [insertion]thou[/insertion]
[insertion]would get me)[/insertion] as much [insertion]cambrick[/insertion] muslin as will make
me two wrappers, I think I want
them, and that this is a good
time to get them, please to consider

that it is only if it is convenient
to thee that I expect thee to
get them, I do not want thee to
tire thyself. I was glad to hear
thou had so much prudence to
day as thou mentions in thy note
for which I commend thee,
though did not give us a much better
account of poor Sally, I [deletion]was[/deletion] did
not expect to see her look so badly
as she did on fourth day when I
saw her eyes looked very heavy
I thought, and not at all bright
as they often do when the lungs are
affected, perhaps Dr Mills' opinion
is right my Mother seemed to have
more hope of her, if that was the case
but I suppose it is very uncertain,
I pity my poor Uncle, he is very
dull and that is not to be wondered
at. I mind the caps are entirely
from myself as Sarah did not ask
me to make them I think the borders
would look better quilled as she
likes them pretty full and not
hemmed. Thou wilt think me
very particular and
troublesome to be
bothering thee at
such a time with
my things. I had a letter from
Lidy to night she desires her love to
thee and says she hopes thou wilt
soon write to her. I was so long without
hearing from them that I almost
stopped expecting a letter at all, it was
very pleasant to get it, now although
I have this written I feel almost inclined
not to send it; Lucy is laughing at my filling
the sheet and says I must be very much
[underline]enlarged[/underline]; it is just after striking eleven, my
Mother is asleep on the sofa, Manliff is gone
to bed and Lucy is writing on a nice piece
of pink note paper I need not tell thee to
whom, with dear love I am thy affectionate
sister Selina
5th day night

My Mother says she a pretty little bit of figured
muslin would like the best to cover the pincushion
for S Jacob thou might get that
also, and a little bit of muslin to trim it.
