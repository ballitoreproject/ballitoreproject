Clonmel 1st mth 10th 1788
My dear aunt Shackleton
care for me express'd in a letter recd. from thee a few days
since were not [insertion]only [/insertion]acceptable but consider'd a real favour of
which I wish to approve myself worthy, believing that thou
art one who like the apostle hast no greater joy than
to see thy children & [insertion]all [/insertion]children in the church walking in the
truth- The matter thou alludes to has indeed been long
a secret in my mind & I have often [deletion]bexxxx [/deletion][insertion]entertain'd [/insertion]hopes that
a necessity wou'd not have been laid upon me [insertion]ever [/insertion]to divulge
it; but so it is, that He who has a right to dispose of us,
sometimes condescends hiddenly & gradually to work in us
that [deletion]a [/deletion]great work of resignation to Himself whereby we
are measurably filled to receive such [insertion]impressions [/insertion]as are best consistent
with the great purposes of [insertion]His [/insertion]unerring wisdom & have feelingly
to acknowledge that His ways are unsearchable
& past our finding out, till revealed to us in the fullness
of time with that proportion of light & strength which
(as we keep in the faith & patience) are found to be
sufficient for the present day -- To the accounted with
that excellent armour thou speaks of, is truly desirable
& when without [insertion]it [/insertion]the prayer of my heart is, quietly to keep
in my tent & even with it to make no boast, neither
to use it but by renew'd commissions -- it is one of [insertion]the [/insertion]essentials
for the poor christian traveller in every station
in life, because of the [insertion]open [/insertion]attacks, the side blows & sly pursuits
of our [underline]unwearied [/underline]adversary -- I feel them daily
Thy very kind salutation & motherly

& long for an encrease of strength to resist him stedfast
in faith -- he many times seeks to make our hearts sad
when the Lord has not made them sad & to perplex &
embitter our passage through life when he perceives
that [underline]that[/underline] is the length of his chain--- we propose setting
of for Cork in the morning - even that grasshopper (when
compared with other prospects) is a burden & I cou'd
soon work myself up to believe that I am not able to go halfway
[insertion]soon[/insertion] work myself [insertion]up[/insertion] to beleive that I am not able to go halfway
to Clohene - how admirably wise & adapted to the weakness
[insertion]of our frame[/insertion] was that exportation of the great master's "take no thought
for tomorrow" this & such like compassionate [insertion]counsel[/insertion] sometimes
drop into my mind in the midst of my conflicts & prove
to be words of that kind which both winds & waves obey.
To be encompassed with a due sense of our own weakness
& manifold infirmities is however beyond all doubt a profitable
state to be in & wisely dispensed to us, because then
having nothing to plume ourselves with, but like Joshua
clad in our own estimation in filthy garments & having
Satan at our right hand ready to resist us when endeavouring
secretly to approach the smallest revelation of omnipotent
help we sometimes find to our humble admiration
that we are not utterly forsaken; & I do believe my dear
aunt (& it seems to arise in my mind more for thy encouragement
[insertion]friend[/insertion] aunt (& it seems to arise in my mind more for thy encouragement
than my own if such a child as I may minister
a little spiritual refreshment to a mother in Israel
as I believe thee to be) that we are often nearest to
divine favour & infinite kindness when we think ourselves
farthest from it & may at such seasons according & our

faith draw near to the throne of grace with boldness
to obtain grace to help us in the time of need --
I have just recd. another favour from Ballitore viz a
letter from Uncle Shackleton, which increase my obligation
to your family; indeed you are so like ours at York, so
numerous, so valuable & lovely that it seems almost out
of my power to treat every root & branch with that respect
& gratitude which they are each deserving of: Uncle's
Letters are [insertion]a[/insertion] treasure to me, so are thine, & were my possessions
equal I should rejoice to give value for value; but I'm sure
without a sympathy more than natural no one knows or
comprehends the destitute stripped situation my mind
often is in (just as if a cloud was over the present life
& no faith respecting a better existing in me) & I really
fear that [unclear][/unclear]I put the advice in practice "to wash & ano[unclear][/unclear]
rather in the extreme -
brother & she purpose to set off about the time we
do tomorrow for Cork - they go in the Cab - few peoples
company delights & instructs me so much as sister Peggys,
we endeavour sometimes to spend an hour or two together,
when the mercurial properties in her composition
generally expels some of my disorders (at least
for a time) & when they return having the medicine so
near me I am not backward in applying to it -- Dear
Mary Dudley is I think [unclear]too[/unclear] much for her, though
she is expected to set off with sister Sally John tomorrow
for Cork - My husband says he has a great
sister margaret & hers are finely

deal of bottom love & esteem for you & bids me tell thee
so - Ann says I may tell thee she is going backwards
& is afraid that she'l become like such as Uncle laments
over in his letter - Poor Ann, she has gone through
a great deal of late whether for future usefulness in
the church militant or in order to prepare for that state
of undefiled [insertion]rest[/insertion] where there is no more change has frequently
been matter of doubt -- She also desires
love to every branch of your family & I am dear
Aunt thy truly affectionate & often tried S R Grubb
