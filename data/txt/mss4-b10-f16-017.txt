 1823?
Britain St. - 2 Sept.
Dear Eliza,
Having time and inclination I begin
a letter to you, to congratulate you on your safe arrival
at S Eves, and to wish you joy at being able to write such an
agreable account, as you have written to Eliza, which she was
so good as to shew me and which I read with a great deal
of pleasure as it came rather unexpectedly I heartily hope
your prospect of happiness may not diminish when you
become better acquainted with your pupils. You say you
are in a pleasant country and have tolerable hills to climb
up and admire all those or rather several of those bea[insertion]u[/insertion]ties
of nature, which soothe the mind with those delightful
feelings, which seem to be confined to a few happy mortals
and which are indescribable almost by words, I know very
few who seem to feel as much as I do myself on such occasions,
I say "seem" for perhaps they feel more than I am aware
of, when you are not pretty well acquainted with a persons
thoughts on other subjects you may very well readily be deceived
in this particular, especially if they are of a reserved disposition.
I am quite out of sorts on account of being so little
in the country this year. I am afraid I am growing
very uneven tempered a little frets me and I seem as
if I was losing ground in the esteem of some of my friends

7th I was interrupted when I had arrived at the bottom [insertion]of[/insertion] the
preceding page and after having read it over this day, I think
I was rather gloomy in my surmises; we are very apt when we
are displeased with our conduct, to imagine others also
are displeased with our own conduct, to imagine others also
displeased, and by being vexed accordingly we regret afterwards,
circumstances, which have happened at the time of [deletion]y[/deletion]our
mind being in that state and which a little sincere[deletion]ty and[/deletion]
explanation would have effectually cleared up. I find it so
with myself and I think I have perceived [insertion]it[/insertion] in your difference
with Edward. There is something unpleasant to a mutual
[underline]friend[/underline] to see a difference of this sort, what is the inference? we
must naturally suppose that one of the parties has perceived
something in the actions or opinions of the other which makes him
think worse of this mutual friend, where are we to [unclear]stop[/unclear]? the
difference must proceed farther and cause differences among
bodies of friends which are the original cause of all parties and
sects, I sometimes think that friendship as it is frequently
understood is a very cant term, as more [unclear]word[/unclear] without any
substance. If the[deletion]y[/deletion] world went as we would wish it there
would be no such thing as individual friendship. Right
friendship as I would explain it must last through
all the ups and downs of this life, and not fly off as it suits
its convenience at [insertion]the[/insertion] first exhibition of what it may call a fault

friendship cannot exist with out perfect sincerity of thought
and action and between minds open as we may conceive
individuals to be who have not been educated by the [unclear]const[/unclear]
which prevails in the world in fact perfect friendship is a
thing impossible between mortals we should therefore
cultivate that general amenity of manners which helps to
keep up mutual acquaintance without expecting too much
from our friends and being displeased with them at the
first appearance of strangeness, for it is often only appearance
The difference between you and Edward originated only
in appearances. Edward ever since he was married seems
to be wholly occupied with his business, I believe he scarcely
thinks of any thing else, and the manner he has acquired by
constantly thinking on the one subject appears to others to be
derived from a different cause and gives him to much the appearance
of a reserved and gloomy character. He appeared
to you as cold and uncivil and you acted as you thought
from your actions he has made more surmises and so it has
ended in a breach between you without sufficient cause neither
of you asked the other the cause of this difference and so it has ended.
Excuse this letter being taken up with the one subject. I am alone
by myself at Brit. St this Sunday watching the house. Eliza has
written a letter which now lies on the chimney piece and which

I suppose will tell you all the news. Edward and Sarah and my
mother are gone to England and I suppose are this day enjoying
the Lakes in Cumberland they went on Tuesday and I suppose will
stay about a fortnight. They were speaking of coming home by Glascow
and [insertion]seeing[/insertion] Loch Lomond Lock Katrine and other scenes, it is not very unlikely
but they will see Swan's factory at Lanark.
Glendruid is as usual and has been the scene of a great display
of company on Sundays more this year than ever I remember it
we were only one Sunday alone this year and W Knightley's wondering
toward one greatly expanded at the quantity of relations we
have he is an anxious man I am greatly disappointed
in him he has not an atom of politeness at least as far as I see
of him, I believe he has a good deal of information and he is [insertion]almost[/insertion] always
reading and yet his learning does not make him the more agreeable.
Little Margaret is at present at Glendruid and looks very well it is a
pity to have her in town the country makes such an alteration for the better.

Will you write to me as quickly as it is convenient you must be
pretty well occupied I hope the elder Miss Eves are conversible and
that they tend to make your time pass more agreably by enlivening it with
conversation. I am in town all this day by myself did not see a
creature I knew except RD Webb. They are making alterations at the
back of the house which leaves it so much exposed that I was obliged to
stay at home to watch it. I however rode out for about an hour and a half
in the Park it was a delightful day I came home and did not like
dining by myself so I went out to a tavern for variety I took tea at home
and Richard is just after coming in from Glendruid where they are all
well, that is, our family, Charlotte Malone is not improving I am afraid
of her. They were alone at the big house except that James Stephens was with
them and Magt. is well. All friends here are well as far as I know
I intend sending this to Ballitore as the Best method of having it
sent to you I hope Elizabeth will send it for me, I also send your
manuscript and thank you farewell yours John.
