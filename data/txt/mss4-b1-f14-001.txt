I Had a Sight of the following lines soon after they were writ &
lightly looked over them. I suppose I took less notice than Jacob did
of his Son Joseph's Dream, but lately looking over them again, they
made considerable Impression[deletion]s[/deletion] on my mind, [deletion]&[/deletion] especially that part
Relating to the great Dog, which I have had cause to remember [deletion]of[/deletion]
And have had freedom to Cop[deletion]p[/deletion]y them out & communicate them to
some thinking people; which take as follows, Vizt.
On the 24th day of the 2d month 1755 being at our Quarterly
meeting at Burlington I lodged at a Friends house (J.R) &
as I slept, I dreamt I was at home in my Father's House, with
Divers Relations & Acquaintances: I walked out, as my Usual
Custom of an Evening left my Eyes to ye firmament, the moon
& Stars shone very bright, but that which most drew my Eye
was in the midst of the rest, different both in Size & Splendour
so Remarkably different I cou'd but view it & saw it grow very large &
bright, that It outshone all the other Stars, & the neighbouring ones
appear'd dim wth it's brightness: it seem'd to Glory in it's Excellence
wch was great for some time: nearest to this I saw two as much
inferior to the other Stars, as the [deletion]other[/deletion] [insertion]great one[/insertion] was above them: on the
East Side of it: one South of the other. I look'd on the great Star &
saw it swell & burst into two equally large on a Star colour'd
axle; one towards the East & the other towards the West: they
seperat[insertion]e[/insertion]d as far as they cou'd unless they had fallen quite off
their Axle: while they continu'd Separate the two small ones
began to Stir & were in perpetual motion 'till they were loos'd.
Immediately the [insertion]other[/insertion] two unit[insertion]e[/insertion]d into one again, not so bright as ye
first, but [deletion]off[/deletion] [insertion]of[/insertion] a more troubled aspect. I saw the two Small ones as soon
as they were loos'd fly wth great force again[insertion]s[/insertion]t the bright one, but
seemed not to disturb it: they spread themselves around as if to
hide the light of it: then woud strive to root it out: & as their Envy
Encreas'd all their Starry glory decreased, save that they had a dim
resemblance, as the shadow of a light by wch I had a clear discovery of
their form: they were fashion'd like a wheel, quite bare to the nave
& upon spo[deletion]a[/deletion]k[insertion]e[/insertion]s, in wch form they grew so large, they overspread the great Star
that I cou'd scarcely see any part of it. When they had quite cover'd it
they were silent. I was grieved that those shadows should be suffer'd
to hide the bright Star, & call'd to people in ye House to come & see
those strange sight[deletion]s[/deletion]: none came. I beheld 'till the bright Star

Star was loosnâ€™d & fled towards another part of the firmament,
the other[deletion]s[/deletion][insertion]two[/insertion] pursue'd [insertion]it[/insertion] wth unweary'd Swiftness. I follow'd [insertion]them with my Eye[/insertion] till they were
out of Sight, then look'd [deletion]I[/deletion] [insertion]up[/insertion] to ye place [deletion]where[/deletion] they descended from, Expecting
to see it Empty, but there was another Star in it as large
in Circum. as ye former, but of a very pale colour. While I was musing
on what I had seen, my father came to me. I related to him & wth. all
I [insertion]told him[/insertion] shou'd have t[deletion][/deletion][insertion]ho[/insertion]ught them such vapours as we frequently see if
I had not seen them firmly fixt as any of the Stars: he asked me
wch way they went: I told him to the north East: he said if the Stars
left their places, we might depend upon it's not ending here. Whilst we
were talking I lift up my Eyes & beheld a Star settle in ye Firmament
not bright but of a Clouded red: it grew very fast from ye size of a Star to
the moon when she [deletion]had[/deletion] [insertion]is[/insertion] about two thirds Eclipsed: but I saw the
Circle as of the moon all round it's place in ye West: it seem'd [insertion]to be[/insertion] about 2 or 3
hours high: that part wch. was not filled was uppermost. I looked
upon it till I [deletion]see[/deletion] [insertion]saw[/insertion] the red Substance in the South part begin to waste
like a declining Eclipse, & continu[insertion]e[/insertion]d w[deletion]e[/deletion][insertion]ai[/insertion]sting till there appeared in
the South & North of the Circle two Dark Clouds both rise at once,
of an equal height & figure, & seem'd to proclaim war against each
other, but that In the South soon yield[insertion]e[/insertion]d in Subjection to that
In the North of the Circle & fell into an imperfect form, having
some like[deletion]li[/deletion]ness of a beast, wth his head towards the others: that
in the North of the Circle had a face like flesh, the other part
of his head was a Cloud: the uppermost part of his Body resembled
a Human Creature: the rest a dark Cloud: he held a s[insertion]c[/insertion]ythe
in one hand, but I cou'd not discern what was in ye other: he
grew in Darkness 'till that Side of the Circle was fill'd: his head
reached to the uppermost part of the it: his Eyes seem'd full of Anger
& seemed to look upon the moon & Stars wth Defiance, & Shook his
weapon towards the Earth, as it were to threaten the Inhabitants
wth woe: but no part of them moved out of the Circle at all: my
understanding & memory was as [insertion]when[/insertion] awake, & wondering with great Sorrow
what those signs might mean it occur'd to my mind the
predictions of the Lord to his disciples, that there shou'd be signs
in the [deletion]moon[/deletion] [insertion]Sun[/insertion] & it shou'd be darken'd, & the moon shou'd not give her
light, the Stars shou'd fall from heaven, & the powers thereof
be shaken: which made me think such a tribulation as he
spake of was near. I prayed to be prepar'd for it's approach &
cry'd aloud what will become of us, meaning mankind in general.
father ask'd wat ye matter was: don't [deletion]you[/deletion] [insertion]thou[/insertion] see said I those 2 fighting in
the Sun as Black as ye night: he looked very thoughtful[deletion]l[/deletion], but

but gave me little answer. I mourn'd with a view of a great Destruction,
having none to Comfort me, I cou'd look no longer, but [insertion]in[/insertion][deletion]wth[/deletion] grief
& surprize fell wth my face on the ground [deletion]but[/deletion]: how long I lay I am
Insensible; but when I arose found my myself alone, & went into ye
house. [deletion]&[/deletion][insertion]But[/insertion] as soon as I entered [insertion]the door[/insertion] a great Dog jumpt at me, aiming at my
Throat. I called to ye people present to rescue me, myself not being
able to resist him, but none wou'd hear me: he threw me down
& [insertion]pressed[/insertion] [deletion]squeezed[/deletion] my Throat so hard, I was almost strangled, & despairing
of Life I strove, tho' wth much difficulty, to center my mind [deletion]for[/deletion] [insertion]to[/insertion] a
future State. I thought myself [insertion]quite[/insertion] at the point of Death, but on a sudden
the Dog grew weary, for he had not [insertion]opened his mouth from the first, nor torn[/insertion], [deletion]touched[/deletion] me with his paws [deletion][/deletion]
[deletion][/deletion] altho I was deliver'd from ye Dog, wth out
a wound, yet my fellow Creatures behaved strange to me, nor
car'd at all for me, being busy wth their own affairs. While I had been
out the forepart of ye House where I was to go in was Divided into
an apartment by itself that I cou'd not get in to the room from
whence I came [insertion]out,[/insertion] nor dare think I had a right in ye world in my
great Distress I awoke & as it made Deep impression of Sorrow on
my mind asleep, it remained to be so when I awoke, & I cou'd not
be easy without writing it, while fresh in my memory: wch I did
the 2d day following, the fourth of ye week: & wch so ever it may mean
I Hope I [deletion]will[/deletion] [insertion]shall[/insertion] be made sensible to make right application of it to myself
for Instruction & precaution, knowing that every person as well
as family must [deletion][/deletion] [insertion]mourn[/insertion] apart for themselves & as Revelations
& Interpretations belong to the Almighty, & ye di[insertion]s[/insertion]posing [/unclear]
of all things are in his power, I shall leave it for time
to shew the Event. M.F-
