Richard Shackleton to Abiah Darby

Ballitore, 22nd of 8th month 1784

Abiah Darby,

Dear Friend,

I look upon it as a duty incumbent on those who have left an hospitable house & gone a long journey, to let the Master or Mistress know what is become of them. Sukey I believe would tell you of our getting well to Shrewsbury. We lodged there at Friend Youngs, & his daughters would make us break our fast with them, & would see us in the coach next morning. Twas too much - but being females they over-ruled. We set off from thence I believe between three and four oclock, but through a delay in waiting for another coach on the road, did not reach Conway till about one oclock the succeeding morning. It would have been dismal travelling in the night, a rough & hilly road, had not Something (I humbly hope) of Good, tendered the spirit & prepared an offering. Indeed I know nothing which so composes, exhilirates [sic], comforts & strengthens the mind as a little of that which is divine. We were indulged with a reasonable share of bed at Conway, & with time to view some of the antiquities of the place before we left it - we ascended old Penmenmaur with pretty good spirits, & M: Was highly delighted entertained with the stupendous objects which presented themselves on each side. We reached Holyhead in good time in the evening & the next evening (12th instant) we embarked in the packet boat, with a pretty brisk gale of wind. We arrived in Dublin the evening of 13th & next day reached my home, safe & well, finding all well here, & I have abundant cause of thankfulness to the Author of all our mercies, for his gracious preservation & protection extended in many instances to me & mine. ++++
       Notwithstanding the rumours of commotion in this land, we seem to enjoy present tranquility, through the favour of a merciful Providence. I wish we may all rightly improve this present tranquility; for though no publick disturbance should be permitted in our time (which is uncertain) yet a day of close trial we know awaits each of us individually, a day in which ^if^ the best will have nothing to spare, astonishment will surely overtake the careless, the lukewarm & the unprepared. +++
With a grateful sense of acknowledgement of all your kindness & civilities, & with much esteem & respect, I remain

thy affectionate friend

Richard Shackleton
