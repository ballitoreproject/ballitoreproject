Forsythe
Biddy - How in the name of wonder
do [insertion]you[/insertion] keep such good clothes on yourself & the children
& it is not Sunday you are [deletion][/deletion] [insertion]drest[/insertion] but every day
Winny - We dont pretend to much dress, but
we strive to be clean indeed, & always to have
a little change a piece -
Biddy - If all of us had [insertion]one[/insertion] [deletion]a[/deletion] suite a piece, I'd be
very proud; but indeed now the linen & every thing
is so dear I could not keep a tack upon the children
but for Mrs - & what the quality give us
lasts no time -
Winny - For service they dont, but for a change
for the small children they are very useful -
However if you take my advice you'll allways
keep a bit of wool & flax spinning in the house
& according as it is ready give it to the weaver
& you wont miss the price of it as you do when
you go to the shops, there's few poor men can
stretch upon a white shirt now -

[underline]It's not so sign for &c[/underline]
Biddy - Why then its like Thomas can
stretch upon it & all your children too.
Winny - We made all that linnen as I told
you, & threded it ourselves, it is not a good colour
by the bought linnen, but it is not a bad colour
neither - & we have a piece in the loom now &
will have some yarn ready shortly
Biddy - I tell you Winny - we could not afford to
buy the flax - it is hard enough to keep a bit
in [deletion]her[/deletion] [insertion]our[/insertion] mouths.
Winny - The times are very hard, & only for our
bit of land we could not have the flax.
Biddy - Some people have more luck than others,
Winny - We would not have such luck only we
waited till we could gather enough of our earnings
to build this house upon this bit of land we took;
& to be sure many a one thought we'd never
marry if we waited for that, but Thomas was
mighty industrious entirely & never drank nor
smoked nor wore out his clothes boxing or the like
so you'd wonder how soon he gathered something
worth

worth talking of.
Biddy - And did you gather nothing yourself?
Winny - I was at service, so you know I could
not have much money to save - but as I had
a liking for Thomas all along, I still thought of
making little provision for housekeeping & bought
wool & had it spun & wove for blankets; more
times I bought flax & got linnen made; or
whenever I had a bit of time I was patching a
quilt— I was saving a little clothes too, so that
when we married I had plenty of [deletion]everything[/deletion]
linnen & woolen, & you may be sure it never
went astray with us either old or new—Thomas
got but middling health for a long time & it would
not answer for us to be running to the shops
every hands then, either for food or clothing.
Biddy - It's happy for you Winny & happy
for your family that you took such a sober
notion early - for myself I was always
fond of a bit of dress & Paddy loved company.
It's no one can call him a drunkard, but he
nor Father were never the people to have a thing

& want it. They were the pleasant times
when we met at the dance or when he used to
treat me to the best he could lay his hands
upon & thought nothing was good enough for me.
Winny - I wonder he thought your cabbin good
enough for you.
Biddy - Oh! he was always used to[deletion] that[/deletion] the like
of it & so was I; but I wish it had been
our luck to have more 'cuteness in time
The principle of forsight here inculcated is excellent; & to implant
it nothing wd be more useful than a [underline]School of Industry[/underline] which I think
may be established with great effect in the school Room where the
laundry School is to be kept. Knitting, sewing, spinning wool & flax
besides the straw plait and any other occupation your active kindness
might suggest for the improvement occupation & eventual establishment
of the young Girls of the neighbourhood might there be carried on. Your
Father says he will put a floor into the Room so that during the
winter Evenings much progress might be made in defiance of
the cold and the Room itself is so centrally & advantageously
situated that it is accessible to the whole neighbourhood.
