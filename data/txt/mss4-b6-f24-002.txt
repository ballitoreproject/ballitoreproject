thy absence ...

Dearly respected Friend
It was not want of will, nor I hope of a due
sense of gratitude for the favour which thou conferred on me, which
prevented my acknowledging [deletion]it long ago[/deletion] thy kind condescension
in writing to me long ago; but whenever I thought of it, I could
not but consider the great distance between us, & though thou wert
so kind as to receive one letter from me, I could not have the presumption
to hope that thy time, so much better employed, would be
often devoted to the perusal of my sentiments, unworthy of such
a favour; but in thy letter thou [deletion]acc[/deletion] charges me with stamping
thy friendship at too high a rate, if it be a fault. I must be pardoned,
having imbibed it from my Parents, being from my infancy
taught by them to look upon Saml.. Neale as the friend of our
family, & to prize his friendship, a fresh instance of which thou
hast shown in thy letter to me, which I hold more precious
than gold, & which I hope may be as bread cast upon the waters -
Father, Mother, Samuel Spavald, Thos. Carrington, E Pike, Cousin
Saml. Carleton, & I + got to Kildare the night of the day on which 
[deletion]we[/deletion][insertion]thou[/insertion] parted us at Edenderry, & were at meeting in Athy next
day, where Saml. Spavold was very large in testimony, [deletion]also as[/deletion]
he was [insertion]at meeting [/insertion]here [deletion]next day[/deletion] [insertion]the day following[/insertion], & many said he told the secrets of their
hearts.... He is now in Dublin I suppose, [deletion]with[/deletion] Thos.. Carrington gone
to Waterford. We had letters from Cousin Betsy Shannon [unclear]since [/unclear]
[unclear]turned[/unclear], she did not mention the health of the family, by which
may suppose she did not think of sickness - she bemoaned
[unclear]my[/unclear] absense much, & [deletion]wished for the[/deletion] seemed to be very anxious
for thy return, she mentioned two more presentations of marriage
with them, one of which was a young woman of thy family.
I wrote to Betsy & delivered the message thou were so kind to
charge me with.

By a letter from my Sister Debby we were concerned to hear
that Joseph Garratt had lost his little daughter: it must have [unclear]been[/unclear]
a trial to them; but not [deletion]such a one[/deletion] so severe as are allotted to some
others: that which was lately sent to us was a heavy affliction; but the
arm which struck the blow prevented from sinking under it - I
expect this will meet thee at Lisburn - We shall hope to have the
pleasure of seeing thee here at thy return, if poor Ballitore can have
so much of the power of attraction Father, Mother, Cousin S:[unclear]C S:[unclear]Car[/unclear]
& sister join in dear love to thee [insertion]& thy companion[/insertion] - Cousin Wm.. Rayner [deletion]to[/deletion] desires
thou may accept his respects - I am with much [deletion]respect[/deletion] [insertion]esteem[/insertion]
thy affectionate & obliged
Ballitore: 13/10mo : 1778
