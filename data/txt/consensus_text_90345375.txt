How many tons of water it would take to water an acre.
T and Aunt E. He also met R Allen
and his lady. This is very very
dry weather, we have had little or no
rain since the beginning of last month.
Philip was telling us his turnips were
changing from their nice green to a
a very brownish tint, so Charlie proposed
watering the [insertion]field[/insertion] artificially, whereupon on Papas
suggestion Phil began to calculate how
many tons of water it would take to
water an acre - I giving each square inch
Â½ an inch of water which would be little
enough.
Another piece of information I learned
was that a stone fell at the rate of
32 feet a second - Now I wonder
very much if it would not depend
a little on the weight of the stone.
16th.. Tho' Papas' cold is anything but well he
would go to town to day - Charlie did not
come out this evening. -
