My dear aunt
Betsy says she enclosed the plait in
a letter to thee - Lydia continues finely &
was so well that James slept with her
last night - 7th. Lydia still better, tho'
the weather is uncommonly severe: my
aunt Lydia was poorly yesterday & to-day
bade me give her love to thee & ask thee
to buy her an iron pot to hold 2 gallons
& a small tin kettle, & [insertion]small[/insertion]tin cullender: my aunt
is well enough to be down stairs to-day, [unclear]yet[/unclear]
she complains a little - Fanny Bewley & Betsy
Barrington went to Mt.melick to day - I know
not when Deborah goes. I am to take her
at M. Naughtons with M Pike this evening
so I shall not envy you your happiness
I was at T. Bewleys last eve, where I enjoyed the
company of "the friends" who left us to-day.
This day a shop lifter took a small piece
of calico out of E Barrington's shop, but
Mary Pike pursued her & took it from her
was not that courageous? The woman

is sent, with a constable to Killcullen.
I have no more [underline]news[/underline] to [unclear]mund[/unclear] day
Farewell dearly,
thy
EL
please give my love to
M.H.

Betsy says her [underline]uncle[/underline] may extract so as
her name may not appear; she trusts
to thy Prudence.
