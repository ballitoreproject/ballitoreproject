3rd day Morning 1st of 12th mo: 1829
My dear Sarah
I am commissioned to
convey to thee very sorrowful tidings -
I got a note from Elizabeth this morning,
who was at Moore last night
she says of dear Deborah - "Our hopes
and fears for her precious life ended
a quarter before two this morning -
as peacefully as it was possible - [unclear][/unclear]
an hour before she complained [unclear][/unclear]
great pain in the belly & asked [unclear]ed[/unclear]
we do nothing to relieve her, - but
at the last she sighed lower, & lower
until breath ceased without disturbing
a muscle" - Betsy was with her also.
I hope the letter [deletion]thou got[/deletion] [insertion]that went[/insertion] last night
prepared thee for this shock - I would
have written to thee last night but
that I saw [unclear]F Cole[/unclear] adding to it -

Poor Mary feels this exceedingly
thine very affectionately
[unclear]AWright[/unclear]
[underline]In great haste[/underline]

Dublin
[deletion][/deletion] 1st day evening the Doctor did not
apprehend danger, but all day yesterday
thought unfavourably of her - She
fainted frequently during the day and
vomited repeatedly - Similar to that when
thou wert here - alass poor Elizabeth
