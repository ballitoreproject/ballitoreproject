My dear Eliza
Last night Richard brought out thy
letter to Lucy. I had been expecting one to us, as
the time was come, but must wait sometime
longer for it I suppose. I am sorry to hear thou
hast been so poorly, it is too bad to be knocked back
now when the time is drawing near for thee
 to come home. My Mother says she is very uneasy
about thee from the account thou gives of thyself
from Lucy's letter and from what Sarah saw
She wonders at thee going out with the children
to walk, it would be fatiguing to a person that was
quite well & what must it have been to thee she
is afraid thou wilt be laid up there but I trust that
wilt not be, and hope that a little rest will restore
thee. do nurse thyself and come home to us in thy
best fashions. We are all well here my Mother is
finely, thou hast heard of them in Werburgh street
 so I need say nothing of them. R & E are finely &
thou little daughter. Richard expects to be off to London
shortly. Aunt Jane is out with them to day, they

all drank tea here this evening, and Edward, Maggy &
[unclear]Neyer[/unclear] came out to tea, we did not expect anyone at all
 the day was so wet, but the evening cleared up. Aunt [unclear]F[/unclear]
goes in tomorrow. John & Martha dined here on
first day & Thomas Henry the first time he was here
since thou went. he has recovered the money from
Morgan. Frederic was here also. R & E drank tea here
it is not often we have had Richard & John here together
I went into town with J & M they had their car out
so I slept [insertion]for[/insertion] the first time at Dominick street and staid
there till third day as Martha said she would be going
to Dalkey for Bessy Henry that day & would leave me at
home, which she did. when we got to the glen we found
no one but my Mother, the boys amongst whom was
Saml. Wright, and nearly all the men having gone
[unclear][/unclear] Wright, and nearly all the men having gone
to the caves of Bray they were not home till evening.
Richard went too but said he was disappointed in them
Thou must know I have been so extravagant
as to get a habit, it was to get some alteration made
in the body which I had given to a tailor that
I went to town the skirt I made myself -
Edward told us this evening that Sarah had brought
thee out to Moone, do keep qui[insertion]e[/insertion]t there and dont
exert thyself, thou art to send me some news
from it don't disappoint me. We went to meeting
yesterday, and called at the Parade where we

saw Mary Gamble she had come to try & get them
to go in & spend the day with her. Cousin Betty looks
very well, Susan only middling, she has been at [unclear]Geoghams[/unclear]
poor Fanny is gone, she was taken ill suddenly
in the morning and was dead before night, some
inward complaint there were three physicians with
her, Susan said the body had been opened and that
they said nothing would have prevented it, poor thing
she was within two months of her confinement.
When she was taken ill she expressed as much as
to say it was all over with her. We afterwards
called at J Perry's. Henry & Susan went to [insertion]the[/insertion] London
meeting and have not yet returned. they are all
in dirt at J Perry's as they have carpenters
masons & painters all at work. I don't
envy them the job, however they will
feel pleasant when it is all over. there are
very many enquiries about thee & when
wilt thou be home, it is a long time now since
thou went. there has been some very refreshing
rain which will make the country look still more
beautiful, and will lay the dust which was most
unbearable. I suppose you have had it down in
your past of the country. It is fixed that the
next book meeting is to be held here which will
be on the second of next month, I suppose thou
wilt be home before that and here to entertain
some of the bachelors if any should come, thou

knows I was never very clever at that & my hand
seems out now entirely, as there is no one to practise on
how sad that our eyes are never gladdened by the sight
of such a two-legged-animal, well we can do without
them. I sometimes wish for one when I want
an escort, but I am not often gratified in my
wish. I may say for my comfort, "blessed are they
that expect [underline]little[/underline] for they shall not be disappointed"
I think it should be [underline]nothing[/underline] instead of [underline]little[/underline], for often
even the little is disappointed. The day I was
in town with Martha she had a visit from
Tom Henry. He is a nice little dapper fellow
rather approaching to [unclear]finian[/unclear], however he

seems agreeable and chatty. Mary Gough has sent in her
resignation to the book Society, I saw my Aunt the other
day she is middling was complaining of a pain in her jaw
My Aunt Fayle is very ill I heard with her bowels. I have
not been at Nicholas street very lately, the children have
had the Scarletina give my dear live to Cousin Betsy
and Elizabeth and accept a large share from thy affection
Sister Selina
Write soon for I do not reckon Lucy's letter to us
at all, poor Lucy she was greatly cast down about
the child, I never saw her much worse indeed she lets
herself get too low, I think what a fine thing it is to have
so much over, and how thankful we ought to be that he
was so well able to bear the operation for he was a very
stout little fellow, and sure if he had been a weak child
it could not have been done nearly so soon, and waiting
till he was older would be much worse & a great deal
harder for her to bear I think as it has been every thing
seems to have been made easy. Little Emmy is finer
