My dear Mother
You see we are getting on
we arrived here about 1/4 of an hour ago from
Liege - from which place I wrote to you yesterday
I also wrote to you from London & Liverpool so thus
I have not been idle in that way - we have
met with very agreeable [insertion]people[/insertion] travelling and as
we have in one of them a person who has
travelled an immensity & is going to [unclear][/unclear]
& I cannot tell how many other place - he
has mentioned a route by wh we can get
quicker to Dresden two days than the
we laid out ourselves and we are going
to put it in practice by joining him and
his companion & porting to Dusseldorf and
[deletion]taking[/deletion] & going through Hanover & Berlin
instead of Frankfort - we are not going to
stop now to see any thing here - Thos. is so
anxious to get on - and I think it much better
to do so when we have such company
the Gentleman is from London his name Goldener

[deletion][/deletion] he is a very agreeable lively
man - & speaks a number of Languages so
what whilst with him we cannot be at a loss
about anything - his companion is a Mr Henry
but we cannot find out any relationship tho
his family were originally from Ireland
we passed through a very pretty country today
and the weather is most beautiful tho a
hard frost last night and snow in many
places still lying on the ground - [insertion]some of[/insertion] our muffling
is so far an incumbrance but I dare say
we shall be glad to have it tonight as we
travel all night - had poor Emy been
well enough she would not have suffered
from the cold as yet but the quick travelling
would most likely have been too much
for her - I was called away from this
to dinner - first soup, then fish - then Beefsteak
then venison, roast fowl, Sour crout & spinage &
preserved plums - rice pudding (most excellent)
oranges apples walnuts sweet cake & confections
2 kinds of white & a red wine, all with unpronouncable
names - none of them Vin Ordinaire but
all chosen by the [insertion]strange[/insertion] Gentleman by name - that is by Doctor
Bushman & Mr Goldener - Doctor Bushman is the [unclear]gentleman[/unclear]
I told you in my letter from Liege that we met at Dover
after I wrote my letter yesterday he told his name to Thos
we did not know it before - we part from him this
evening but he gave us an invitation to go see him at
Weisbaden where his family is & where they will
be all summer - he has been over in England seeing
his mother I believe - he is a retired London physician
Living on his money on the continent he has several
children - he is quite a gentleman in appearance &
manner & has written some work on the water cure
establishments wh. he is to sent Thos. a copy of - Thos.
so far from keeping to himself as he does at home (except
to those he is very intimate with) is quite at his ease &
speaks to every one he meets when opportunity offers
we are here a party of six & I may say have been
so since we arrived at Ostend - Dr Bushman Mr
Goldener & Mr Henry were on board the Dover steamer
with us from England - the fourth gent I forget his name
joined us in the steam carriage - (after all I mentioned
before here comes coffee most excellent for coffee but I would
rather have dear tea) he is an english man, young and I
think a clergyman not either very interesting or agreeable
but gentlemanly - I have not time to write to anyone
else so will be obliged by your letting our friends know
about us - we are taking little or no rest being in bed late
and up early & are to travel all night to night - with very
dear love to you & all my dear mother I am your affect daughter
EH
