Allow me dear Friend to return you
my most greatful thank for yours
and your familys politeness to thy
much Esteemed friend Mr. L Strange
he arrived here safe on Saturday
much pleased with his many pleasing
conversations with his Friends the Quakers
and is Charmed with Elizabeths
Elegance of manner there is no
better judge as Mr. L Strange is
in the first society - you will be
the death of my much lamented
friend Mr. R. Wickson in the
papers his Sister and Brother &
quite inconsolable nor will I be
able to leave them for some Short
time his remains have not yet
arrived he has left a noble fortune
to his family - please to tell W.L.
to give his Bill and Mary & my
to James on the 4. of next month

and in the main time to give
James any thing that may be
wanted I have not been able
to go out since I arrived but
will in a few days so if you
have any business to be done
in Town command me and
I will attend to it with
pleasure. I saw Mr Champion
once and had a letter from my
Daughter who is particularly anxious
for us to be reconciled this May
shortly take place if I can bring
myself to do [underline]perhaps[/underline] what I [underline]ought[/underline]
but I have my doubts whether
I ought or [underline]not[/underline] and now that my
mind is made up to all trials
and [deletion][/deletion] [insertion]Thus I am[/insertion] more at ease than
Ever I Expected it to be I must take
time to consider whether or not I
will once more be happy with

a husband who left me to my own
care and to the neglect of a unfeeling
[underline]world[/underline] - I may say I have heard in
sorrow and solitude for the last
[unclear]few years[/unclear] yet I assure you it
was not for the want of some of
the most respectable people being
able to introduce me but to
be candid it was not my wish
as in the melancholy state
of mind I was in & my
brains Small retirement
was all I sought for but Even
in Balytore the malicious Tongue
of Envy could not let me pass - yet it
is a pleasing effliction it was but
one family who are boath insidious
and vulgar when unfortunately for
me I first judged on account of my
dear boys - but before I take a final
leave of Ballytore they shall be
brought to what they meant that
is [underline]shame[/underline] for their conduct toward
[underline]me.[/underline] I nearly lost my life by them
pardon I beg of you my trespassing

on your time and believe me with
my respect your greatful friend

P.s you will much oblige me to tell
James if he call you had a letter and
that I will write in a day or tow
