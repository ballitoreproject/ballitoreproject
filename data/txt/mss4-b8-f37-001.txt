Kilduff 27 of 11 mo: 1816
My Dear Wm.
As my Father is indebted to me on Account of
my Annuity, I requested him either to hand me
some of it to silence the Widow Doyle, or to [unclear]secure[/unclear]
her- which last he agreed to provided she would
accept it [unclear]@[/unclear] [underline]4[/underline] years - This was the purport of her
Offer at first to take [unclear]@[/unclear] £[underline]16[/underline] a year, which would
have taken 4 1/2 years to clear it off- This was in May
last, she cannot now therefore have any objection
to this Offer, being the same which she wished herself
The rent of [underline]9[/underline] Mo: 1815 I left with her to settle an
extra account. therefore [deletion]therefore[/deletion] there remains
3rd- and 9 Mo: [underline]1816[/underline] now due, and in her hands
towards my Bile- this leave a Balance on the
Bill of about £[underline]56 due[/underline]- which would be about
£14 a year to be paid. I would thank you if you
would as [underline]soon as you can[/underline] see her, and tell her
that my Father is now willing on these terms to
secure her the Balance without any [underline]Interest[/underline] a Cost
and

to divide it into four equal parts one [unclear]part[/unclear] payable
every year, [deletion]byorhalf[/deletion]- the first [underline]half[/underline] year payment to
be next 6th. Mo: and the next 1st. Mo: [unclear][/unclear] and so on this
dividend to be paid [unclear][/unclear] yearly payments in those
two Months till all is paid- if she wishes this
he desires her to draw up an instrument to that
Effect, and send down here by the Shop Boy, together
with the Bile [underline]receipted[/underline]- and he will settle
with her. he desired me to desire the Boy to set
off early that he might go back again as there
is no Bed here for him -
I wish you would prevail on her, how that she
can be secured to come to a settlement -
I hope Mary, Sally and all yr. family are [unclear]well[/unclear]
Remember me affectionately to them and all other
friends - If all was clear in that quarter I
would be aft to go and see you- in yr. last
you told me Richard Alen had some money for
me in Town- what money is it? for Josh. Abel
in a short time after writes me that he had
the price of the Encyclopedia I suppose, for me
which is all I know of- when you write which
I hope will be Soon, direct to me to my [unclear][/unclear]
I expect to be in Town Soon and Remain D [unclear][/unclear]
Your very sincere friend
[unclear]PA[/unclear] North -
