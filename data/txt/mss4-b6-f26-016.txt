Mt. melick 6 / 6 mo: 1788
I am not at all displeased with my dear 
friend for answering my letter, on the contrary I was much
pleased to hear of your welfare, and also gratified with
the account of the province meeting. - If I know my
own mind, my reason for mentioning about thy writg
to me was, for fear I should be instrumental in
making thee do what was not altogether agreeable
to thy mind, & to take off the request, for I know
thou does not like to refuse my requests if at all
in thy compass (thou sees I am still conceited)
therefore wished to make it so, as if I did not ask
thee - how I believe thou wrote for more reasons
than one - for I believe thou knew it would
please me to hear from thee, & therefore thou
wrote: I dont at all doubt but thou knows me
better than I know myself, better than Betsy
however, I see. This day was our M. Meetg. I belve.
a favoured season to some, held till after 5 O
Clock. I heard from Nancy Shannon who had a 
Letter

Letter from S. Shackleton & A. L. informing that thou
was likely to be in Cork soon, if so, please to remember
me to Mary A. who will I dare say be well
pleased to see thee, for thou art a favourite of
her's; I heard last post from her, they were all
pretty [insertion]well[/insertion], she likely to lie in sometime this month,
'tis almost dark. I can scarce see to write, indeed
I may stop, for I have nothing worth sending -
I expect I [insertion]am[/insertion] nothing worse in health - farewell.
my dear love to the girls - thy companions -
Wm. Leadbeater.

Benjamin Grub,
Clonmel.
