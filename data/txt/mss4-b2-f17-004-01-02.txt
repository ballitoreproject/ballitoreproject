From the same to the same.

My dear friend,
+++ I am now returned to my own old home, & my old clothes  I am come away from the princes & princesses  I am descended from the wholesale to the retail-business  But I feel rather animated & strengthened in spirit by a communication with the worthies, whose company I was in. Thus the great creator casts up & provides means of renovation of his work  he renews the face of the earth. May he often renew thy trust & confidence in him, beloved friend, & animate thee by his quickening Spirit to persevere in the faithful discharge of manifested duty! I want not to set thee up above the standard of Truth - I love a state of humility for myself - & I delight to see & feel my dear friends in the same  but, (may I say) thy increasing diligence & fidelity in the Lords work, what I have observed, & what I have heard of thy going in & out before the people, thy publick labours, & thy private admonitions, thy prayers & thy alms-deeds in a religious sense, these have been as marrow to my bones, & feelingly increased my spiritual attachment to thee in the sacred, mysterious bond. Therefore I salute thee, my dear friend, in renewed affection, & bid thee God speed! May he speed & prosper his own work, and thee therein! The great Masters command was, Lift up your eyes, & look on the fields - and I believe if the servants would attentively look about them [page number] 264 they would find plenty of work necessary to be done, fields white to harvest - . Diligent labour would also bring in good pay, & a cheerful, placid, contented state of mind would be the happy consequence.
	I suppose thou hearst sometimes from our dear friends * on the continent of Europe  I have a secret hope that they will be helped along in their service, & that the precious seed, the heavenly grain, scattered by divine direction, will not be all lost, but will in some ground, some well-prepared, fallow ground, be fruitful unto holiness, & vegetate to eternal life.
+++Remember me affectionately to thy husband  I hope thou & he & your little flock are now all well. My wife & children be sure bear thee much love.
	
I am, with brotherly affection,
thy faithful friend
Richard Shackleton
