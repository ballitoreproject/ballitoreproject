Most respected & Esteemd Fiend
May I trouble thee to ask thee if thou
Knoows where I could hear of an Herb that grandfather
Webster used to smile when attacked by cramps
He had it in the Garden at the Bridge & it grew
up like a small flagger & I believe that He gave a
plant off it to thy Reverd [unclear]Manra[/unclear] -
most respected Freind
I remain thy
Obliged & Humble
