Kilesandra, County Cavan
Madam,
Derry lane School, June 14th .. 1826
I take the liberty of informing you that I have
lately removed from Moate to this place, where my Wife and
I superintend a School (exclusively) under the Patronage of Lord
and Lady Farnham - We are situated very comfortably, having
Forty Pounds per Annum with excellent apartments in the School, in
addition there are three acres of Land with a sufficiency of Bog
for turf. I now write to you, hoping you will be so kind as
to send me Mrs. Bonhams address - I am sure Mr. George
Shackelton will be able to give it you - My friends are still
inexorable, perhaps you could let me know how they are. It has pleased
God to bless us with a little son - we enjoy very good health, and,
blessed by God, are endeavoring for the Kingdom.
things necessary for [underline]time [/underline]and [underline]Eternity [/underline]is the Prayer of,
That the Lord may bless you and your family with all
things necessary for [underline]time [/underline]and [underline]Eternity [/underline]is the Prayer of,
Madam,
Your obedient Servant
Patrick Cauning
