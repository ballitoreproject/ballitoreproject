My Dear Cousin        


        I had intended taking up my pen to write thee this day - had I not reciv'd thy very acceptable letter - dated the 6th which has afforded me much comfort - for your welfare is a subject my heart is nearly concernd about - and it seemd long since I was favoured with one of thy instructive letters 
        Since I wrote my Beloved Friend SS - my allotment - has been mostly in the sick Chamber - the 3rd of last month my Brother Darbys eldest Son was took ill with a Putrid fever, and Died the next evening - and on the 21st my Dear Father was seized with a Paralatick [sic] stroke, his breathing was chiefly affected and he lingerd [sic] until the 10th of this month when he sweetly closed, having bore his illness with instructive patience - and resignation - frequently saying he was easy - as to the event - seeing nothing in his way - thus my Dear Friend - the end with respect to him seems to have crownd[?] all - & tho I feel the tyes [sic] of nature - to be strong - & binding - I can & do feel thankful - for his removal from pain - & conflict - to that rest - which is prepard for the righteous  I thought thou would wish me to address thee on the present occasion - as a kind Relation - & sympathizing Friend - my Dear Mother bears her loss - as well as might be expected - tho is but in a poor state of health - my Sister Rachel is at present with her - my own health has also sufferd - but am getting better again

R. Young has been with us three weeks, left us Yesterday, S Appleby knows she may give her Dear Love, with her own, to Dear R Shackleton, & all his Family 


Thou seems from thy letter to be filling up - in thy measure that which remains of the sufferings of Christ - & as there is fellowship in it - there is much consolation in having Companions in a way - so trying to our natures - and I think I never was sensible of greater deprivations than this Winter - yet I have at times been comforted in hope - that all things might work together for good. & it is the earnest desire of my heart - that none of his gracious designs respecting me - may be frustrated  however better the cup handed - the Servant is not greater than his Master, or the Disciple then his Lord - & we must according to our strength follow Him - even to Mount Calvary - & have in an agony of spirit to cry out - my God - my God - why has thou forsaken me - I am lead on in the freedom of friendship - beyond my expectation, I know thou art an indulgent Father - & watches over the Children of thy Heavenly Fathers family with a skillful patience - & amongst this number - I wish I was more worthy to be ranked 
        Thou cannot give me too particular an account of thy own family - they are all very Dear to me - both for thy sake & their own - & am thankful - I have seen you at your respective homes - as it enables me to pay you mental visits with more ease - I also remember with gratitude the many marks of kindness extended to us - & wish to be so preservd near our great center - as that tho absent in Body - we may be present in spirit - and one anothers Joy in the Lord 
I am glad to hear of the Religious visit paid to the families in Cork - I hope it will tend to the releife of the seed - & setting at liberty Captive spirits  & then the living will be comforted  tell Dear James Able - I wish him not to hide himself - beyond devine appointment - for it is not a day - for any rightly anonted Servant - to withhold their help - the Harvest truly is plenteous - and the faithful labourers few - please to give AS. & my dear Love to him - 
          I may answer for both my late Valuable Companion and my self - that we remember our Friends in your Land in a general manner - with much regard - & many of you with the strongest affection - & have a secret hope - that the good work so graceously [sic] begun - will be carried forward to the praise of Him - who is yet bestowing Gifts on Sons - & Daughters give our Endeard Love to every branch of thy family - thy excellent Wife - will I hope sometimes remember us for good, as conflecting [?] Servants - & more especially - put up her prayers for my preservation - who am but a Child 
        tell Dear S.S. I expect she will invite me & always consider me - as affectionately interested in her growth - & establishment in the Truth - thy Son Abraham - has not told me - I am ranked amongst his Friends - but I know he has a large heart & will sometimes give me a place 
        Dear EPims[?] welfare is also precious to me - please to convey our Love to Clonmell as due - & tell EP [?] I expect her to write me 
thou must excuse my enlarging more - then that
