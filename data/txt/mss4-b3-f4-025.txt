My dear Uncle

	A frank going to Ballitore I am unwilling but to let it convey my token of love to friends there, not that I wish to be seen in every worthy exploit, for it I know my own heart it is my desire to know my own business & simply to do it, whether it is taken cognizance of or not by the truly wise & honorable; whose friendship though strengthning [sic], consoling & therefore acceptable, may if the heart is not in some degree redeemed & redeeming from the mysterious working of selflove [sic], be perverted, & instead of nourishing the pure immortal part, build us up in an airy notion of our own merits & attainments & prove a snare instead of a blessing  Ah my dear Uncle! a little acquaintance with ones own human nature, a frequent detection of its corruption & the perplexities into which it introduces us, when its subtle arguments prevail, are enough to weary out a mind blessed with the least sincere aspiration after permanent good, durable ^riches^ & righteousness, & to content us in the most obscure situation, if through unmeritted [sic] mercy it may but be in the courts of the Lord, the coarsest food if but ministered to us from the hand which is full of blessings & the most unpleasant work if faith is but vouchsafed that in love & in pity it will be accepted  some of us here feel it to be a low time  my knees often are ready to smite together, & my soul is exceeding sorrowful!  that there are causes in myself & circumstances attending our present situation I doubt not  give me wisdom & reject me not from amongst thy children is my secret petition; for wisdom, patience faith & every other christian virtue are essentially ^necessary^ in that composition, that acceptable & consequently humle frame of spirit, which is (like the special gift of those who are ordered of God as was Aaron) made after the art of the apothecary
	But one principal reason of my writing was to inform thee that I received thy letter for my beloved R.J. & intend sending it with a samplar [sic], a wrought salutation to her on her return, which the the [sic] girls have near finished, & which we hope will catch the vessel before it sails, understanding that it was detained for some wanted repairs  I had ^sent^ several things in a 
parcel before thy letter came but I trust the vessel will be honoured with conveying thy salutation & our packets will not go the less safe  Tis a fine thing to be in good company at sea 
	Our dear sister Margaret recovers finely  she has today a little touch of the colic but I hope it will not be of much consequence  the children are finely as are ours
	In a letter we received from G. Dillwyn last 6th day dated ^London^ 11th month 7th is the following paragraph  One affecting visit has lately been paid to the city by dear M. Gurney (Cs sister). She had been with Sarah Rudd on an errand to the westward, & on their return called at Staines where Mary had to drink so deep of the waters of Marah, that she wished there to have laid down her life. But this was to prepare her for what was to follow. About the 13th ultimate she came to J.G Bevans, where I found my mind so bound in sympathy to her that I took up my quarters under the same roof, & at her particular desire attended her to all the meetings of the city, to Wandsworth & some private families. She entered deep into her service telling me she had often before been at; but never as then in London. As she went along she appeared [hole in paper] more releived [sic], & the 28th rode to Plaist[covered by seal] where she was on her feet about an hour, & afterwards had a considerable opportunity at James Shepherds. The same evening she felt herself poorly & next day was confined to her bed. The 1st instant J Pemberton & I visited her: she appeared calm & resigned to the event; & the evening of the next day at about 8 oclock expired. The account of her removal which reached me next morning was attended with a remarkable sweetness to my mind & with a lively remembrance of those expressions I was a stranger & ye took me in. Indeed the reflexion that I was permitted to bear up the hands of this sincere hearted disciple so near the close of her service is an occasion of thankfulness, for the peace it affords.
George also says that J Pemberton is in London in a very tried spot & that L. Hawksworth is declining & in such a state of health that her recovery is despaired of but that her mind is wonderfully borne up above her bodily complaints & yet preserved in singular humility & tenderness  These are all subjects of mournful mediation  may infinite compassion so accompany us through our pilgrimage, unerring counsel ^be^ so afforded & we wisely accept it as that counting nothing too near or too dear, we may also finish our course with joy  My R.G. sister Elizabeth AB & E Fayle [?], also Anne Grubb desire to unite in the salutes of dear love & they do my dear Uncle unfeignedly flow to thee & thine from thy poor but affectionate SR Grubb
