My dear Elizabeth
As Sarah is most likely
at home just now, I am obliged to trouble
you with a line [deletion][/deletion] to day that I intend
Sending by the early coach to [unclear]pressorn[/unclear]
morning a small box containing
two fish which I request you will
heat as they deserve for I am afraid
they are not as nice as I would wish.
I also propose sending with the same
a small parcel for Sarah which
you will have the goodness to let
have when convenient, no hurry [unclear][/unclear]
I expect as I have not heard to the
contrary that you are all well, please
present my best respects where they are
due and return me yours very
affectionately
Edw Barrington
When do you mean to send back
my people to me. I suppose I
must send down a writ of Habeas Corpus to make them appear
