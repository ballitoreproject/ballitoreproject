My dear Molly
Thy well known Placability emboldens me
to addup the once know after such a very long silence
a silence as surprising to me as it can be to thyself
concious it was by no mean occasioned by want of
the most ardent affection which I attent would be proved
by me in any manner that lay in my power sooner
than by letter writing however I should surmount what
ever obstacles my essetolary disqualification throw in
my way if it was not for a multitude of affairs
which press upon me in one continued train & distract
me in such a manner as to make me appear forgetfull
of my dearest connexion - I hear with much pleasure
of thy intended trip acoss the water I hope thy
expectations may be fully answerd take care not
to let any of the English Swans delain thee from us

Thy last letter conveyed me the first intelligence of Sam Eyres
I assure thee I was not a little shocked on unfolding the
enclosure when I found it to be an Elegy on one I supposed
earning Laurels in the service of his Country. Many
of my Ballitore acquaintances have fallen victims to relentless
Death yet how much is that to be preferred to the life
some are devoted to drag along - that poor wretch
Macauly was about this town for some days begging
dussed in sailors attere - I was showed him but did
not recollect his features & did not covet be be made
known to him - I am sorry thou had the trouble
about those Volumes of Ossian as thou seemed to like
them I was in hope they would find a place in
thy Closet - I not received them yet - Pray is there
any truth in a report I hear that Betty Leeky
has a notion of wrestling for [underline]thy Blessing[/underline] with
a probability of success too nay I have heard
she is to be a companion of his studies in Edinburgh
I thank thee for the Poetry thou wert kind enough

to send & at thy return shall hope to be favoured
with all I have not yet seen might I hope
for a line before thy departure to inform me
of the tour you propose to take as I suppose
it will be some thing more than simply going
& returning - Please remeber me affectionately to
Coussin Sally Birkbuk & her good man - I shall
now take my leave wishing thee a satisfactory excursion
My dear love to all at home
Thine sincerely
William [unclear]Rayner[/unclear]
