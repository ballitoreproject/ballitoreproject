My Dear Mary
I rcd. thy [unclear][/unclear] or eulogy for wch. wth many more
of thy favors my thanks are due - I am so bad a judge of poetry as
not to be able freely to understand this - however I can understand
so much of it as to know there is a great deal too much in
my favor & too little in that of our dear lamented friend
this thou canst or perhaps hast compensated for in some other
work or elegy to the memory of this beloved & amiable
woman - where memory will long service her short course
My new Complaint is rapidly amending - the remainder of
our family all well Saml intends accompanying our relatives
Richd & Susan Grubb to Dublin in the morning - we expect
Jane & her little Edmund to come wth Saml to spend some
time wth us - my hand is not yet in. to write long letters
this is the first of friendship since my convalescence
excuse me to our dear Betsy [insertion]S[/insertion] - I hope soon to see her in
Carlow when we can settle all surmises comfortably
none of an evil tendency existing
thine Affectionately
Saml Haughton
