Richmond 1st of June 1826
My very dear Sister
I could not let an opportunity
pass of letting you know how we are getting
on, for it is some time now since any words
passed between us- I am happy to say our dear
Lyd is almost completely recovered- She is able
to walk from this into town as she did yesterday
altho a sultry day- Her hair is growing & her
looks have resumed their old appearance- She is
quite gay and hearty- We have not heard from Ballitore
for nearly a fortnight & are anxious to hear
[deletion]how[/deletion] our dear mother proceeds - I am inclined to
hope favorably or I think they wont hardly have
us without letters. I like [deletion]aIl[/deletion] always to try & hope
the best - bad news travels fast enough, not to anticipate
it. Are we to expect Edward or you or
both of you here this summer. Edward must
not forget his proposal of visiting Connaught - It
hope I shall be able to [underline]foot[/underline] it with him through

our Irish Highland - We heard of your fathers excursion
with Edward & Eben to the suspension Bridge &
were glad to know he was so well as to make such
an effort. We have not heard of their return. This
will show you how much in the dark our good friend
keep us. You are so near Ballitore that you
are privy to all their schemes. I am quite up
to my eyes, as the saying is, in Bees. I got a stock
this spring, one hive, & have had one fine swarm
from them & am daily expecting another - Lydia
and I went out last night at ten o'clock to hear them
& I went out last night at ten o'clock to hear them
giving warning. week- week- week- Lydia is
engaged very much this fine season with her flowers
of which she is as fond as ever, nay I believe fonder
Yesterday I attended old Samuel Alexander's funeral
he died after an illness of 24 hours... The children
are finely, Joze advancing in knowledge & a great
favorite with our neighbours, which is a [underline]good sign-[/underline]
little M.L. is thriving apace but does not show a tooth
yet, she does not yet run about, & I doubt if she will
until she leaves off her long frocks- ha! ha! why dont

you laugh at my joke. I suppose little Maggy is shooting
up into a fine big girl & that Johnny is quite steady on
his feet. Has he made much progress in his parts
of speech? and how is little WL does he show his
teeth yet? Your High Feast is accomplished, ours
is still to [underline]pass-over -[/underline] A few [deletion]bri[/deletion] weeks will bring
us into the midst of the crowd. I mean the
quarterly meeting. You rogue you did not send
me a line by James Harvey &
never acknowledged my last note -
but I could not expect it as I suppose you had
no leisure during that week - well, well, I shall
not complain if you write very soon, & never
heed postage - a letter is a cheap gratification, cost
what it may, if it be from an absent friend - and
you are "more than friend". Health & happiness
attend you & yours my beloved sister says your
affectionate brother [underline]J.J.F[/underline]
I wish I had time my dearest Sarah to write more to thee
than to come in curtsying [underline]so[/underline] after James, but alas your painters
& a white washer [deletion][/deletion] & a [unclear]painter[/unclear] must be watched verily
as a cat watcheth a mouse Come come & see are we clean
Ah! come my darling. [insertion][unclear]al[/unclear][/insertion] including Maggie I have been intending to
tell thee I was not restored to nearly my usual strength until [underline]very[/underline] lately
even still my hand trembles my knees [unclear][/unclear] my feet swell - but heaven
be praised. We are extremely busy [unclear][/unclear] not here soon
we may have Thomas home. [unclear][/unclear] my father travelling
over England & Wales for I have not heard any thing
from Ballitore this age - [unclear]here[/unclear] her going
[unclear]every[/unclear] one
" And now again I seize the pen ( vide I myth) Dost thou think
[unclear][/unclear] mother really any thing better - the last letter gave me some
more hopes of her recovery at least that she might be left
some years to us. Does she still speak of going to Dublin?
Oh! write my darling if but half a page & tell me what
Dr Harvey thinks of her. I hear very little about any of
you your cabals - your intrigues - we have ours to
[unclear]to[/unclear] great path came & I will give thee a clue to them
So Ellen [unclear][/unclear] again like a musician - like a Phoenix
rather as more [insertion]consonant[/insertion] conferrable to a wedding - well most warmly
do I wish them luck in all their undertakings.
Homey farewell my love [unclear][/unclear] to Edward & to
[unclear]dear Debs[/unclear] when thou sends a [underline]scrap[/underline] [unclear][/unclear] with the East India
sugar from Adam
