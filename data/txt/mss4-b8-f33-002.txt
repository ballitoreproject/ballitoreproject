Dr. William
The bearer Wm. Mullen, has just
called on me saying he & his man had been wth
thee 4 days & gone on agreeably on both sides.
but does not seem willing to continue the
work (having many calls at home) for less wages
than 15/ aweek & have this wages given for
[unclear][/unclear] for.. days all ready spent - he has receivd [unclear]this[/unclear]
the four days allready spent - he has receivd this
Lesson (I apprehend) from the confraternates there - his
demand was 16/3 but in compliance wth my advice
agrees to take 15/ suppose thou had better comply
and dispatch the business soon as possible. I have
spared Mullin from any [unclear][/unclear] work - wch. is standing
till he returns - if thou canst keep him from
drink & supply him wth tobacco - he [deletion]is[/deletion] [insertion]will be[/insertion] an excellent
workman - Dr. love to Molly farewell

Tell Molly I am reading Cowper with delight, the forepart seemed
glowing & enthusiastick wch. I attributed to his [insertion]then weak[/insertion] nervous System
brighter & more exalted prospects now appear - and the more I read
the more my wonder is raised -
