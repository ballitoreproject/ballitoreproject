Dear Cousin.
I Received thy favour of [deletion][/deletion] 5 inst. but thro'
neglect have not answer'd it till now.
Thy correspondence is not in the least
disagreeable to me for it is undoubtedly very
pleasing to me.
I have the dark [unclear][/unclear] till it is
very well I keep it in the bottle & give it fresh
water twice or trice a day it got out of the bottle
a while ago & crept upon the top of the
bottle & I put it in again.
I wrote to my Father the other day
for the books promised me by James
who had not room for them in his pocket

I asked him yesterday when he would go to
Dublin he told me this wee coming on (I
think) & that he would carry a Wallet to
bring them in.
I intend to make more frequent visits.
Shew this to nobody.
I am [unclear][/unclear] Dear Cousin
affectionatelly thine. N. R
PS. Give my love
to all the family
as if mentioned
