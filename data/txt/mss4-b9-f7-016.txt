Dublin 20th April 1838
My Dear Elizabeth.
Rose Lawler called on me
but paid me no rent, I told [insertion]her[/insertion] [unclear][/unclear]
on the subject of the ground and Lease only
delayed doing so, waiting Eben return.
am inclined, as far as any offer we have had
yet for that field, to wait till the houses are
finished and try to set it with one of them.
Please to inform her of our intentions to do as
an answer to her desire to get the field.
[unclear][/unclear] Tim Murphy is [underline]not [/underline]satisfied to pay
per week and [unclear]rejectedly, too[/unclear] for the [unclear]house forge[/unclear] and [unclear][/unclear]
he had better not proceed any further
with the enclosure. Eben can tell all
about [unclear]Ducygaum[/unclear], which I fear is likely
to be a further trouble to us. The [unclear]house[/unclear]
afoins at a stop about the [unclear]henath at[/unclear] property
as my aunt G - is still undecided [deletion]which she[/deletion] [insertion]Jane told[/insertion]
[deletion]informed me.[/deletion] If any one should [unclear]urste[/unclear] to you
on the Subject I think you right to be
very cautious how you reply thereto; and
keep a copy of what you said. I reject you
wrote at all As the Madam Pullin as the best
think we can do now with that part of it
is to let it drop altogether, which we may put [unclear][/unclear]
be able to do if we do not comment [unclear][/unclear]
John Doyle would quite satisfied with Eben's agreement
with him when I was in Ballitore. [deletion][/deletion] I do not clearly
understand your amazement with Mary Flanagan, but expect
it is [unclear]conect[/unclear] it can remain in Status quo till we meet again.
which I hope may be soon Yours affection SB

Elizabeth Leadbeater
Ballitore
