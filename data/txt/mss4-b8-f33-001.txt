Dear William
I recd thy letter, thou art too kind in the liberal offer of the use
of thy chaises - I always prefer the outside of my home wind & weather permitting
[unclear][/unclear] takes a chaise wch. believe we can spare
We had a letter this morning from our Ben: he mentions thy Mary
with affection & Regrets not writing to her oftner- He also mentions
a relation of his wifes having lately returned from America. - The
people there appear extreamly selfish - and Ben: thinks if a reformation
shd. take place in the world. It will not be likely to begin
there. He prefers old Ireland with all its faults - This young man
has also brt. the Melancholy intelligence of the direful exit of
Wm. Crotch - he had visited the families at Philadelphia & mostly
at New York - the poor-man got low in his mind - (and wch. he was
subject to when in Ireland) & put an end to his existance by the barbars
instrument. My wife is much shocked at hearing this dreadful
exit of her old friend - This young man also visited Thos.
Paine who lives near New-york - He queried of him whether he
had not changed his sentiments on some of his former publications
he said [underline] not [/underline] & that he intendid publishing the whole
of his works before he died he appeared to be abt 70 yrs old
He also saw the [unclear]radescblable[/unclear] David Sand - I have not time
Dr Love to Mary &
Sam Haughton
