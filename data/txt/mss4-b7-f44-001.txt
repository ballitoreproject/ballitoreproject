Dublin 12th m: 15th 1792
Dear Mary
I am much obliged to thee for sending to us
for the check, any thing that thou or thy friends
would want in our way we would make them on the
lowest terms, but am sorry we have nothing near the
pattron nor any sort but what is Callendered Nehemiah
would have endeavoured to match the pattron but was so
ingaged he could not get out - its true dear mary we
have lost some of our nearest and dearest friends but
our looss is their great gain I believe, I often think
its happy for them that are gone well out of this
world of trouble there is a dull prospect I fear we
shall meet with troubles and trials that none living
has experienced, dear Samuel Emlin has often warned
us since I came hear, I wish we may be prepared for
that time, its no wonder thy dear mother is often ailing
I think she is wonderfully supported under her great trial
please to [insertion]give[/insertion] our dear love to her and thy Sister sally -
Sally is not at home to day or she would send her [insertion]love[/insertion] to thee
Nehemiah joins in dear love to Wm. and Hannah Hughton and to
thy brother and his family and accept a large share they self from her
who is thy sincere friend Susanna Wright -
