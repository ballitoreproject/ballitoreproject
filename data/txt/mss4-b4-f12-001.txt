My dear Mother
Sally & I arrived safe here about 7 o'clock
the Carriage performed very well - found father
in bed a good deal oppressed in his breathing
but having no other complaint whatever (his
head & bowels very well) - except at times sickness
in his stomach; but in general what he
takes seems to be on it - The Apothecary here
made him up a Julep which he takes, & he has
a blister on his back to relieve his breath, which
has rose very well but is not yet cut - He
desires me to tell thee not to be alarmed, that
his reason tells him it is an heavy cold, which
he hopes, under Providence (when he gets his
body emptied,) will go off - he says his chief
complaint is [underline]bed[/underline], that when he gets up &
gets a little strength he thinks he will be well -
the weariness is gone out of his bones which
he first complained [insertion]of[/insertion] - he has had large perspirations
which I suppose have weakened his
stomach - & as to his b[insertion]r[/insertion]ea[deletion]l[/deletion]th thou knows that
when in health he seems stuffy - the Apothecary

assured me that he saw nothing to alarm
us - however this morning I have hinted
to him the propriety of having some person
of approved skill, who perhaps might by timely
by prescription relieve him more effectually
prescription relieve him more effectually
& speedily - We mentioned several of the
faculty & at last he seemed easiest to have
our Frank Johnson, who he says he believes
knows as much as any of them -
Please therefore to dispatch the Dr.
to us immediately - he may ride my horse
if he please, as I want him here, for if I
find my father better I hope to be home
to morrow morning to meeting - I could
wish thee, dear Mother, not to give way to
unnecessary distress & uneasiness, which must
prove distressing to him - as health & sickness
are in the gift of Providence, we must
cultivate dispositions of gratitude for the one
& acquiescence under the other, endeavouring
to

to submit patiently to the turning of the Lord's
hand, who (it is said) doth not afflict willingly,
nor grieve the Children of Men: when we
are submissive, the end is answered, & he turneth
human events by the secret ways of his Providence, -
he maketh the Storm a Calm, so
that the waves thereof are still.
Please to send Peggy's last letter by the
Doctor - I intend to leave this letter unsealed
For Br & sister's information in Athy
I am thy very affectionate son
PS -
I hope my Lydia will write me a line
& say how they go on at home
