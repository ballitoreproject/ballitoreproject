of Lord Bandon is I believe a [unclear]fine[/unclear]
one and also the castle, but
as it was two miles off our
curiosity was not sufficiently
raised to take such a long
[unclear]way[/unclear], nor our purses long
enough to pay for a car or
rather we wished to keep our
money for things better worth
seeing. After tea the boys
went out fishing, and Magt
soon went to bed as she felt
rather fatigued. The hotel is
very large for such a town
and I think has seen better
days. We think Dublin greatly
behind-hand in her markets
for both in Cork and Queenstown
stalls and we saw a very
nice one at Brandon also -
At about 9Â½ the boys came
At about 9 1/2 the boys came
they had regular market
