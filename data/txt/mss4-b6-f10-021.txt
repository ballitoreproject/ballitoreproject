Carlow 30th Sepr. 1810
Dear Mary
We have been several [insertion]days[/insertion] uneasy
at having no acct of the progress of thy
Deborah's illness - I sent a messenger with
a letter 28th to James White & particularly
Requested he wd inform me, of hers, &
the other invalids state, & to wch Recd..
no reply - Mary Recd.. a short note from
Betsy today - nearly as unintelligent
I wd be glad to have a particular acct.
from thy own hand - indeed my frd.
gratitude (if no more) ought [insertion]to[/insertion] arouse
our feelings on thy behalf - who on a
late trying occasion (as well as many
former ones) displayed so feelingly &
conspicuously the genuine marks of
love & friendship - we are all here in
usual plight thy Affte
Saml Haughton
