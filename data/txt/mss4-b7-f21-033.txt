I have now two letters to thank you for, my dear Friend
& I should sooner have done so, but knowing the pleasure Thos.
Wilkinson takes in reading what you write, I had sent your letter
to him when your second arrived - & as I recollected you had ask'd
many questions I waited for
me many questions I waited for his returning the first, before I
troubled you with an answer - Our good Friend Thos. never does
any thing [underline]rashly[/underline], & so I have only just received it. I will now
begin like a Woman of business methodically, & reply to your
first favor- - I rejoice that you so highly approve of the heapment,
they simply narrate the life of a Superior Being, whose own
sentiments describe the character infinitely more forcibly
than any Editor could do it, however partially disposed towards
her - She was [underline]all[/underline] that the little Book declares her to have
been, & even [underline]more[/underline];- - my head, as well as heart, pronounces her
to have been nearer perfection than human Being I ever saw.
So long as Memory lasts, I must ever Selfishly deplore my own
loss, & ardently wish to rejoin her Blessed Spirit! I know not
how you, & the Belfast Reviewers, have mistaken the Editor, it
[unclear]is[/unclear] my valued Friend Mrs. H. Bowdler - She was the author of
Sermons on the Doctrines [unclear]of[/unclear] Duties of X.nty - but she is now publishing
and Edition in which these blunders will be done away, as the

will appear. Dr. Randolph is the Friend to whom many of my letters
are address'd - I am highly gratified by the Extract of the letter
you send me, your Friend is a Man after my own heart, he writes
exactly on my System; but Mercy on us both, if the Calvinists
read such heretical opinions! pray tell him Watson prints
for us, & I should be very much obliged to him if he could learn
the success of that Edition, for neither Mrs. Bowdler or I have
ever heard - Tell him too, that the Book of Job will be
publish'd, so soon as Dr. Magee has finish'd some Notes he
is writing on it - Your next query relates to Mrs. Hamilton,
her Cottagers are much admired,- I, for [underline]once[/underline] think with the [unclear]Editor[/unclear]:
Reviewers, that a cheap Edition of that part which particularly
relates to Glenburnie should be given (Gratis) by the rich Scotch
To their poor Neighbours,- nor would it do any [underline]harm[/underline] if it was
so dispersed amongst the lower Irish - I own to you, that the
picture drawn, however fine, was to me disgustingly filthy,- it
spoilt my breakfast one Morning, & I believe prejudiced me
against the Work - I had the pleasure of the Author's company
for ten day s Last Summer,- She is a most agreeable Companion,
& a very excellent Woman - I am not personally acquainted with
Mrs. Grant, but many of my particular Friends are - have you seen
her last work, "Memoirs of an American Lady" - I own I think it very

inferior to her letters; they, are written in easy, natural language, &
[unclear]bespeak[/unclear] good sense, & good principles,- in the Memoirs, she seems
bespeak good sense, & good principles, - in the Memoirs, she seems
to [underline]labour[/underline] to give consequence to trifles, & by that means diverts
them of their only charm - Simplicity; the language too, in my
humble opinion, is studied & pedantic - Walter Scott I do not know,
but I have a Friend who says he is as pleasing in Conversation
as he is in his Poems - I very much admired Mrs. Placid; the
Author I hear is a Lady, I suspect I know her, but as I am
not certain I dare not name her - I have read [unclear]Corinne[/unclear], but
independent of the description of places, & Customs, (which I fancy
are admirably correct) I greatly disliked it- [unclear]Variety[/unclear], was the
Idol which Corinne worshipp'd, even to her death-bed so[unclear][/unclear]
I abhor Made. de Stael, & perceive the Cloven Foot in all [unclear][/unclear]
writes - You will think my good Friend that I give my poor
opinion in a very dictatorial style,- but remember you ask'd
for it, & therefore you have it very honestly - I rejoice at your
recover, & at the pleasing account you give of your Children -
Elizabeth & Deborah will not be the less useful in Domestic concerns,
for having Genius,- it is only [underline]Smotherers [/underline]who are injured
by it, & I should expect [underline]your[/underline] Children wod. be well grounded in all
they profess'd to know; one of our most learned Englishwomen,(Mrs.
Elizth. Carter) on being pitied by some Friends for being confined with
her Fa[unclear][/unclear]., replied "the true post of honor consists in the discharge of those
duties, whatever they happen to be, which arise from that situation in

which Providence has fix'd us, & which we may be assured is the very
situation best calculated for virtue, & our happiness", thus, I am persuaded
your Children will think - I always suspected my favorite Richard
wod. be a clever Boy! I find I have more queries to ansr.- Mrs. Allan is
well & happy - She is soon expecting to add to her family. [unclear]Jn[/unclear]: has been
particularly well this Winter, till within the last week, She is just now
very indifft. - We have excellent accts. of the little Sailor - the [unclear]Admiral[/unclear]
says he is extremely improved in all Respects, & particularly well - disposed.-
My eldest Son & Louise have again disagreed, & separated, the
one little Girl,- we have had little-or rather [underline]no[/underline] intercourse wth. them [unclear]f[/unclear]
8yrs.-, till very lately, when I in vain endeavor'd to reconcile them -
