Lisburn June 22nd 1812
My dear friend
I did not receive thy letter dated the
30th of April until the beginning of June; I should
have replied [insertion]to[/insertion] it, & to the letter I received since
but sometimes I cannot find time to write, at
least my head is so perplexed in arranging
household affairs, magazine business, our little
school & various other matters, that I think
I cannot get leisure to write, and as I have
naturally a procrastinating disposition I am
frequently willing to make excuses to myself
for my indolence. The tale of
Seraph was written by Mrs Lamont, she
told me she intended to have written a
series of tales on the passions but she found
she could not attend to her school if she continued
to write; so after writing Seraph, to
shield the bad effects of Vanity, she was
obliged to lay down her pen. What a pity
that Genius & riches are not inseparable
companions - I hope thee will send the Tale
to the Magazine Proprietors. - They have received
the Walk to Langdale Pikes, but [insertion]it[/insertion] is
from Belfast & after staying a day went to Langan. We
told us they did not consider that they were paying us their
[insertion]promised[/insertion] visit, but they wished to go to Belfast & Langan &
then they would come to us and pay their visit. About
an hour after they went away Dr & Wm Drennan came
to finish my letter when Mary Greer and one of her little
daughters arrived . I mention all this to shew that I
in which I have written this letter will plead my
dear love to Betsy Shackleton, Eliz & Deborah &c &c &c &c
I really would not send this scrawl if I thought I would
writing so long that I think it best to send this altho'
were very much dissatisfied with their hasty visit, but they
to spend the day with us, & yesterday I was just preparing
am not so negligent as I may appear & I hope the hurry
excuse for the many blots & mistakes. Please give my
& believe me thy sincerely affectionate S Hancock
soon have time to write another letter, but I have delayed
it is shamefully incorrect & blotted.

too late for this month's magazine. They requested
me to inquire if the following
pieces of poetry are original. "The Funeral
Flowers" "Lines presented by a husband to
his wife on the anniversary of their marriage,"
"Cardinal Wolsey's lamentation on
entering Leicester Abbey after his disgrace"
"Song to Clarissa", "The Debtor" "Bertrand &
Matilda", & "Lines sent [deletion]by[/deletion] [insertion]to[/insertion] a gentleman by a
lady who had drawn him for her Valentine".
I believe all these poems will be inserted in
the Magazine, but the Proprietors wish
to keep the [underline]original[/underline] & the [underline]selected[/underline] poetry
separate, as it seems [insertion]so[/insertion] [deletion]to[/deletion] awkward to put
a piece of poetry which has already appeared
in print, under the title of [underline]original[/underline]
The Magazine will continue to the end of
this year. I should be sorry it would be dicontinued.
Samuel & Mary Haughton arrived here
on 6th day last; they are now in Belfast, but
I hope they will return to us [insertion]today[/insertion] with Jane &
Edmund. We are highly pleased with their
company. Tom Haughton of Langan is endeavouring
to get another wife; I think his first

wife might have put him out of conceit
with matrimony; age does not always
bring wisdom, & Tom makes himself ridiculous
by the violence of his love fit.
I was greatly disappointed at Betsy
Shackleton's determination not to come to the
North this summer; tell her I will write
her a long letter on the subject. I had many
plans in my head, but Betsy Shackleton's
not coming to the North has deranged them
all. Tell her she is very cruel hearted to
[unclear]refuse[/unclear] to come -
I have got a very pretty little [unclear]piece[/unclear]
of poetry from Dr. Drennan, on the death of
his son Tommy, an uncommonly fine boy-
Tommy died in winter, & during his illness a
rose tree in the library was in full bloom.
The roses withered very soon, & poor Tommy
died & the Dr. made a beautiful poem on
the subject; he says he distrusts poetic grief
but he could not avoid letting me see the
poem; "it is", says he, "intended only for the eye
of a dear friend, & not for the public eye; [underline]that[/underline]
is to profane such things, sacred & secret as
grief should be." We were highly delighted with
a visit we lately paid to the Dr.; he is gone to
reside in the country; he has a beautiful little

cabin which commands a fine view of the
surrounding country. But I should beg
pardon for writing so much to thee about
a stranger; I rank Dr. & Mrs Drennan among
my most valuable friends, & I frequently
make mistakes by supposing that what
interests me must interest them.
I thank thee for the receipts for the soap, but
as the apprehension of a scarcity are not
realized, we found there was no occasion to
have soap made.
June 25th I wrote so far three days ago, & from
a continual succession of company my time was
so fully occupied that I could not get time to write
a line. Saml, Mary, Jane, & Edmund Haughton returned
