them to temptations & difficulties they might have been exempt from, had mine been a more prudent choice. And now, dear cousin, I have in some degree informed thee how things have been & are with me, tho I am pretty much a stranger to the particulars of thy situation. I heard some time ago with concern that thou enjoyed but poor health, & was under a great depression of spirits, a state I have been little tried with, tho many who were never so faulty as I have been, (many good worthy people) have known it. I believe it is a painful trying time, & tho providence is all-sufficient, yet the company & reward of good Friends may be greater service, & a means of providing the Balm of comfort & consolation into an afflicted, humbled heart; tis far from my design to give thee any offence, or take upon me to advise, knowing myself a very improper person to do it, & I hope I dont value my self upon my own reconciliation with Friends: I am sure every time I think of it, tho its a comfort to me, it rather helps to humble than to excuse me in my own opinion: shall be very glad of a line or two from thee when its convenient, & I should be pleased if thou would write to me with the same freedom & confidence I have used to thee, & should be rejoiced to hear thou wert perfectly reconciled & reunited to thy friends & parents & that thy worthy Father & mother might yet live to have comfort in thee, & thou in them: my good wishes attend thy husband & children, from 
thy affectionate kinswoman, Elizabeth Dale
