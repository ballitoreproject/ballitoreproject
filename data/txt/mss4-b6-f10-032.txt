Carlow 25 Sept 1807
My dear friend
Thine of 11th is recd. the bearer
takes the lamb wool 3 3/4th a 18 - 5.7 1/2
I pd for this weight but double will it [unclear]now[/unclear]
stand weight as they generally deliver it
damp - sheep skin wool is not yet sufficiently
grown for manufacturing & I
know not when a small quantity of
these coud be had -
Our esteemed Doctr. was so imprudent
as to venture out too soon & also to take
improper food for his strength - wch threw
him back again - he is now recruting
again & more subject to Harriets directions,
physician hail thyself is a good
proverb - yet some of these wise heads are
more abstinate than other people -
Sam: Higginson continues dangerously
ill - also a son of Robt. Crostwaits our
family & next door as usual - we have
got Janet & Edmund to spend some time

Edmund looks thin but on the whole I
hope he may be spared to his amiable
mother he is a lively sensible child &
fond of his book the amiable qualities
of his dear father seem to have descended
upon him
I find our frds. Jams. & Mary have
been operating secretly (at least from us)
the first intelligence I had was from my
wife when in Dublin - what has he been
dreaming about these 7 yrs & his reticence
but a few doors off - I do not understand
this kind of Platonic love - however if
we mean to pass quietly thro' the world
we must take people as we find them
they have all our good wishes
Thou art too fond of paying me compliments
wch I do not deserve - Therefore
shall conclude wthout paying thee any
Thy affte. friend
Saml. Haughton
