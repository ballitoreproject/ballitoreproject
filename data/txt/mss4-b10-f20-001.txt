Fassaro 25th of 7th mo 1841
My dear Mother
We are all quite well I heard Erasmus cough
only once since thou left us. I made the cough water but he
did not take much of it. Late on 7th day evening my Father
came out bringing us news of your departure and a fine account
of the two parties he had been at. It was almost a pity John
should miss them I hope he may go in the evening to the
I forget where to which my Father brought him an invitation.
Yesterday we went to uncle Richard's to tea
Willy staid to keep house for Mr. Stilt & Charley - it was
hardly fair for me to go but they would not have it otherwise.
It was very pleasant to meet Grandmama
there and the rest of those whom we had not seen since
our return - Aunt Eliza & uncle Thomas, uncle Arthur
dined with us and came over on our car, & uncle Manliffe
walked over in the evening. Grandmama is
on a visit with Aunt Elizabeth, Reggy is there also and
Aunt Fayle is in Dublin, I forgot to ask who with.
We ought to have her out here for a while. They
were all very well & pleasant, complimenting me
on my good looks, &c. We have had no visitors
since except Clara Gillington whom I found out in
Enniskerry. She was nurstending her aunt Sophia
Haffield, who is very delicate & has 4 little children

Her aunt was very glad Clara found any acquaintances
out here to afford her a little variety for she was always fretting
at the thought of having her in such a dull place as she
called it. We took a walk over to Crinken where another
aunt was very ill whom Clara wished to see. Her
complaint was inflamation of the bowels - & when Clara
arrived she was [insertion]nearly[/insertion] insensible & expected to depart every
moment, this sudden catastrophe shocked poor Clara
greatly - It appears this aunt had fallen out with all
her sisters & any intercourse between them had ceased
for some time, these melancholy circumstances only
added to the poignancy of her grief. The walk
did not tire me in the least although we returned home very
fast. Other company we had now. Grandmama
says if the weather be fine & she can get a horse she
will try to come over and see us, and my Father
has invited uncle Thomas & aunt Eliza for 6th day,
it seems an odd thing to have company & the mistress
away - we shall be badly off without thee it will not
be easy for me to make preparations &c & entertain
the guests at the same time. Two men were
here asking questions about Strong's Cottage, they said
they'd call again to see my Father but as they have
not been here since I suppose it will come to
nothing. The weather has been pretty fine
this day is very damp the flags are quite wet
which prognosticates wet

There has not been a letter from Mr Gough these 6 weeks.
aunt L. had no news but this. The calf has quite
recovered himself. Sally got me the [unclear]1/2[/unclear] stone of flour for
1..4 which is very nice, the next time she goes I shall
send for salt, she could not carry both easily.
No news of uncle Manliffe's hat case - I had a nother
letter from E. Christy - uncle James was reading [insertion]the[/insertion] Waverly
[insertion]novels[/insertion] for them & Scots descriptions of the scenes we past thro'.
How pleasant! with all the places so fresh in the
memory, to have them fixed their more permanently
by the magic pen of Scott. I hope you got down
without any disagreeable adventures and that all
friends were well pray give my love where [unclear]due[/unclear]
I have not time to enumerate the[deletion]ir[/deletion] names, of
those to whom I wish to be remembered. Selina
joins me in love to Polly & thyself. We had a piece
of beef not the round yesterday with 3 ducks & one of
the pies which was pretty good. to day we have
a leg of mutton. Thine affec

P.S. Perhaps thou could find out something
about Mary 'annes' people, or nurse's children it
wd give them such pleasure to hear from such good
authority.

the [unclear]hood[/unclear] is for
Jenny Thos. who
ask'd for a pattern
of mine
