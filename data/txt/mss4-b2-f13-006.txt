Dear Cousin/		Skipton 9 month 16th. 1766
R. Shackleton/

I had written to thee before the yearly Meeting, expecting an Opportunity by William Birkbeck to London, but he hurryd thro & did not call upon me, & since I have put off writing from one time to another  My Husband is abroad, [word crossed out] myself & children (thro Mercy) all well - my youngest child, a girl, ^now^ about. 6 months old, was seizd in the month [sic] with the Thrush & Convulsions which reduced so very low that we had no expectation of her recovery, but to the great surprise of all who then saw her, she at last got the better of it, & is now a fine sprightly healthy Child without any apparent Remains of her Illness  My Brother left Settle some time ago, he had lost his school there, & came to Skipton, but being quite out of Bread & nothing to bring his Wife, she refusd to see him & went out of Town whilst he stayd here, purposely to avoid him; he went to Bradford where he found kind Friends. John Hustler was remarkably kind to him, he got him a very good school at Idle in that neighbourhood, & I have the pleasure to hear the people in & about that Village are so well pleasd with him that they propose settling something of a yearly Income upon him if he continues steady & diligent, he has known some hardships, & perhaps may now settle himself 
	My Sister is still at Settle with Morris Birkbeck, she has been very poorly, her Indisposition, I believe, occasiond by indulging too much a fruitless & unavailing Concern for her poor Brother - she is a kind tender hearted Creature & has felt too much for him, ony Brothers Wife is with ^lives near^ her Father & ^as^ they pretend is supported by him  I shoud be very glad to hear soon how you all are, tho I write so seldom, I cant forget my dear Friends who have condescended to favour me with a Correspondence & Notice which I highly value, & am I hope sensibly grateful for, being conscious tis more than I merit
Shoud I live to see my Children well up & ever once in a likely situation to indulge myself with a journey of pleasure, I think I coud gladly go many Miles to see you all, especially, if there was no Water betwixt us; but as things are Im easy & pretty well Content under a state of close Confinement, for I am often many Months & dont sit a quarter of an Hour in any House but our own, nor very rarely or ever go a Mile out of Town, having never left my Family one Night since I had one. Excuse me (dear Cousin) for entertaining thee with such trifling relations Im too apt to speak and write what comes first in my Way tho perhaps often better omitted
I am with very dear Love to thyself spouse & Children thy sincerely affectionate & obliged kinswoman
Elizabeth Dale

P.S. Please to present my kind Love to thy worthy Father, Mother & Aunt Bernard & also to thy Sisters little son who I hope is still under your Care
