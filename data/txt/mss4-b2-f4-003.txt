Dear Cousin/

	I purposely delaid [sic] fulfilling thy Commission till this time expecting opportunities of conveyance would present; thy Nephew John Grubb has in charge for thee a Port-folio of black leather, something like John Eliots, with additional conveniencies for Pens, Ink, &c. two locks & a Key; suited as well for carrying abroad (to a Province Meeting, or the like, where such things may happen to be wanting) as for home use; consulting our Friend J. E. about the nameless utensil, so well described, he produced two very neat small Presses, of little service to him, as he said, desiring me to send them for thy acceptance, with his & his Wifes dear Love to thee & thine; they seem likely to answer thy purpose, ^but^ if not quite heavy enough, or too small they may serve for patterns; many Friends enquire after you, but so many of your Nation have favoured us with their Company at this our annual assembly, to mention their Names is unnecessary, or to say much of the Meeting, are not the Epistles sufficient? this much however may be no infringement on them or the Bearers, that our Meeting was nearly as usual, as to number, though some Counties were unrepresented, Devon & Dorset I think, Cornwall particularly, Catherines husband did not attend, nor Catherines self; I fear they are not well; her companion Lydia was up, she manifestly improves with her Talent -- of Women there were few, yet (if the Expression be allowed) it was a Maiden Session, neither Appeal nor Proposition appearing, nor material Debate; one Expression indeed of a liberal minded Friend, whilst the Sufferings of our Brethren in America were under Consideration ^to the Honor of General Washington be it spok^, gave umbrage to some who have different views, honouring the Powers that be here as the only ordained; by the accounts that appeared from thence, Friends generally were preserved in a steady consistent Conduct, the principal sufferings seemed to be in New York Government & New Jersey, & in the latter chiefly, the then Seat of War; particularly from the Hessian Mercenaries, who, not contented with Plunder only, have behaved with shocking Brutality to the Inhabitants, to the Women -- but it is too shocking to relate -- even Children could not escape -- by way of Palliation it is said the Congress too is arbitrary & oppressive; to the Honour of General Washington be it spoken, this Army was kept under due restraint, paying for what they had & abusing nobody -- in New England Things were pretty quiet & Friends under no particular suffering -- may the Judgment be mixed with Mercy, for it certainly will overtake the doers of these Evil deeds, -- happy for Man that Blood-thirsty Man sitteth not Supreme --
	I am pleased that Cousin Abraham intends to favor me with an Answer to mine, I should have been glad of it sooner respecting Thomas Hardings affair, who has not been civil enough to send a Line or any Message that I find in reply to one I sent him with his Goods [?] back again, which he perhaps deemed uncivil, but I could not with propriety do otherwise; what I fear is that Joseph Pim is kept out of his Money between us, if he have complied with T. H.s enormous demand -- but Abraham I ought to excuse, for if as to Matrimony thou hadst seen no Sign of it -- near a Month ago, Fame now says otherwise, & I, credulous, am willing to believe you both. I hear a certain woman named Lydia, a Seller of Purple ^which worshippeth God^ hath captivated his Heart; may hers also be opened unto ^that she attend unto^ the Things which are spoken [word crossed out] of Abraham  -- she too being a damsel fair & ruddy [?], & of good report; -- if it afford any additional satisfaction, they have my consent & entire approbation, not doubting but thine ^(yours)^ was first had. when it suits please to inform Hannah Wilson that I received her favour & have sent into Gloucestershire for a Cheese-vat, but not yet got one, so could not take the Money of she sent, not knowing the exact Price it will come at, nor would I have her ranked with the bad Pay-masters, by paying beforehand, when she receives it will be time enough -- my ^Our^ love is to her whole -- & to our Friend [sic] in general, the Particulars my spouse is to undertake, who talks of writing to some of Cousins, -- in near affection to thee Cousin Elizabeth & the Children, all of whom I hold in grateful remembrance, to their Aunts & Cousin Samuel, I remain thy assured & obliged Friend
	& Kinsman

P. S. I congratulate & rejoice with you on Cousin Peggys account. Cousin W. Fairbanks Daughter continues, & we think better, her Father think he sees it, they are much obliged by your kind notice -- Cousin W. Foster is well as ever, neither dear nor married he joins the Family in Love to you & I trust will endeavour to maintain the Character he has obtained Commendations encourage Youth. The Example also ^of those we esteem^ is very prevalent -- I wish he may not only have the Fathers in view only, but find seek his Lydia too. the Poker case cost 16/ -- were not this addressed to an able scholar, a fair copy or explainations [sic] might be necessary
