My dearest Aunt
We left London
yesterday at 8-20 AM a
day sooner than we
intended & we arrived
here at 6.20 PM last
evening or rather at the
Terminus, & down here at
7. or a little after
If I had come under other
circumstances I would
have been [underline]delighted[/underline] to
see my old favourite
even as it is [underline]I am glad[/underline]
though there is sorrow
over my heart - & many
a sigh I give in the
midst of it all when I
think there is the face

I will not see on my return
& to know it is [underline]Albert[/underline] that
is [underline]with[/underline] me & not [underline]you &[/underline]
[underline]Uncle Thomas[/underline], The whole
thing is like a dream but
alas! as Florence says it
is a dream we will not
wake out of, the [underline]reality[/underline]
staring us in the face
after we refreshed ourselves
last night with a hearty meal
Albert & I walked up one
side & down the other
of the Tuilleries Champs
ÃŠlysees as far as Arc de
L'Etoile - and to day
we went round the
Palais Royal, through the
Louvre, up the Pantheon
to the [underline]top[/underline], to the Gardens
of the Luxembourg, dined
on Soup. roast beef, salad
confiture 1/2 Bottle [unclear]some[/unclear] each
for 9d- a better dinner than
we got in London in [deletion][/deletion]
Boulevard St [unclear]Murice[/unclear] then
walked to the Jardin des
Plants & saw Jussieu's Cedre
de Lebanon then all through
the menagerie the animals
are not to compare to
those of London - then
to Notre Dame [insertion]& Palais de Justice[/insertion] all along
the Quay [unclear]through[/unclear] the
Tuilleries up Place Vendome
intending to take our
"coffee" on the Boulevard
when we saw heavy rain
approaching so we returned
here [underline]tired[/underline] you may be
sure & it is very well we
did come back for the
rain was tremendous so
while resting I thought I
would to you &[unclear]M[/unclear]
& post them in the
morning [unclear]did[/unclear] we do [unclear]a[/unclear]
had days work we were

on foot from 9-30 [insertion]AM[/insertion] till

On Tuesday last we
met Uncle A in the
Royal Academy & after
viewing the pictures there
& in the National Gallery
we three went to Sydenham
by the High level Railway
& returned in the evening
by the Low level ditto -
We dined in the Palace
Uncle A treating us to wines

with the ground & also
got into Sir Joseph Paxtons
place. next day we went
