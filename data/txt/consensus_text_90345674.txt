Shackleton. but the day turned out so

but little -.

10 Wednesday - Charlie came out by
the 4 1/2 train and Lyd and I rode
down to meet him, Mick bringing
down his horse - It was very pleasant
we cantered and ambled along the
strand rode into the sea splashing
and floundering - escaped nearly all
the flying showers and were home
just in time for tea - Going down to the river
with Charlie and music formed the rest of
the evenings entertainment.
4 Thursday - Papa and 'Mama' sailed
11 Thursday - Papa and 'Mama' sailed
this morning - I hope they may have a
pleasant trip wherever they go.
I rode down with Charlie and [deletion][/deletion]as
he has left his horse out - we hope to have
a few more equestrian expeditions, rather an
Irish manner of expressing myself -
