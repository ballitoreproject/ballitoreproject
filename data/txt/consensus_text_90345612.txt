29th.. Saturday. We took a long
walk this morning and a new
one too - On our way we passed
the ice fields and as there had been
a hard frost, they were very busily
employed loading the carts -
It was quite an enlivening scene
the loud voices of the men, the noise
of the carts and the cracking and
crunching of the ice all combined
made a great bustle in the hitherto
lonely and deserted looking field.
Oh the morning was a lovely one
so clear and bright, and the mountains
off in the distance, raising their
snowy and rugged tops just above
the horizon looked so picturesque.
I think[deletion]ed[/deletion] we walked five miles for
we were out 2 hours and walked
briskly all the time.
On our return we met Miss Hannay
and one [unclear]of[/unclear] the children - and afterwards
Mr Ball escorting the two Miss Deasys
and Miss Tivy -.
