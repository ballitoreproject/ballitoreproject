The joys of her dear home resign'd,
Its pleasant scenes all left behind,
She takes her way - & many a friend
Will on her parting steps attend,
And bear her babes, who sob & sigh,
And weep, tho' scarcely conscious why.
[deletion]But now, the painful parting done,[/deletion]
[deletion]She & her infants journey on;[/deletion]
[deletion]Toilsome[/deletion] A toilsome road [deletion]their[/deletion] [insertion]her[/insertion] steps pursue
Till the dark prison strikes the view.
How hopeless & how drear the sight! —
Oh Patience, do not take thy flight,
Support her soul, & calm her wo,
Whose tears in briny torrents flow.
And now the pondrous door unfolds
The wife her captive spouse beholds,
Pale is his cheek, & on his brow
Remorse has added weight to wo.
His ardent children round him press —
He trembles at their fond caress,
"And thou & these are lost by me,
Unworthy I of them, or thee!
Unworthy these kind looks to see.
Weep not, but speak — my longing ear
Would sympathy's soft accents hear."
Now Dolon might reflect, with pain,
How [deletion]oft[/deletion] she [insertion]had[/insertion] pleaded - while in vain
Her prudence & her forecast strove —
[deletion]Oh[/deletion] [insertion]How[/insertion] then can sympathy & love,
Howe'er the generous heart expand,
Disarm Misfortune's iron hand.
Which crushes sore! — beneath the sway
Even Hope's elastic springs give way.
[deletion]Oh[/deletion] [insertion]Yet[/insertion] know ye not, that One is nigh,
Who listens to the mourner's cry
Who will the drooping soul sustain,
When deep repentance clears the stain! —
Seek Him — He ne'er was sought in vain.
[deletion]And[/deletion] [insertion]Even[/insertion] while you pour the bitter tear,
Behold His delegate appear!
Behold a form of noblest grace,
Behold Heaven beaming in that face.
High-born — with Fortune's favours crown'd,
Her gifts to him were blessings found;
Valued but for the power they gave
To aid, to comfort & to save.
Led on by an unerring guide,
His temperate wants were soon supplied,
Simplicity his table spread,
More pleased the hungry should be fed:
Water he drinks, dispensing wine
Where pain & want together pine
And humble his attire besure
For much he loves to clothe the poor.
Fitted through earthly halls to move,
Or tread the Academick grove,
For nobler objects those resign'd,
His generous, his devoted mind.
Glows with the love of humankind:
To the lone hut, the infectious bed
His frequent step compassion led;
The prison's dreary bounds confest
The visits of the illustrious guest,
And where he turns his beaming eyes
Hope's cheerful dawn begins to rise
Even Dolon saw the ray benign
Upon his gloomy prospect shine
[deletion]while with his wife babes he sate[/deletion]
[deletion][/deletion]
This frd of man his state [unclear][/unclear]
[deletion][/deletion]
Twas but to see & purpose aid

Strict in enquiry soon he knew
Dolon's distress & follies too;
Wise as [deletion][/deletion] beneficent, his thought,
The surest means of succour sought:
First to redeem from knavish hands,
The injured Dolon's forfeit lands,
Was the kind act — employment then,
Thus sever'd from the walks of men,
His lot could soften, & could cheer
And brought the hour of freedom near.
Nor were the wife & babes forgot,
Their patron changed their former lot;
And well the industrious, frugal dame
Her house & humble shop became
Now eighteen months had roll'd away,
And Dolon still in bondage lay,
Still his protecting friend was near,
Prompt to instruct, & prone to cheer.
[deletion]His heart[/deletion] [insertion]The soul [/insertion]affliction [deletion]had[/deletion] [insertion]now[/insertion] subdued,
It bore the [deletion][/deletion] fruit of gratitude.
Whose eye his life with pity traces
Interested not in such a waste
Temperance & Independance came,
The renovated man to claim
Then follow'd joyous liberty
And now from all his bondage free
[deletion]Will[/deletion]
Has [deletion]Betram[/deletion] [insertion]Dolon[/insertion] past the prison gate
With bosom humble though elate
And he, the delegate of Heaven,
To whom this blessed task was given,
[deletion]He[/deletion] Feels [insertion]that which[/insertion] [deletion]what[/deletion] all his care repays,
And to his Maker gives the praise
Thus my true story have I told—
But why to thee this tale unfold,
Th[deletion]ou[/deletion][insertion]ee[/insertion] to whose comprehensive view
Nothing I offer could be new
Unthrift & suffering oft are found,
Even on fair England's favour'd ground,
And [deletion]veterans[/deletion] [insertion]heroes[/insertion] there of noblest name,
In virtues field [deletion]who[/deletion] win [deletion]their[/deletion] [insertion]fairest[/insertion] fame;
Yet warm'd with patriot feelings I must own
My wish, our heroes should to thee be known.
Ah while I write one Hero breathes no more,
Alas "his bright & brief career is o'er"
It was not he who Dolon's sorrows view'd
[deletion]But[/deletion] [insertion]Tho'[/insertion] with like graces & like gifts endued,
Whose spotless bosom every virtue warm'd
Whose life instructed & whose converse charmd,
At whose loved name our sorrows stream anew
Oh ever dear, lamented Lefanu.
