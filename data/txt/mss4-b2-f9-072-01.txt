Ballitore: 23/11 month 1784

My dear Cousin Debby,

	I have been rather uneasy lest thou shouldst think hard of my not writing to thee on the occasion of thy late trials -- I think it was at Clonmel (whither I went to pay the last offices to the remains of my worthy kinsman John Grubb) that I first heard of poor Josephs indisposition. He was a singular young man, who carried up to manhood the innocence & simplicity of a child. Surely if that state be the condition which alone qualifies for admittance into the kingdom, we have the most well-grounded hope that his innocent spirit is at rest for ever -- he was indeed more fit for heaven than earth -- & yet Infinite Wisdom saw meet that he should arrive at maturity of age, & then be removed I doubt not to a better place & better society -- However he was, the dispensation of his removal was trying to thee -- it opened former wounds, & brought into the house of sorrow. But if the cause & the effect were ordered in Infinite Wisdom, it is enough for us so to believe -- then we may be assured that all has been ordered aright. In the same wisdom thy only surviving son has been since afflicted ^affected^ with illness -- it has proved consistent with the Divine Will that he is spared a little longer to thee. May the Lords tender mercies, as well as judgments, the extension of his sceptre, as well as the infliction of his rod operate the desirable end of your being all brought into that lowly, humble, resigned state which is acceptable to our great Creator. +++ Thy truly affectionate kinsman	Richard Shackleton
