	** If thou and dear Mary were at home, I think we should all be very comfortable together, now our Debby is returned. I do not speak at random when I thus speak. I know wherein true comfort consists, and I know what an uncertain world we live in. I trust our dear Mary will have learned also, by the things which she has suffered, what is the greatest good--the good part; and that she will be enabled to dedicate her all, to consecrate every faculty, and devote the whole body of her affections, to Him who has been bountiful and gracious to her. Her duty, respect, and love, reflected back from Him, to those who have a right to claim them here, will then come with sweetest influence and acceptance.
					R. S.
