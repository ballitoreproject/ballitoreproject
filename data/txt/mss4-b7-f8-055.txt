Waterford 26 April 1807
Dear Cousin
Having caught a townsman
on the wing for Dublin I have merely
time to say that I have got about
30 Subscribers & expect 20 more.
Among them is a Bookseller who
puts down his name for 6 on condition
of their being rated as customary with
the trade which he says is 5/9 each.
Yours
W Raynar
