Sir George's road I acted
the coachman's part. We
brought Anna & her nurse with
us - After dinner the three
of us started for the Dargle
Charlotte mounted on the donkey
in great state, as she cannot
walk on account of her ancle
But what was our disappointment
when, on reaching
the wooden bridge to find
the donkey would not cross
it -no- all we could
do- coaxing - beating - all
to no purpose, whether she
had some misgivings in
her own mind [deletion]of[/deletion] [insertion]about[/insertion] the safety
of the old bridge, (which indeed
she well might have) or
whether she was highly gifted
with that obstinate spirit
peculiar to her race, I cannot
tell, [deletion]most likely[/deletion]
