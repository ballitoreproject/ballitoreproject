24th Sunday - We all went to meeting,
I saw Sam Haughton's wife for first time,
she is 'fine big person - middle aged
and not handsome but pleasant looking
[deletion]25th M[unclear][/unclear][/deletion] Soon after we returned Uncle
Francis, Uncle Thomas Aunt Eliza and
Emily arrived and we took a pleasant
walk through the wood - The day was
[underline]very[/underline] foggy which marred the views considerably
looked very pretty. Uncle Francis and
Emily staid the night
25 Monday No sign of the fog clearing.
We walked to the domain but it did
not look its best on account of the fog,
Uncle F went home by the 6 train -
Emily staid on - and it is pleasant to have her
still in spite of that the wood
