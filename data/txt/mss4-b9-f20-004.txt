6th mo 1827
My dear E - It seems long since dropp'd a
line to thee tho I had a message from
the Doctor & Bess Harvey to thee their thanks
for thy kind attention in letting them know
how Betsy fared Bess wd have written herself
to thee but [deletion]but[/deletion] was very poorly with a cough
& could not well stoop, she is at present in
this neighbourhood with Eliza Pim whose
only son is in a very alarming state of
health threaten'd with water on the brain
Jane Nugent & M Newman call'd several
times to enquire for Betsy & wish'd that she
should know they felt anxious about her
the last account from the Downes's seems
encouraging & cheerful they are hoping on
for an increase of pupils - I hope you
are done with all illness now for a while & that
this delightful weather will soon recruit
Betsy, are they all well at the school? was it
to see H Boake that Dr Henry went?
I Call'd to see M Chambers the last day I was in
town & found her tolerably gay tho' still confined
to the sofa without much chance of a speedy
release from it who would say she was not

a philosopher, she was very uneasy about Betsy
& the Doctor wish'd he was near her that he
might do all he could for her, she told me
of a curious adventure that happen'd to Mary
Moffet, as she was going thro' Liffey street about
5 o'clock one evening a genteel looking young
woman dress'd in mourning accosted her &
implored her for help saying she fear'd she
was in labour, Mary gave her her arm &
brought her into a little shop where there
was a very good natured woman, they
sent a messenger to the Lying in Hospital &
presently a Doctor & nurse arrived they
shut the shop door brought a bed down
stairs & in a short time a fine boy was born
the mother child Doctor nurse & M Moffet
were all put into a coach an hour after
& sent home to crow street where the young
mother resides she said it was her first child
& that her husband was dead 7 weeks she requested
Moll wd go to see her again, but I believe she
did not go, this adventure was worthy of M
Chambers herself - I should have mention'd
Bess Brennan before now but I suppose

she did not get encouragement to think
of coming to me, whatever she might
do as child's maid, I do not think she
would be more than our Nancy as a
nursetender, thou might say that if I had
any one in that capacity I wd get an experienced
person, I am going into town for a while
that I may be near Susy Doyle I grew
cowardly as the time drew near & she
encouraged me to go to town, - I send
a towel of yours along with this
say when thou writes if thou knows of
any very decent servants wanting
places I must be on the look out
again after a while but am not uneasy
for the present thou could have it in
mind & keep it to thy self
ever thy SB
