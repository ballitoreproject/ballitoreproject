My dear James,


        Yesterday thine to Aby came to my hands, ^ in his absence I opened it^ he went 6th instant towards Edenderry, he is indeed a great Inamorato, a lover in every literal, figurative sense of the word - For my part I am pleased to see it. I am glad he is like to obtain the object of his choice and inclination, for so many trying occurrences come athwart us in the course of our journey through this life, that a strong portion of natural affection is highly proper and necessary to be witnessed. But I also humbly hope that this choice and this inclination have been raised and directed by the Author of all Good. This is the crown of the blessing, & without this crown it would be no blessing. +++
        I have been lately making an excursion in company with John [?] Gough, Joseph Inman & Joseph Williams to Moat, Mountmelick & Edenderry - had some satisfaction at times in the little tour, having been made to believe that there is a Seed-Royal yet preserved alive among a remnant of our youth, to which my heart was united in the bond of spiritual fellowship. Go on, my dear James, follow on to know the Lord more & more, keep on the ground of light and conviction, for that is holy ground: keep out of the sphere of reasoning and imagination, and only as a new-born babe, desire the sincere (pure) milk of the Word, to grow and ^thrive^ thereby. I salute thee with near & dear affection, and my friends there (thou knowest them)


Farewell


Richard Shackleton
