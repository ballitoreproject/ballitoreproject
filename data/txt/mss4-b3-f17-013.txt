My dear Cousin,
        Thy kind letter found me at Samuel Hoares, where we, with our new Sister & her Sister were assembled, & loving that communication which participates good tidings I felt an impulse to read the extract thou favoured me with, to them, the old man gave great attention ^to^ it, and made some remarks which convinced me he had himself experienced the benefit of silent waitingprobably by this time those dear pilgrims (as thou termst them) are amongst you - and do, I hope, reap the peaceful reward attendant on a faithful discharge of duty
        I am obliged by the interesting intelligence respecting thy dear daughter ^Mary^, I trust that her heart & hand are sought by a person worthy of so precious a gift - give my dear love to her & tell her that I do with sincerity & affection wish her wellher faithful friend my Sister Abigail, did not let the least hint escape ^her^ till after I received thy letter on my simply ^asking^ who was William Leadbeater? a rising blush betrayed that she had had previous information
        I spent near five weeks at Lambs Conduit Street My Mother & Sister Abigail have got very agreeable apartments there  my Mothers health is very much improved since thou & I saw her in the 5th monthI left my dear Brother John & his wife inhabitants of Bartholomew Close  they were not settled but they prospected to be so soon, I hope he has at last found a suitable helpmate she appears a woman of good sense & natural firmness united with very gentle mannersan union rarely foundher deportment to every branch of our family is truly amiable& though I must allow that there is diversity amongst us yet, she pleases all  her health appears very delicate which I am afraid will be a source of anxiety to my Brother  however, I know no man better calculated than ^he^ to render those kind offices which a delicate woman may require
        I was pleased with thy account of Nanny Maconnaughys[?] peaceful end, & of John Goughs recoveryreading his history is a part of our evenings employ at present  at this season of the year there is little to invite citizens to the country & we are consequently very much alone and we are more at liberty to pursue our own plans my dear Agatha & I devote some of the forepart of the day to our poor neighbours visiting them in their own habitations where we can best judge of their wantsthis is her chief delightthou wouldst be pleased to see the face of every little villager gladden at her approachon first day last she & I heard sixteen little Girls repeat by heart the Serious Meditation which my Cousin Robert Grubb has been kind enough to make known to us
        David & Rachel Barclay both desire me to assure thee of their affectionate regardRobert Barclary & nine of his Children have had an eruptive fever lately  it is but [obscured by seal] days that he has been pronounced out of danger
        My love attends thy valuable Wife & dear Children of whose welfare I am always rejoiced to hear, Agatha requests thy acceptance of her love, amongst the rest of my lessons I am pleased to find that she has caught an affectionate Respect for thy characterFarewell, my dear Cousin
