Dear Cous
Having an Oppy of giving thee
some acct. how I & my family are, more particularly
than if I desir'd my Frd from
your land to do it verbally, tho sit
down to do it whilst the coach is getting
ready, he having call'd me up for
purpose therefore to be as concise
as possible, may say thine & Cous
Richd last favr was rec'd by me, wch
afforded me a deal of satisfaction
to find I was not forgot by those
whose friendship & kind well
wishes are are one so desirable to
be acquainted wth- I deliver'd ye acs
of ye state of thy Bro family to R:
Hartley whch she was pleas'd to hear, she
has long been weakly, some nervous
complaint has attended her, sometime -
I was fortunate enough to have some
of the Company of your Country man Jas
Beale wch was very acceptable to him
having accompanied him to Castleford
& to my Relations in Carbutt at Campsall
where we lodg'd & the next morn
went to Ackworth. Jane Birkbeck & many
there, both there & at this place, desires
affectionately to be remembered to the

& your family. I may tell thee I had nearly
been likely to have surpris'd thee by
my being likely to have met, in Joshua,
ye great desire I long have had to see
you at your habitation, & ye Oppy of
haveing company wch wd have renderd it
more agreeable to me than coming alone
but on looking well at it, diff circumstances
operate agst. attempting such
a trip at this time - ye Season of ye
Year & my having such short time
to regulate some matters necessary
& being at this time in some public
Offices &c makes it seem best to defer it.
& which of us knows what another year
may bring forth - my Cous who is
my Housekeeper only ret home late last
[insertion]Night[/insertion] to me from ye Quarterly Meet.g where
she met me, she having been at Campsall
wth my eldest Daughter Sarah near
a Month- Sarah was fifteen Months
there, & is likely to stay all Winter -
my other Dear little [insertion]ones[/insertion] (whom I believe
thou wd be pleas'd to see likewise) are
all well wth myself & have been favord to
keep so, a long time back - I made some
enquiry respecting B Wilson, of a Frd frm
Whitby where he lives & with whom he
had workd, who gives a very indifferent

acct of him, alas what a pity, that he should
not get his eyes open. & to see how he stands
on be much pleas'd to hear a different ass
shd be much pleas'd to hear a different acc
of him - we were fav'd wth ye company of
Jas Thornton from America at our Quarterly
Meetg who is is a very deep minister & whose
Company was very acceptable, indeed how
cou'd it be otherwise, when such instruments
are commanded to hand to ye different state
of ye people, it often times proves as healing
Balsam for ye wounds of ye afflicted-who if
retain a proper sense thereof, will be
of use after many days - I see my Sist
Holborn & her family at Sheffd where
they now live her Husband was at
ye Quary. Meetg & gave an acct of their being
well - don't know whether I mention'd
before, my eldest Sisters death, wh'ch happn'd
ere we were acquainted wth her
illness, poor thing, I much fear she was
not enough made sensible on what ground
she stood - I see Jane Hartley at York
she enquir'd after your family & wishd to
be remember'd to you, her Husband is
likely to be Lord Mayor of York next year.
The acct thou gave me of your friends was
very pleasing to me, who could but be
pleas'd to see such devotedness in heart
to service ye Lord - I wish ye number was
increas'd - I shall be glad to have an acc
[insertion]how you are[/insertion] when convenient to thee & as I am not able to

write thy Bro, must defer it. wth
Dear Love to all your family I may
subscribe my self Thy Affectionate Cous
