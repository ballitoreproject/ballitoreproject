Tulketh Hall.
5th/11th 1848.
My dear Sister,
I received
thy letter this morning.
I can not make
out why thou wants
me to write my best,
my hands are so hot
that I dont think I can
write well now.
I understand thy rule
very well.

Two men were up
here to day shooting
young crows, they
killed twenty seven.
There are a great many
young crows in the
nests yet.
There is not much
news here.
I am in a hurry
Give my love to Polly
I remain thy
affectionate Brother
Charles Barrington.
P.S. Write soon.
Tell Polly to write.
