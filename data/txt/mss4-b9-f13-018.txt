Richmond [unclear][/unclear] of 12th month 1826
My dearest Sarah
Mary is [unclear][/unclear] year old this day & she does
not run alone yet! "Oh! degenerate daughter!" - I was very glad
to get thy letter, though I only offer thee half a sheet now instead.
Reuben Harvey tells me that Edwd is quite recovered from the
fever, but that his back is not well owing to a fall he got some
time ago - I never heard of this before - I mean of the fall. - do
tell me particularly how he is, I am anxious about you both;
& wish when the busy season is over you would really come
for a while to us - the change of air & scene & company
might serve Edwd materially - do my dear Edward think
seriously of it - need I tell thee that as an invalid I would join
all my endeavours to Sarah's to do thee good & enliven thee, though
I am in general so [underline]bould[/underline]. James went to Cork to give his vote
to Hutchinson, the Emancipation candidate. I expect him home
to day - he is not quite settled yet - but means to pursue the
linen business. - he did not get the Secretary-ship he was seeking
for, lost it by two voices - so much for our luck. he bears
this disappointment better than I do as he does everything.
Our uncle James is married to a Miss Brown - we [underline]hope[/underline] it
will add to his happiness. Many thanks for the beautiful caps
thou gives me too much. I could not get such pretty ones here
& even ugly ones are of an enormous price. Sally means to
leave the north soon after Christmas. I suppose Mary has left
you. How are the children? & what progress does Willie make
in his colloquial & pedestrian powers. - great words! Whenever I used
a good word correctly every one here wonders at me - it is a
high joke. I shall spend rather a stupid christmas - aunt Jane
& hers are to be our guests. I had hoped to have our Dick, &
yet I could not urge him having no fun in prospect for him
