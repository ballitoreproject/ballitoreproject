Geraldine [unclear][/unclear] 27th 1818
Madam,
It was not 'till last night (on
my return from Dublin) that I was [unclear][/unclear]
with your letter of the 19th inst.-
Allow me to assure you that I shall
have much satisfaction in forwarding as
far as in my power your wishes'.
If you would therefore be so good as
to direct the widow Woman you allude to
to attend on Monday, any influence I may have
shall be exerted in [unclear][/unclear] with respect
to Phebe Murphy, I am apprehensive of the
pretensions, such time having elapsed (2 years)
and a new fear as not being as flourishing
as we could wish, to meet the good [unclear]visitations[/unclear]
of Many.
Jun. Dear Madam,
respectfully your very obedt.
Sect. Thos. Fitzgerald
