47 Basinghall st. London 24. 7. 1824.
Dear Sarah,
It is rather late to obey the request which
I think thou made to me when I was leaving Dublin, that I
would let thee know how I got on in my new undertaking in London; -
particularly when this request came from one of my oldest friends, whose
particularly when this request came from one of my oldest friends where
society & correspondence I have always highly valued so far as I was
permitted to enjoy them, - & whom I have often felt to be a sincere sympathizer
in my joys & sorrows - What excuse then can I make? - Well then,
Ebenezer, Deborah & Betsy were here when I first came; & they could tell
thee all about me & thou hadst then trials of thy own to bear without
my burthening thee with mine; - & I had little to speak of but hopes
& fears, & anxieties & disappointments. - But now the scene is changed -
I can congratulate thee on having welcomed home thy dear sister Deborah
in better health than thou hadst for a long time seen her enjoying,
with Ebenezer, Betsy, & thy little English niece; - & I can claim thy
congratulations on the commencement of my labours by my having received
a pupil, - who is almost every thing I could wish for - A few
weeks previous to my [deletion]hearing of[/deletion] having this application formed [deletion]as[/deletion] [insertion]the most[/insertion] cheerless
in which she mentions with pleasure the day that she spent with you in Gt. Britain street.-
I was delighted that two such favourites of mine had met, & still more so at the agreeable
impressions which Mary received from her visit.-
I should be glad to hear from thee occasionally, & also from Edward, though I
have not much to say on any subject that would interest either of you. - My present
studies are directed chiefly to the ancient languages, mathematics, natural philosophy, ancient
history & chronology.- I am meditating a course of lectures on Political Economy for
a Literary Society to which I belong, & am collecting materials;- but it is doubtful whether
I shall ever carry my design into execution--
I have not heard from Ballitore this long time. - Canst thou tell me whether a frank
inclosing letters from me to Betsey Shackleton, thy mother & Theodore Juliet ever arrived. - I [deletion]in[/deletion]
sent it to [unclear]Ricd[/unclear] to frank & forward & have not seen him or heard of it since.-
You have, of course, read the "Memoirs of Captain Rock;" it is sterling stuff - I am
lending mine about as extensively as I can, as the more it is read by the English the better. -
Hoping to hear from thee soon I remain thy affecte. friend

gloomy, desponding & wretched time that I ever recollect to have passed.-
But now the consciousness of having made a [underline]beginning[/underline] has raised me
from despair into hope & given quite a new character to all my feelings. -
My little pupil is not quite nine years old, but, for his age, he is one of
the most interesting & intelligent boys I ever saw; - I attend him 3
times a week, two hours each time; his father has directed me to teach
him Latin, but [underline]every thing else[/underline] he has left entirely to my own discretion; -
I have therefore been studying his tastes & talents & endeavour to adapt
my instructions accordingly. - I gave him a little taste of Euclid but
think it prudent not to press him to much more of it at present; & he
is now getting on famously with English Grammar, Arithmetic, Latin, Natural
Philosophy & the use of the globes. - In about six months I
shall probably return to Euclid & also put him into Greek.- His father
& mother are as agreeable as possible, just showing [deletion]a[/deletion] so much interest
in their son's progress as to see that he goes on well, without in the least
interfering with my mode of instruction. I dined with them about a
fortnight ago & was quite delighted with them; - their name is Hardcastle,-
they live at Camberwell in the neighbourhood of London.
So much for my pupil who now constitutes almost my sole enjoyment.
My present state of prohibition from intercourse with my "chere amie" -

in rendered as tolerable as such a circumstance would admit by my free
correspondence with her brother, & frequently hearing of her & seeing her friends.-
Since I came I have seen her father, (who was as friendly to me as ever)
her brother Rickman, & her first cousin & most intimate friend Matilda
Rickman who has been very kind - she lately gave me a copy in Sarah's
own handwriting, of some very pretty lines which she wrote a short time
ago on Loch-leven castle, - the prison-house of the unfortunate queen Mary.
I don't know whether thou hast heard that Sarah, in conjunction with
her elder sister Marianne, propose establishing a boarding-school for
the daughters of Friends; they have not yet fixed upon a situation.-
I generally spend my first-days in the country, being so fortunate
as to have acquaintance in several of the country meetings, [insertion]to[/insertion] whose houses
I may go when so inclined. - Among them is John Pim who has
been exceedingly kind to me; - he is really a most affectionate man
at bottom, notwithstanding his eccentricities; - I should go oftener to
his house but for his wife & daughter, - whose stiffness & want of sociability
are very repulsive-
I had lately a long & very affectionate letter from Mary Dawson
