My dear Molly's lines should not have remained so
long unnoticed: Gratitude & Affection forbad it - But my time
was filled one way or another in such a manner that I could
not even thinking of writing. I seize this first interval for showing 
my inclination to preserve the only intercourse that perhaps may
be allowed us for years to come. My place of destination is as
yet unknown but probably I will not spend another month
in Ballitore & thou must not impute it to want of love
when I declare I do not wish to see thee here before I go
I do not desire to be in any place where I would be exposed
to much temptation as I hope all my improvements may
be in things truly laudable. I have a very good opinion
of Waterford & would prefer it as the most eligible place
in Ireland but my Uncle has written about me to London
& the accounts I hear of all the advantage that might
attend my going to that city make me greatly long to steer
my course that was. Tommy Chandler speaks very highly
of

of their cleverness in business there & the good provision of
their Clerks. To be fixed with Morris Birkbeck until I
could get some insight into Mercantile affairs is the present
summit of my wishes & with my Cousin Sally I would
not be quite a stranger -- Thou gives a very affecting
account of the melancholy end of Blakeney Watson, his loss
must cause a great damp to the mirth of the circle he
was wont to enliven. The day of Ben Haughton's Marriage
was not marked with any particular event to distinguish
it from other days of the year Peter Cambridge was
there & thou may guess he made good use of his talents
to increase the merriment. The day following Abby found
herself at her own house encircled by the festive throng.
Yesterday my Uncle, Aunt & Sally returned from Moate
Meeting & brought along with them Betty Gatchell
& her fine little daughter. To-morrow Josiah Johnson
takes a final leave of leave of Ballitore. I suppose
for his Brother acknowledges him of age & he longs
to

burst forth upon the world. Paul has conveyed himself
away upon the appearance of Welsh Welshman with a
bond. If thou follows the practice of night walking perhaps
thou may meet the invisible patroling the streets.
Jemmy Brett & Peggy Malone took a trip about a
week ago to Rathcool & now make their publick appearance
as husband & wife: they are successors to Pat &
his Peggy's chamber but it will be well for them if
[unclear][/unclear] hours pass over with half such serenity [unclear][/unclear]
Debby is I expect getting the better of her [unclear]indisposition [/unclear]
by slow degrees she does not think it probable she
will be perfectly restored to health until the warm
weather is pretty much abated The Doctor recommends
early rising & early riding to get exercise
without suffering by the excessive heat of the Sun
accordingly I was her Squire at Five sometimes &
sometimes at Six. We have now taken all the various
rides I did formerly with my dear Molly but these
times will return no more.
