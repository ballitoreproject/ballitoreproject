I dont wonder at it - However not
withstanding the gloomy evening
we spent it very pleasantly and
had dancing music and singing
after tea - Mr Carrol came to the
boys assistance and [deletion][/deletion] acted his
part as bachelor the 3rd.. Mr and
Mrs Haughton departed early, leaving
the three girls behind them as
had been previously arranged
4 Thursday - The day for the
Phul a Phuca excursion - No
sun this morning, but fortunately
no rain either, so altho' it really
did not promise remarkably well
We started at about 10 1/2 - the
phaeton and two cars - for Frederick
Haughton had brought one too -
Lizze√© Holland, Miss Churchill
Aggy and Thomas filled the phaeton
Mr Waughton Miss Bell - Miss Waughton
and Patrick on one car - Isabel,
Richard, and I on the last one -
Oh dear we [underline]had[/underline] a drive, and a very
pleasant one too which was rather
to be wondered at as the day turned
