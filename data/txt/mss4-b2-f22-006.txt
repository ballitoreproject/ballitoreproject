Clonmel, 10 month 12th 1786.

My dear Grandfather,

I now take up my Pen to write to thee, & may inform thee, that my Mother & Aunt Molly returned from Cork fourth Day Morning, & are pretty well. We had the Pleasure of seeing my Uncle Abram here, but were sorry that he made such a short stay; he was only a few Hours with us. ____ I believe I would write to thee sooner only it is very hard to send a Letter free. Please give all our dear Love to all our Relations & Friends, & believe me to be

thy dutiful grandson,

Abraham Grubb.
