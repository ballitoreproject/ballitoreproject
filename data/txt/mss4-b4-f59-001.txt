My Dear Grandmother,
being so long silent I can assure thee want of affection
was not the cause of it, but altho' I have many times
thought of thee, and purposed addressing thee with a few
lines, yet generally something or other prevented; for altho'
I hope I may say that I endeavour at times to be a good boy
yet I know my dear Grandmother will be best pleased with
the Truth, and for that reason must acknowledge, that
I am sometimes so fond of play, as to find it a hard task to
get a letter finished to one of my friends, for which reason
I hope thou wilt excuse my not writing sooner.
I am writing to my mother, by the present favourable
oportunity, and I hope to hear from you both by
my cousin Peggy, on [insertion]her [/insertion]return from Lanster, for which
I long very much, in order to have the pleasure of
hearing from you. I don't doubt but my little cousin Betsy
Brookfields 4mo 24th 1792
I hope thou wilt excuse me for
Rich Shackleton (Abm) to ES
Brookfield: 24/4mo: 1792

Leadbeater is a great favourite of thine and my
Grandfather; I am sure I should be very glad to see
her and indeed to see you all, but as it is for my health
that I am in the North, I am writing to stay this Summer,
and then I hope my Father will take me home.
I am my dear Grandmother thy loving and dutiful
Grandson.
Richard Shackleton Junr
