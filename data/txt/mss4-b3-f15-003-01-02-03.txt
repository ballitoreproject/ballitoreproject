Dear Friend

	Whom I truly love & esteem for the sake of the excellent work which is in & upon thee, & the noble dedication of thyself to this ever Blessed Cause, which thy fore-elders were above all other considerations concerned to support. In a degree of that union which endears to one another those who are measurably baptized into the same Spirit & wish well to the same cause, I dearly salute thee, & now, as at many other times pray God to keep strait thy own feet & strengthenest thy hands. For I am sensible that great is the opposition in divers to the establishment of good order & maintenance of actual right discipline among usand great is their envy & bitterness towards those who are engaged therein. They are exactly of the same stump with the revilers & scorners in Nehemiahs time, their dialect is the same medley of the Jewish & Ashdod language, & their speech is to the same purpose tending to vilify the work men & ridicule & disparage the work. What ^do^ would these feeble Jews? If a fox go over their wall it will fall down. But by their great opposition to the building they manifest that they are afraid it will stand. For if the work be so frail, they should rather pity the poor deluded workmen, suffer them to go on with their work & let time & experience demonstrate, whether the wall has been so weakly & injudiciously built that it will fall of itself. Or whether it will be an ornament & defence to the inhabitants within.	
[page number] 6	Read the book of Nehemiah, there is encouragement, counsel & information in it. Tis observable he had both tasks to do at the same time, to build the wall & oppose the attacks of the enemy; with one hand the labourers wrought in the work, & with the other held a weapon. Observe the constant watch he kept, observe how frequent he was in prayer.	
	So, those, dear friend, who are engaged in this work, who being in a good degree converted themselves, are minded to strengthen their brethren, those had need to begin at the right end of their work & first (as Nehemiah) make sure of their commission from the King, then take care that they have proper skill & materials for the work, that they carry it on in a proper temper of mind, & defend it with proper weapons. For a work may appear necessary to be done, but wisdom should direct as to the time, place & manner of carrying it on. And when we meet with opposite spirits that knowest that we ought (& I find it very difficult for myself) to beware that the bitterness & brittleness of their tempers do not sour & unsettle ours, & so that which was the cause of Religion become a personal pique. Let us speak no farther than we ourselves can see. If we enter the lists let us besure, we so long as we engage, that we have on the whole armour ^which is^ [word crossed out] light. Though Saul was the Lords anointed, & a King over his people, yet David could not bring down the ramping, vapouring strength of Goliath by going against him in Sauls armour. I own it is comely, proper and profitable, & a duty which we owe the Lords Anointed (his Ministers) when freedom of mind admit to shew our good-will to them & the cause they are engaged in, by attending them in the service of it. And such young soldiers may reciprocally be a strength & comfort to their leaders, & be like armour-bearers before thembut what I mean isthat such should be careful to mind their own business, & the particular part of the work set before them, & neither on the one hand be over zealous in espousing by argument any particular part of their leaders work (though probably right) which they themselves have not a clear sight of; for this may lead into unnecessary debates & disquietude; nor, on the other hand, omit performing what may appear their own duty, because a more able & experienced person is present, for this will occasion leanness & want.
	So, dear friend, in pure good-will, & not from any apprehension of thy wanting a measure of best wisdom to regulate thy conduct I have ventured to send thee this unpremeditated matter, asi t came up while in a fresh spring of brotherly love & sympathy I thought I found my mind enlarged to gree thee: & therein my dear wife & I tenderly salute thee & bid thee most affectionately Farewell. +++
	I am thy truly affectionate friend, who at times is enabled fervently to desire thy preservation & steady perseverance (as thou hast nobly begun) in every good word & work
	Richard Shackleton
