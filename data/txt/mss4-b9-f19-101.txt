My dear Elizth
I expect Edw will be the bearer of this
he goes to bring home Maggie I hope he will
find you all well & my fathers leg greatly amended -
Johnny's head is well I forgot to tell
thee so the last time I wrote - I believe there
are some of my clothes in Ballitore still & I would be
obliged to thee to send them to me when thou meets
with them there is a dimity bedgown if it be not at
Moone where I left my cap I say as much about my
as if I had but one & indeed I cannot say much
more as I burnt one of the 3 new ones I made
this summer - I also left some old buff calico
which seem'd no better than [insertion]a[/insertion] rag[deletion]s[/deletion] but it is the pattern
of Edw's frock coats & of course valuable to me -
do not perplex thyself looking for these things
but just if they should appear send them to me
I fear thou hast had trouble about the eggs - are
apples cheap with you if I could get Rosses from
the retreat garden I would like to have 2 hundred suppose
2/8 per hd sent by Edw
I am ashamed of all the trouble I give thee

I enclose our acct. I dont know whether I put down all I
recd from thee or not but thou will know - if thou
should get apples or eggs for me thou might get money
from Deborah to pay for them & I wd be obliged to
thee to pay R S L for 1/2 cwt of whole meal for
which I owe him I am really ashamed of all
these commissions - Betsy is at Rockville
to night I believe I expect her here on 3d day
to hear the news from Ballitore she has
found out - Harriet Lefanu H Dawson call'd
& paid a little viz here along with Lucy Allen D
Johnson gets on very well but is weakly still
her son Paul much better than he was some time ago
Jas Pim Jnr has a second daughter the eldest is not
as old as Johnny
but I believe
is able to run
about
thy SB
