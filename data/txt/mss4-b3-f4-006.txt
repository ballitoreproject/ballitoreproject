Scarbro 9th month 10th 1782

My dear & most valued Uncle
	An intention that has long accompanied my mind & frequently in the course of my late journey of finishing my last letter to thee is now strengthened by the perusal of thine to Mother & a little leisure upon my hands in this place affords me a comfortable opportunity of resuming an intercourse I greatly value & as I beleive [sic] the subjects before me when I abruptly left the scrawl thou hast got, were a new important connexion & an awful prospect of joining my beloved Friend M. Proud in a visit to Scotland Cumberland &c both which being now fully reallized [sic] I need not speculate upon them, nor reap up the manna of that days gathering to send thee, but content myself & my Friend with a simple relation of what has since transpired & of a part of the manifold marks of divine compassion to the weakness of the Instruments he is at times pleased to use, for were we not encouraged with a degree of hope that the hollow of his Hand is a Sanctuary to his dependant Children, we should fail in the day of trial & be ready to conclude that as apparrent [sic] prosperity does not attend it we will therefore speak no more in his name  how excellent a thing it is to have a sight of ourselves, to know our business & simply to do it! whereby we obtain that hope which maketh not ashamed, for what are we? poor & contemptible indeed, all that is of the creature is against ^us^ till subdued & sanctified, however specious it appears & secretly saps the groundwork of that Kingdom in the heart it is pretending to establish  seeing then that it is not by our might or our power but by the spirit of the Lord that his adversaries are subdued, the scattered restored & the true Israel encouraged to jorney [sic] forward, what more has any servant in the family to desire than that their work & their honour may proceed from God only, pressing after an closer ^increasing^ alliance to his spirit & strength firmly to stand in the appointed lot, being supported with a degree of that holy faith whereby the just do live
When an unavailing anxiety has possessed my mind about the situation of things amongst us & the wilderness state of the Church I have been led to conclude that it is not consistent with the divine will that we should be ever impatiently enquiring what wilt thou do for thy great name but rather center deep in our own minds ^that^ resignedly & faithfully we may cooperate his work in the Earth, feeling our wills so reduced as only to pray for that which is the mind of the spirit, 
even if it required the petition feed thy People with thy Rod  I sometimes think the present seems a day that calls for our getting a degree deeper than many of our late ^&^ valueable [sic] Predecessers [sic] have done, whose service being adapted to a degenerating People that forbore to enter within the vail of the Temple, has been as been as in the Tabernacle of the Congregation in measure sitting where the People sat  far be it from one to derogate from the ardent zeal & solid worth of a number who have signed & cryed for the abominations that prevail but if I may be allowed freely to express myself the time seems ^now^ come when even such with their successers [sic] in the Truth are loudly called upon to go down again to the Potters house, if peradventure in the repairing of the Temple any of the vessels may be refitted for a place therein.
	Thou mayst have heard of the failure of several of the foremost rank amongst us as also of some less esteemed, but judgment seems first to have begun at the house of God  We are greatly shaken in this Country & power is in the divine Hand to shake us still more, for when the quaking of our Earth will cease cannot yet be perceived, the fruit of darkness, the effect of an evil eye is the bread many have now to eat & all for want of an upright resolution to serve the Lord, for then he would have blessed their bread & their water.  but how I digress from my intention (when I look up my pen) of telling thee that about a week after we left home last 4th month we entered the borders of Scotland taking a few meetings in the line as we went & the first week in the 5th month attended the yearly meeting at Edinburgh which lasted two days in which were three public meetings for worship & one at the conclusion said to be for business wherein some queries are read, but not more than on reputable member of society constituting that meeting being there, out of whose hands the Ark if I may so call it is wrested, there could consequently be no regular business transacted  Our stay in that place is memorable for the unremitting distress of our minds the deep & painful sense that tho at times there was favor & openness extended to divers of the Towns People that attended our gatherings at that time, in discovering to ^them^ the principle of truth, yet that the stones of stumbling under our name are such that till they are dug up & the remembrance of them shall not, Zion, cannot break forth neither on the right hand nor on the left, but may in that place be truly said to be in bitterness  this called a meeting for business proved a releiving [sic] time to our minds particularly respecting the students to whom a renewed visitation was offered & sensibly felt by some of them, but Parents suffering their Children to pass through that fire to any Molech is a crying evil  from Edinburgh we proceeded directly north rode about 50 [?] miles before we found another meeting amongst Friends, yet feeling our minds drawn ^to the Inhabitants^ of some Towns we passed through we ventured in much fear & with a little faith to stop & make some efforts towards collecting the People which then & several times afterwards proved successful and satisfying  there are a simple sincere & seeking People in that Land who though they are not of our Fold we had to beleive [sic] are acquainted with the place of true feeding [sic] & the light of the gospel day is risen upon them  it rather appeared to us as if the feet of the messengers that are sent that way will more & more be turned to these People, but there are many requisites for such an undertaking which sometimes in prospect are not enough perceived  it seems highly needful that women especially should have with them ^a^ feeling baptized Elder, a man of Judgment & exertion who can perceive with [word crossed out] ^his^ Companions the right time & place for stopping & then make suitable way for whatever is in view not having business at home that requires his hastening to it, for this is a great wieght [sic] in the scale against the 
cross  We had a kind Companion but he is a minister, not an Elder, a man of business & it required his attention  we often availed ourselves of this excuse & I am apt to beleive [sic] (though if we had been left without excuse it would have been better) that the fault was more ours than his  theres something in us that does not like always to bear the yoke, but would desire now & then to have the reins in our own hands without feeling as ^we^ go went along for the resting of the Cloud upon the Tabernacle or for the smallest pointings of duty ^or^ knowing it to be our meat & our drink to do the will of our heavenly Father  for the prevalence of this disposition we had often to eat aasa it were the Passover with bitter herbs & with some good resolutions that if ever we go into that Land again a greater degree of faithfulness shall be sought for  As we got farther north we found more friends, some of whom seemed preserved in a degree of true simplicity though as in this land (& perhaps with you) much weakness attends even the foremost, and in general they are scattered people  great discouragement covered us at times in our visits to them fearing lest the pure principle of light of life should be totally extinguished & nothing [word crossed out] ^is^ able to remove these views but that fresh anointing whereby we are able to see the sufficiency of that power which out of the stones can raise up Children unto unto [sic] Abraham & whose word can proclaim let there be light & there is light  at Old Meldrum the furthest meeting in Scotland we found about 14 families all which we visitted [sic] & had cause to beleive [sic] ^that^ there are a few young People submitting to the operation of truth, of whom we had & have hope that they will be instrumental in restoring the unoccupied paths of our ancient Predecessers [sic] to the sincere Travellers in this day  We were in all about three weeks in Scotland & from there returned into Northumberland, next through Cumberland, Westmoreland, a few meetings in Lancashire, the County of Durham & so directly home  to make my observations on the general state of things amongst us to a Father in the Church appears unnecessary & is really so except that thereby my judgment may ^by^ discovering itself reap instruction from thy superior experience of it, but it often appeared to us in our travelling along as if the Shepherds were smitten, some happily removed from the evil to come, the tru mourners ^that remain^ hanging down their hands almost in dismay & ready to cast aside their shield, concluding the glory had departed from Israel & the Lord would no more be enquired off [sic] concerning them, whilst others who had assumed pre-eminence in the Church & preferred the name to live to the life itself, are blasted in their deed  the Pillars thus giving way, the building seemed to totter & the flock whose dependance was on man & who had not made the Lord their refuge, are in the day of trial scattered ^from^ the place of true feeding, some immersed in the spirit of the world & with others lifeless formality triumphs  the secret cry of my mind was often who is sufficient for these things, I am a Child take me by the hand & lead me, lest I turn to the right hand or the left  we felt at times deeply our weakness & when most baptized thereinto with our eye simple to divine help we had humbly to observe ^that^ then his strength was manifest in our weakness & that it was only as we descended to the spiritual brook & there received with simplicity the heavenly armor that the battle was blessed & our heads covered therein & that ability was found to distinguish the little ones on whom the purifying hand is turned: renewed experiences of this sort have ^I^ trust proved in some degree solidly instructive to our minds  My companion was often much favored in close searching labor as also in publishing the glad tidings of the Gospel to those of other denominations in which like a good servant bound to ^her^ Masters cause she is apt to rejoice & as often I think I may say she was stripped & ready to abhor herself for her whom we desire to serve [word 
crossed out] wisely places the vessels in his ^house^ (that are subservient to him) so that they cannot glory in themselves nor have any confidence in the flesh  I beleive [sic] I may say we returned under the humbling impression of being unprofitable servants begging to be enabled to continue at the gate of wisdom & to attend in future to the smallest of its pointings  We were out just twelve weeks & made twelve hundred & forty miles  I reached home a week before my Husband, & accidentally met with him upon a Common as I was accompanying Mother one stage on a little excursion to Bradford & Ackworth  I need not tell thee how agreeable it was to us. On our separation the passage feelingly occurred to, & refreshed my mind Lord I have left all to follow thee to be employed in the service of truth & to have the spirit thereof for my companion *when nature was subordinate) appeared far to surpass every selfish enjoyment in this life, notwithstanding I might prove a vessel of the least honour in the family & on our meeting again I found there was need of a renewed engraving of these impressions in order to preserve [word crossed out] ^a^ preference to the truth & keep up in our remembrance that we have no continuing City here
It was an awful thing to me to enter into this new sphere  I am now blessed with all & more than I had any right to ask for ^in^ it  I wish to number these blessings & approve myself worthy of them  this belief ever accompanies my mind that if we wrest not ourselves out of the divine hand that fatherly care & protection is over us that our cup of life will be so blended as to prevent our settling down in the outward enjoyment thereof  few & fleeting are the days of our days of our pilgrimage, & every additional experience confirms the sentiment that our solid satisfaction depends not on our possessing all that the unmortified part in us can desire, for there still remains a void in the immortal part which immortal substance only can satisfy, therefore to have this supplied with wholesome food & every other gratification to stand subordinate thereto is the present secret breathing of my spirit, that so the blessing of preservation may attend us that patience may have its perfect work till the burning of the Lords day hath done its office & a quiet ^center^ in everlasting repose is obtained  Perhaps in the course of a few months my Husband may give me a sight of his native Land if no unforeseen event intervenes, if its in the right line & Providence favors us to meet at Ballitore with the evidence of his approbation I beleive [sic] I shall rejoice to see thee & not less so that I can with some propriety address thee with an epithet which acknowledges an additional alliance to what we before knew & though it is inferior, it is I hope no unprofitable gratification when our minds are gratefully led to confess that every temporal as well as spiritual gift from the divine hand is good  as to our settling in Ireland we have con conclusive sentiment; to be led about by better wisdom than our own is our most fervent desire because did we determine for ourselves our affections & those of our friends might have a bad influence, for affection is not like truth which always speaks the same thing but *like fire & water) is a good servant & bad master, judgment & rectified reason should preside over it or it will assuredly involve us in a distress it has no power to redeem us from, therefore the sympathy & fellow feeling of our friends on both sides the water we rather crave than counsel which has received the bias of inclination; but I was pleased with thy hints to mother on the subject  I begun this letter at Scarbro ^where we spent 2 [?] weeks^ & am finishing it at Foston  we had Father & Mothers company a few days since they desired their dear love, Mother is highly pleased with thy letter but says as usual she shall never answer it [word crossed out] ^yet^ when utterance unlocks her treasure I doubt not but things new & old will be brought forth  I have wrote thee so rough, a scrawl ^letter^ am ashamed to 
send it, a return of thy most impartial sentiments will be greatly valued by me, for beleive [sic] me I love the instructions [continued margin p. 5] of my friends but particularly of those I esteem as I do my beloved & honoured Friend whose [words obscured by fold] my Husband joins in dear love to thee
[margin p. 1, different handwriting] Thou sees how [word crossed out] Robert who can say very little for himself is favoured with a help mate with the Gift of utterance tho our Gifts differ (if I have a Gift) I hope they proceed from one Spiritt
