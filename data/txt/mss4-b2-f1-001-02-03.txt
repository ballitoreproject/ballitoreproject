Ballitore: 1/7 month 1780 
My dear James, 
I would hardly have wrote to thee now I believe, but that my wife and Debby have almost drove me from their company to perform this office - however it came about, they are both, as indeed are all my children, thy fast friends. ++ When I parted with thee,* we rode to Ennisworthy, thence to Bunelody & dined. Proceeding towards Kilnock a thought struck me that probably the wedding-folk# were feasting about somewhere in the neighbourhood, & coming to the place where the road turned off to Ballydarton, John Watsons abode, I asked a man who was riding there whether Kilnock-family was at home: he told me they were at Ballydarton. I therefore let Debby go, as she chose, with her obliging foreman to Kilnock, & I galloped away (sometimes in the right road, sometimes in the wrong, as usual) towards Ballydarton, and popped upon them all together in the parlor there at tea time, without their knowing of my landing till they saw me among them. And indeed right glad they seemed. For it is a truth that those who love their friends will be loved by them. After tea Robert Watsons [Watson erased and written over with pencil] wife engaged me to go with her and the bride in his carriage to Kilnock, & that little space of travelling was like the crown of my journey - my mind was much opened in communication with Mary Watson, [name taped over/corrected with pencil] which I have several times found to be the case. The burden was - but repeating it is only like the echo to the voice - the burden was a recommendation to lose ourselves - this loss would be our great gain. We would be found again in the immensity of the Divine Love & Life. Thus communing we arrived at Kilmock, and spent the evening pleasantly there among social friends. We reached home next day before dinner. The sight of me was the first notice my dear wife had of my arrival. +++
