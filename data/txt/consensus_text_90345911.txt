[Incorrect line]
8 Saturday. Papa did not go
[Incorrect line] which was
to town which was a wonder as it
is now quite an exception to the
general rule. First snow shower to day.
9 Sunday. Ground white this morning
and very very cold. Papa, Ned, and
S B went to meeting and got on
very well though snow and ice
till they reached Monkstown avenue
where a slippery part was too much
for the poor blind horse whose feet
were quite unprepared for the frost,
and down he went on his hind legs.
poor fellow! he did his best evidently
to keep up, but it was too much,
They called at Glendruid and found
Grandmama pretty well .......
Uncle Frederick John, Mr Jennings and
Alfred Webb dined here -
10 - Charlie and Philip had a great
days shooting and brought home
3 hares 2 rabbits a woodcock and [deletion]af[/deletion] snipe.
This was another lovely day
Papa has just come out from town
[Incorrect line] not go
[Incorrect line] as it
