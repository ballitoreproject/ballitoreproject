My dear Aunt
I recieved thy very welcome letter yesterday
morning and was rejoiced to get it and to find thou
had [insertion]not[/insertion] forgot me.
ask her what thou bid me, she bid me tell thee that she
has not spun any yet but intends to begin next
week if she be able, as she complains almost constanly
of the [underline]beating of her heart[/underline] and a weakness
in her Stomach, [unclear]apropos[/unclear] I am glad to hear thine is so
well, I hope it may continue so.
message to Thomas Glaiabrook as he has resigned all pretentions
to [underline]Mary[/underline] and [underline]Membership,[/underline] and has asked for
our Susan's sister Ellen, and I suppose they will be
married in a short time; Burton says that he will
get a guinea and good belly-full for marrying them,
and that he admires his taste in not marrying that
little, rotten, servant-maid, so he is pleased to [unclear]tern[/unclear]
Mary; but I think he will hardly get us good, in
Ellen, as she goes by the name of a great [underline]courter.[/underline]
I went to Peggy Lay yesterday evening to
My mother said I need not give thy

Now my dear aunt I fear this will be
a very uninteresting letter, but such as it is, I
hope it will be received by thee, with thy wonted
goodnature, and will be answer'd in process of
time.
I really cannot find much more matter
so I believe I must soon conclude thy love was
very acceptable to all, in return Mary Kelly sends
thee her [underline]blessing.[/underline] and most ardent wishes for thy
return, indeed all wish for thee, and I hope thou
wilt soon gratify their wishes.
Mary Stephens will soon be going
to Dublin for a month she intends bringing
Gray don and leaving him at home also Jane Stephens,
who I fear she will leave behind.
I hope thou will excuse this very
bad writing as my pen is not good and I am almost
tired writing. M & A Doyle my mother &
father join me in dear love to thee and I remain
thy affectionate niece

old I will tell thee what happened to prevent thy getting

to send to thee and thought it was gone when lo! the
other [insertion]day[/insertion] I found it upstairs "well says I to my myself "I'll send
that it is so old as I can't write another! one that is
my excuse and I hope thou wilt receive [insertion]it as one[/insertion] Pens as usual
bad and myself much hurried it being just 10 and
I should be at school at [unclear][/unclear] after 9. farewell thy
