10 Monday - A wet morning alas! alas! for
our poor little pic- However as no
objection was raised we thought we would
drive down to meet them at all events -
and bring the [unclear]prog[/unclear] in case they [underline]should[/underline]
come - and it was well we did so for
who should we spy in one of the carri[unclear]ages[/unclear]
as the train rolled up but Florence and
Charles Bewley whom Phil had invited
to help him out as bachelor - so there
was half our party but where was
the other - alas! safe at home we supp[unclear]osed[/unclear]
for no where did they appear -. And
now only for Papa [insertion]who accompanied us so far on[/insertion] we should have bee[unclear]n[/unclear]
in a regular hobble - he proposed at
once sending one of the boys off
for Bessie and Miss Bell by next
train - which motion was cordially
seconded by us, and we drove off
closely packed in the covered car, our
hopes raised, and very jolly under
creditable circumstances. Just
as we were stopping at the post, who
should drive up in the very nick of
time but Phil who on hearing the
state of the case volunteered at once
to start off for the girls. So away
[underline]he[/underline] went and off [underline]we[/underline] drove to Bally[unclear]man [/unclear]
[deletion]Still[/deletion] The rain all this time was
descending in rather a persevering discouraging
for that when we had a snug little
manner - but what matter
