 Dear [unclear]Cockran[/unclear]
As I have been engaged
during the greater part of last week
holding meetings in Bangor Down
Patrick Killough and [unclear]Ardglass[/unclear]
and did not return to Belfast
until saturday morning when
your letter was handed to me
and as soon as was possible
I saw Joseph Burne and gave
him the letter so that no time
will be lost in getting all the
money that is due to [unclear]Darnely[/unclear] and
she as I have received a letter from
Ballamena where I am to
speak on thursday next and
at [unclear]Killelea[/unclear] on [unclear]Friday[/unclear] and
there is to be a [unclear]tea[/unclear] Party at
 [unclear]Legand[/unclear] village on tuesday so
 that in the neighbourhood
 of Belfast there is plenty of
work for the next weeks

The expenses will all be paid
at Ballamara and Killelea
you ought to send me some
numbers of the Herald as the
persons whom I ask wish to
see it in its enlarged form
 before they [unclear]subrule us[/unclear] it.
On Monday the 10th instant I
held a meeting in Bangor the
school house belonging to the
new connecion of Methodist kindly
granted by the Revd. Mr. Argene
who opened the meeting by some
introductory observations and
then called upon Lieutenant
Adam who stated that he
was a total abstainer and
was convinced that it was
the only principle that could
be practically beneficial to
the working classes I was then
called on to address the meeting
and at the conclusion several
persons came forward and
[unclear]signed[/unclear] the pledge
about 200 persons were present
on Tuesday evening the 11th instant
I had the pleasure of attending
a [unclear]memerous[/unclear] meeting of the frends
of total abstinence in Down Patrick
since my first visit to the town
our cause has prospered and
weekly meetings are held
As the Editor of the Down Patrick
Recorder was present and has
promised to give a report of that
meeting in his next paper
I need only say that the greatest
drunkard in the town came
forward and saved our necks
our [unclear]Tea[/unclear] Party at Killough was
a delightful one there is a
a great report of it in the
Recorder - [deletion]thy[/deletion] in my next letter
you shall have an account
of Ardglass and the other
meetings so wishing you every
success in the good cause I remain
your brother in the
cause. M C Walker.
