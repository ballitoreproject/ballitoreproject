My Dear Freind [sic]
R. Shackleton


        I understand by a Letter from H. Haughton that thou apprehends me in thy debt which am sensable [sic] of in many respects for thy kindness to me  yet may inform my Esteemed freind [sic] that I wrote to him a little before He went to England and have not since been favored with a Letter  would not have thus long delayed writeing [sic] only from a fear of being troublesome by a second Address because that I feel the weakness of my own Abilitys [sic] in every sense and also know unto whom I write have allways [sic] esteemed esteemed it a condescending favor thy requesting to hear from [word crossed out] ^me^ but thy silence together with a very low situation of Mind caused me to think thou hadst withdrawn thy Corrispondence [sic] yet I hope not thy freindship [sic]. I know I dont [sic] deserve the rememberence [sic] of any. Yet Relegious [sic] minds are freequently [sic] exercised on account of the most unworthy in the Family.
I wrote a week ago to thy Daughter Sally which suppose she have receiveda Letter from her when convenient hope she beleives [sic] will be acceptable. With respect to Freinds [sic] in this City there seems not much alteration except that our Freind [sic] Frances Peet was removed from us by Death about two months ago she was confined to her Bed about a Month grew gradualy [sic] weaker and weaker she departed very quietly I beleive [sic] without sign or Groan doubt not but thou and thy Wife remembered her she was almost blind some years before her Death this Meeting is much on the decline boeth [sic] as to Number and am affraid [sic] the best things which must be cause of mourning and sorrow of heart to the few who are yet alive.. beleive [sic] I mentioned in my Letter to Sally that John Pemberton and William Mathews [sic] had payed [sic] us a Relegious [sic] Visit which was I beleive [sic] very satisfactory would be oblidged [sic] to thee when thou sees ^them^ if thou thinks it suitable to mention my Love to them.. but its [sic] not likely that they will remember either me or my Name would like if it was right to see them again before they leave this Nation but ^that^ do not seem probable
        I am situated pretty much as when I wrote last only that I lodge at my Mothers and mostly spend the Evenings with her  please to present my Dear Love to thy Wife for may truly say I feel it gratefully & freequently [sic] Wish there was a few such Examples in Limerick but alas that must not be expected from the present appearence [sic] of things. I wish to be remembered affectionately to thy
        Family in general & am with respectfull [sic]
                Affection thy Friend Anna Taverner


PS 
        request that no one may see this but thyself Wife or Daughters
