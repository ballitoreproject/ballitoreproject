My dear Cousin,


        +++ I have just re-perused thy letter, & am pleased to find that any of my communications afford thee satisfaction  I sincerely desire that we both may be so melted down, so moulded, changed & fashioned, that we may each be that very thing which the Lord would have us to be  then moving in our respective orbits round the great Luminary of heaven & earth we shall be attracted towards it as our center, & one to ^towards^ another in such meet proportion as Infinite Wisdom shall appoint +++++
        A little conversation entered into with the young & tender , the visited children, in the right opening & freedom of spirit, causes a reciprocation of Good  I was lately sitting by poor, dear A:Ts bedside  We began a little conversation; an humble, tendering sense ensued, & I believe somewhat of Good was near  She remains the same afflicted, comforted  distressed & supported creature ++++

        There are divers of our acquaintance who seem to be about taking their flight to that land from whence there is no return  Perhaps some of us may have to stay a little longer in this world  May best Wisdom conduct our steps in the midst of a crooked & perverse generation! May we put on Christ, his nature & spirit, who was meek & lowly in heart!  who, [page number] 116 when he was reviled, reviled not again: when he suffered, he threatened not  but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously  This is the spirit, which will carry us through, & by which we shall, in the Lords time, (the best time) know an overcoming  Depend on it  the deeper we go down in baptism, the more fully we are washed from all filthiness of flesh & spirit, & the more perfectly we fulfil in humility & patience all our respective preparatory dispensations, the more polished & beautiful will be the stones of memorial which we shall bring up, the more clear will our innocence & integrity be manifested, & the more solid & permanent will be our peace. ^[pencil XX^ I have an earnest desire, my dear friend, for thy being perfectly right  I do not want thee to be great & eminent, and conspicuous in any line  but whatever thou art, though ever so little, that it may be of the Lords creation & formation  Gold is said to be the most heavy, as it is reckoned the most precious of all metals  Whatever there is in thy spiritual stock, though ever so small, may it be pure, beaten Gold! He, whom thou desirest to serve, he, who has led thee in an humiliating, tribulated path; as thy eye is single to him, will shew thee, will instruct & direct thee in the way that thou shouldst go; & if thou walkest faithfully in it, will give thee the sure seal, the internal evidence of Divine approbation, & as much favour & acceptance with men, as will tend to thy profit in every respect +++++
Farewell, my beloved friend! Mayest thou prosper in every good work & work!
