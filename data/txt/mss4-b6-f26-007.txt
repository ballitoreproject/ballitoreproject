Dublin: 26th of 1st month 1791 -
Now for the first time I address my dearest William by the
title of Husband, with a heart glad to be able to call him so, & desirous
to deserve it, & with feelings of inexpressible tenderness towards
him, notwithstanding how contradictory to those feelings this act
of mine may seem - how deeply I regret my inconsiderateness I need
not repeat; that I should come hither for the sake of meer amusement,
leaving thee involved in bustle & cumber often sting me to the heart,
& made me resolve never to do so more, "Twas the soft voice of friendship,
"that called me away," but the softer plea of love, why was it not heard,
& the stronger of duty! However I am mindful of thy advice to take [unclear]comfort[/unclear]
since [underline]I am[/underline] come, & not grieve thee with my complaining. I feel comfortable
in this dear, little parlour, where our sweet Susan received me
with a cordial embrace & expressions of her satisfaction. We desired our
Driver to leave word at Dennis's how we got on; he was very attentive &
obliging, & the horses performed very well. - We got to Sallins before 12,
& expecting the boat every minute did not get out of the carriage; but
it was near an hour ere the first boat came, which being greatly crowded,
& we hearing the other was very near, concluded to stay for that;
kept our station for more than another hour, when we began to be rather
uneasy, but resolved not to fret, seeing that would increase our inconvenience
at length the boat appeared; it had been delayed by the rudder breaking
I suppose - the cabbin was throng there also, at the upper end were Isaac &
Nancy

Nancy Gatchell, Nancy & Chrissy Neale; but we did not get to speak
to them till a little before we left the boat, as we could only get seated at
the [deletion]far[/deletion] [insertion]near[/insertion] end, & the company or some of them, being engaged at cards, the
room warm, & other [underline]dissatisfactions[/underline] made us repair to the Landlady's little
room, which she kindly accommodated us with, & let us dine there, being
supplied by Mansergh's care with a comfortable repast from the other table
about 4 o'clock, which our empty stomachs wanted much. Mansergh was
very kind & obliging & we found his care very needful, nor did he leave
us till John Walker & Tommy Bewley met us at the 5th lock. Our precious
M: Bewley was most of the way wrapt in these soft sorrows, which
I believed & she owned were comfortable to her, & she was glad to feel them;
she hopes our dear Sally will not think anything else prevented her going
to bid her again farewell, nor could she take leave of the girls in the kitchen,
which she seemed to regret. They have account here of the death of their
aunt Metcalf which event took place about 7 o'clock this morning. We
hear that Jno Dawson has had a letter this day from Jas. Pemberton, which
mentioned Mary Ridgway & Jane Watson being well, farther particulars
have not learned. I may say all this kind family, but particularly the
girls [insertion]& M: Mellor[/insertion] join me in dear love to father, mother, brother, sisters & thyself.
I shall long for a letter from thee, & hope thou wilt be particular in mentioning
thy own dear health & how mother is, to whom I need not beg thy
attention when she shall be left so lonely, I have transgressed my duty to
thee & her I fear. I wish to hear when any account is from Athy, & whether
MHudson returns home. And now farewell, my dearest friend, & however blameworthy
my present conduct, wilt thou not excuse it? for my heart warrants my
subscribing myself thy affectionate wife Mary Leadbeater.

William Leadbeater
Ballitore.
