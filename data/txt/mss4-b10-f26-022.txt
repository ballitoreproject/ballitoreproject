Dresden April 28th 1847
My dearest Mother
We arrived here from our
excursion on Monday last and only found
one letter awaiting us which very much
disappointed me for it was three weeks old
you must not have written to me when
I desired you or I would have received one
of a later date - I shall not here now until
I go to Hamburgh and I am very uneasy
at being thus in the dark with regard
to how you are at home - indeed it has
greatly taken from my enjoyment &
I am very anxious to be at home, we
leave this on Saturday morning for Berlin
and hope to reach Hamburgh on Sunday
evening and hope to find a vessel for
Hull ready to start wh will be a long
voyage but it is [insertion]a[/insertion] much cheaper route

than to London - I do not exactly know
what day we can be at home for it is quite
impossible to find out either the time of rail
roads or steam packets starting they are so
constantly changing - neither do I know if
we are to stop at all in Hamburgh - Mary Henry
has friends there & may wish to see them -
we do not intend stopping at Berlin -
I fear very much for poor Dickey, indeed I have
had little hope from the accounts since I left
home of his recovery except that youth and
the fine weather coming on might enable
him to rub through - poor Edward! I think he
is in that is to be felt for - it seems almost a
greater trial to lose his son now after all
he has suffered than even at the first -
knowing all the anxiety you have had
at home has been a great damper to my
enjoyment here - and then hearing so
seldom makes it a great deal worse - I
had no idea of our being so long away
when I told you after a certain date to write
to Hamburgh - it is quite provoking because
I could easily have had one or even two more.
30th I was called away from this and then thought
I might as well not send it until we were nearer
the point of starting - we have every thing arranged
for setting off by first train in the morning from
this and hope we shall be at home very soon
after you receive this letter - we have been
pretty busy these few days seeing things
we could not do before we went on our
trip viz the Picture Gallery Greenvaults &c
but I am not going to tell any thing about
them here as I hope soon to see you and
we have an appointment to meet James
at a particular hour and must soon be
away - the weather is now fine and even
since we returned here we can observe the
trees growing greener and the garden about
the suburbs are settling up & flowers [insertion]being[/insertion] put out
in them that have been kept in houses all winter
they look already very gay - all fear of frost returning
seems now to be over & preparations for sitting
in the open air making every where - James
& family leave this in about two weeks on their
way to Switzerland & Italy - [underline]Mr&Mrs Evans[/underline] stay
here with the Model a while longer but what

they do next or whither they will go I cannot
tell nor can they themselves yet - There are
great preparations making in this town
for a fair or large Market to be held next
week - we shall miss it but as we have
seen Leipsic fair we can pretty well judge
what it will be - I would be obliged by Elzh.
writing a few lines on receipt of this to Liverpool
(post office) that we might hear even there
for I know I shall be very nervous about
news from home after such a long time
of ignorance of every thing relative to you.
I could not I am sure ever make up my
mind to leave home to travel for any length
of time if I were to be so long as I have been without
getting a letter - nor indeed I believe on any
conditions when I leave dear ones behind me
I trust I shall find you well, [underline]all well[/underline], except
my poor Dickey that I cannot I suppose hope
to find well, nor I much fear even better - with
dear love to all & in hopes of soon seeing
you I am my dear Mother your affection
daughter EH
