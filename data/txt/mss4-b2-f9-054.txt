Ballitore: 13/11 month. 1781.
My dear Cousin,

	I was favoured with thy Letter in Dublin, which was very acceptable to me - The sight of thy near connexions there (who are also my dear friends) was very pleasing - Thy father indeed seemed low in his mind - I wish it had been put in my power to afford the worthy old-man any consolation - Tis pity that in the decline of life, & of a life well-spent, troubles should be accumulated, instead of being diminished - but from one quarter or another we all may expect our share of them - I had little or no opportunity of private conference with him or his son James, or any other except John Gough concerning affairs in your province - with John I had some little & but little communication - I fear there has been a talking & a writing about persons & things, which has not tended to heal, nor to restore - Strength has (I fear) been wasted that way, which if preserved entire, & exerted under the influence of Divine Love, in proper time & place, might probably have been rendered effectual to the making up this very dangerous breach. In short, that Love which is not only the badge of discipleship, but the very bond that unites disciples together, has been too much wanting - and till all parties get down so deep as to witness this sacred spring to arise in their minds, I know not what benefit they can receive from instrumental labour - I thought I had rather a cool Reception from T: G: - his first salutation damped me - yet at several times I thought his publick Ministry was attended with life & power - & whom the great Master delighteth to honour we should be very cautious of censuring, even in thought, lest words or actions should escape from us, which may transfuse a spirit of party-prejudice into our children, or others, that like a Canker may eat out all Good - Let us not strive to overcome Evil with Evil, but seek to overcome evil with good - How beautiful is the apostolick advice, Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual restore such a one in the spirit of meekness, considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted. Bear ye one anothers burdens, & so fulfill the law of Christ. Though thus I write, my dear Cousin, I am far from thinking that thou opposest Evil to Evil - but when the spirit is irritated by ill usage, there is danger attends the provocation, A serpent by the way, an adder in the path; that biteth the horse-heels, so that his rider shall fall backward - This falling backward is what we should guard against. I question that any Friend had private communication with T: G: on the subjects which have given uneasiness - Had he begun with me, & I had found my mind properly composed & qualified, I might probably have told him my mind sentiments: but a co-incidence of favourable circumstances does not always fall out as one would wish.
	 I hope our Meeting in Dublin was in measure owned, & not barren of profit & edification - though to compose times with times, by reason of the general depravity, it may be said to have been a poor season: and some of our greatest Solemnities, in comparison of former days may be termed only Solemn Fasts - I wish each of us may endeavour with all diligence to get one to be in a state of Rectitude & Acceptance -
	Thou wilt have heard (to be sure) of the terror which my family was put into by a mad, or wicked man - Through the very good kindness of our Sovereign Protector & Benefactor, I dont perceive any ill consequences to have flowed from it - My wife & children appear to enjoy usual health & spirits - She was in Athy with Debby, & I was at Timahoe-side joining some friends on a family-visit there, when it happened - Debby & her little one (I suppose) are well - but I hear she is obliged to resign the office of giving suck, to an hireling - I believe it is so best - By last accounts from Peggy, they were pretty well there - her youngest (Richard) had been very weakly, took breast-milk out of a cup, & after being weaned several months, had taken to the breast itself again, which seemed to agree with & nourish him - We expect Edith Lovell here to night on her way to Cork, which she is concerned to visit. Moll Whalen (the fat woman) is married - I believe (Since I wrote the last word Dean Keatings came in & told me he had performed the ceremony, so I may say) Sally Bayly (eldest daughter of the widow Susy Bayly) was married yesterday to Edward Kennedy, who has a place of Residence in this neighbourhood, a young man of loose morals - the match much against her mothers inclination - Betty Johnson is brought to bed of a daughter - We had Letters by last port from Tottenham, from Morris Birkbecks wife & son - She does not throu off her disorder (the Jaundice), has a violent itching I suppose from the Bile, I believe has by this time set out for Bath. Inclosed I write to the parties whose bond I have, according to thy Fathers recommendation - If he thinks the Letter is proper, request he will seal, & forward it.
	I would (as always) be glad to hear from thee when convenient, & to know how all thy Relations got home, & how they are after their journey, particularly how thy brother James finds himself since his return - We got home safe & well 8th instant - Jacob Martin Junior , his wife & sister Poole were in company with us, as also Andrew Delap [?] - the latter talks of going a little into the farming-business - I doubt he is not quite steady, though he appears very orderly - I am always pleased to hear of that old disciple James Moreton - Whether I shall ever have the satisfaction of seeing him again in this life is uncertain, though I do not altogether despair of it. but I have no doubt but that having passed through many tribulations & exercises of various kinds, his end will be Peace - And till that end arrives, I wish his mind so stayed, composed & centered in & by Divine Favour, that his last days may be the most happy, pleasant & comfortable of his life - Please present him with the Salutation of my wifes & my fresh & cordial love & Sympathy - Remember us also very dearly to those of thy own household, & near Connexions above mentioned - Besure my wifes & childrens dear love constantly attends thee, & that I am
My dear Debbys
affectionate friend & kinsman
Richard Shackleton.
