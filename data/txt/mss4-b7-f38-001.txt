Ballitore, 15th of June 1780.
My dear & much
beloved friend,
I think it almost time to acquaint you of my situation
which indeed for a good part of the time since you left this place
has been very deplorable to me. I have been dangerously ill with various
complaints all over my whole body, it was very severe, for the time
it held which was not above four days, when all fell into my leg which
if it had not been for the kind hand of providence, who has ever been
more merciful to me than what I deserved, & the good nature of Surgeon
Johnson who was very kind to me, I think I should not have
recovered it; it was then indeed I was in a deplorable state, I think
I was almost as desolate as Robinson Crusoe when in his lonesome
Island, I had no one to hand me a drink of water, nor to come
near me, when able to take food. I had like to have been starved
before any one took notice of me; it was then indeed I had reason
to lament that you, your Mother & Sister was far from me, I
could not blame your younger Sister, nor neither do I, as 'till the
worst was over; she heard nothing of my illness, nor had I any one
to send to her; I think I have continued long enough on this melancholy
subject, time to entertain you on something more agreeable.
Most

Most part of the time in my illness Patt: came over once in the
Twenty four hours to see me, he generally came at night, whenever
there was Milk in the house he made whey, would stay to keep
me company 'till almost day, he seemed greatly troubled. I believe
that was only deceit, for you know my dear, there are
few men that are not deceitful; nevertheless when all is said &
done he took most care of me of any one, when in my greatest
extremity, I think my father came once to see me, & my Mother
not at all. I should make a great deal of difference between
that & the poor fellow who had three Miles to come every
night for six nights. please to let me know in your Letter
as I shortly expect one, which of my Parent or friend I should
love best. I have got several Letters from my best friend
since your departure, he has been very ill, but thanks to
the Almighty both he & I are recovering, & I hope with
a Blessing that you he & I will meet all together at Ben:
Haughton's wedding which I expect will be this day five week
please not to stay out any longer, for indeed Ballitore looks
very lonesome to me without the two flowers I most esteem, It
often grieves my heart when I see all other young women walking

& I do not see them I think most about, in the number; besides
I have a great loss of you & I would have much more had [deletion][/deletion] it
not been for the good nature of poor Johny, who is always ready
to serve me, any how at all, I think that it is time enough
for you to stay abroad out of your own sweet native soil,
where so pritty a place I believe you will not see 'till you
see [insertion]it[/insertion] yourself again, in case you went to Corke or Glenmire
itself, Since your departure poor little Richd. has been likely
to trip off. Poor Bet: Lyon's Son is not expected of pritty much
the same disorder, I think when you parted me you promised to
write first, but had it not been for my illness I would have
wrote to you before now, as you have not wrote yet, I expect you
w[unclear][/unclear] answer this, & in so doing you will oblige
your ever loving
& dutiful Servant
[underline](Mary Whelan.)[/underline]
[unclear]P. S.[/unclear]
Both families here are well,
please to let me know how your
Sister & Children are when you will
be pleased to write. pray let no body
see this Letter, I expect Billy will send it.

Miss
Mary Sheckelton.
