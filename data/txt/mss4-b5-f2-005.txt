near Cork 29th of 7th month 1797 -
My dear friend,
At the same time that I [deletion][/deletion] endeavour
to acknowledge thy kindness, may I ask thee to do or get done, a little matter
for me partly in the line of business? It need not be attended with much
trouble to thy William (who no doubt retains sufficient for it of his former
might I not almost say? iniquitous profession) & is only to call on my old
town's woman Mary Garratt with the enclosed deed, wch I expect she
will execute - the business does not, that I know of, require any explanation
or I would probably write directly to her - on reading the paper,
she will, I believe, sufficiently recollect & understand - Being signed (dated
of course) I request it may be forwarded, without delay, to Willm. Pike,
Brookfield, Dungannan, to whom I intend soon to write - it will
probably occur to thy W. S. to have two witnesses, one or both of our society -
It would be both unreasonable & unnecessary to say any thing now
by way of information respecting thy sister Sally, who I suppose,
very soon after thy enquiry was made, personally answered it to your
satisfaction. From late accounts concerning her & S. T, I conclude
they are about this time in Scotland - If they are where & as they
ought to be, wch. we may resonable hope for, let us be satisfied & thankful.

Thou mays't be sure it was grateful thy so kindly showing wth: me the
communication from Edmund Burke's hand - it was that I wished for,
& there always appears something peculiar in it, be the subject what it may -
To see such a Man, so sensible of his situation, & from his feeling expressions,
we may hope in degree resigned thereto, is cause of satisfaction, & much more
than in a general way is to be found or looked for - My Father! My Father!
How fresh does he present! Among his many & various wise, animated
expressions, was this "One only knows the heart" & here, the matter must rest -
A while past I had some conversation about EB, with my neighbour whom
thou alludes to - part of it seemed to correspond wth. thy remark on the nature
of his indisposition, for, in rather a significant manner this person pointed
to his own body - as much as to say, "the wound lies there, & is incurable" - [insertion]or something like it[/insertion]
Since writing the above this morning I met my neighbour (called
Sir Patrick o Conor) & on asking him about EB, found he had been
a month [insertion]ago[/insertion] or thereabout wholly released from all the hurry & bustle, and
vexation wch so long encompassed him. May his "better part" have found
a better mansion"! My being such a stranger in the political world (& I
wish it to be still more the case) probably kept the knowledge of this event
the longer from me - My Mother, no doubt, would feel interested on
the occasion, if his mental faculties were as they have been -
You will, I suppose, hear or perhaps have heard of the late
Saml Pike's daughter being carried off by a Knight, & in some hours recovered -
It has [deletion][/deletion] made such noise & talk that I wish to say
[underline]little[/underline] on the [deletion]priv[/deletion] subject. Poor N. Penrose! A very different & more worthy subject.
I affectionately & cordially salute you there & say Farewell. J. Abell

Mary Ridgway & Janet Watson, after attending our late
quarterly meeting &c, went hence last secon. day morning, 24th inst:,
intending for Garryroan & Limerick -
Please to give my love to M: Garratt & inform me should any obstruction
occur to the deed being signed - Thou'll probably mention
to her my having other occasion of writing to thee -
Perhaps thou'll think me rather laconick respecting so extraordinary
an outrage as that committed on Mary Pike &, in degree, on the
the community - it may be found pretty fully described [unclear][/unclear]
[deletion]in[/deletion] I suppose in many newspapers throu't the nation. [unclear][/unclear],
A melancholly consideration, that she, the daughter of a friend
once an elder in our society, should, by her uncle, be prompted to take an oath
I fear the guilt of it & many other things will, in a large degree, rest on his head.
