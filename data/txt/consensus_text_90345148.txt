as Ellen: However I had soon
reason to be glad she did so -
for I had no sooner mounted
my charger, a mare Philip had
been kind enough to send over
for us, when, unaccustomed
to a habit I suppose, she began
to kick, a kind of exercise I by
no means fancied, I suppose
[underline]she[/underline] did, for she did not rest
till she had landed me safely
on the [deletion][unclear]terra firma[/unclear][/deletion] ground.
Not much relishing this method
of proceeding we thought it better
to defer our ride till after dinner
when we thought we might get
a safer animal to ride - So after
dinner we set off again, this time
I was mounted on Philips filly,
and tho' it was rather showery
had a very pleasant ride to the
Glen of the Downes where Ellen had
never been.
