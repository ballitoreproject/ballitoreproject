Dear Cousins A &. M.S: Skipton 26th: 9mo 1725
Herewth a Salutation & tender
greeting of dr. Love comes unto
yu & frds: from my Self & Wife, Mother & Cousin Eliz
wth hearty desires yt ye healing wing of divine Providence
may be yr Directer & Protecter thro' thy world & may
often bring you to ye Spiritual Rehoboth, where, out
of & delivered from ye noise of Archers ye may partake
of ye living water wch Sanctifies ye Soul, makes fruitful
& gives it Room in ye Land of ye Living, wch Springing
Will also (wn we are favour'd is ye Opening thereof)
makes Hard things easy, bitter things sweet, rough ways
Smooth, &c.
On ye 17th Inst at Ayrton, I took my dearest Ann [insertion]to wife[/insertion], being
favour'd wth dr Good Master's Company & two of his Ministers
viz. Danl. Stevenson & Tho. Carr, we came directly from
Ayrton to Skipton after Meeting. Thus far we are bottom
easy wth each other & wth wt we have done.

To Ww
