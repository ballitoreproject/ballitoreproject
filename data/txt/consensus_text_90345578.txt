turned soon and from her report
I presumed my supposition
was in part correct. Presently
a knock came to the door and
I heard Hannah Pim's voice telling
me Jane Harris was below and
would be glad to see me - So-
down I went and there [insertion]she[/insertion] was
with another young lady a Miss
Likes from Limerick - Their escorts
were outside and we were afterwards
introduced - to them - Two
nice looking young men one
a Green, and the other a Beale -
After dinner letters again and
then a stroll with Hannah Pim
Ned and Alice - Saw (-)
too but he did not see us -
Reading then [insertion]with Ned[/insertion] until 6Â½ 1/2 when
I descended to " the drawing room
where I had a game of draughts
with Alice -. . [unclear]Tea[/unclear] gong summoned
us to the dining room where
we had some interesting conversation
with (-) about Oxygen gas and
inhaling it - &c &c - After tea
