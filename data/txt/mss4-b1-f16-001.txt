I Elenor Greer near Lurgan in the north of Ireland, aged about
80 years, having Lost my Eye sight some time before, being at a
province select meeting in said Lurgan, on or about the 30th of
9th mo: 1733 where was severall ministers & others asembled -
Had a vision which I aprehended as Clearly as if my natural
Eyes had been in their full strength ([unclear]Voy[/unclear]) I saw & beheld Like a
sheet which seemed to me to be hinging over the meeting house
table, as a sign & several Emty Garments thereon, & over them a
Dark Crown without Either Lusture or beauty
And the evening of said day when I was in bed I saw a great
number of men & women riding upon horses fast away in Great
haste, & no children with them, nor any thing Else only their
cloaths, & some of the women had riding hoods about them, each
vision brought a great concern upon me, & Deliberately considering
& weighing the same, the nearest construction that I
can come to is -
The sheet hanging over the table as a sign & several
Emty garments thereon, & over them a Dark Crown without Lusture
or beauty Imployes, a form of Godlyness Disregarding the Power
a profession without enjoying the posession & substance of the
Divine spring, & living presence and life of religion,
whose end must be attended with a Dark Crown when the
crown of the righteous will be bright beautyfull & everlastingly
glorious
And as the great number of men & women rideing away
in great haste without children, I take to be backsliders
unfaithfull professen, and such as as weary with the easie yolk
of Our blessed Lord & sav[insertion]i[/insertion]our Jesus Christe takeing their flight
from Sion, Gods holy hill Either on the summer winter or sa[insertion]b[/insertion]bath
day this easie resting time from persecution, And as there
was no children hasting away, I take to relate to the well
Desposed youth, who are to Remain in the church with Gods
people, to Glorifyie his Great name
