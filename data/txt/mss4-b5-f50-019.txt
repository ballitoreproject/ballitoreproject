My dear aunt.
I don't like to [deletion]let[/deletion] [insertion]send[/insertion] a [unclear]pamp[/unclear]
[deletion]fo[/deletion] to Ballitore without something for thee
in it, who hast so often remembered me in
[unclear]pamps[/unclear] [underline]from[/underline] Ballitore, although I know
not that I have much to say that thou
wilt care about. - My prospects begin to put
on a brighter appearance, & my spirits consequently
much improved.- I have two pupils,
one about 9, the other 10 years old - both
lively & interesting boys - Hardcastle's abilities
appear [insertion]the[/insertion] mo[deletion]st[/deletion][insertion]re[/insertion] [underline]showy[/underline] : - [unclear]Rice's[/unclear] I should
think was mo[deletion]st[/deletion][insertion]re[/insertion] solid : -
I should be very glad to have a few
lines from thee occasionally, if thy numerous
and 12th

avocations would permit thee to devote
any time to me - If thou should happen
to hear any commission in London which
I can execute I shall be happy to do
it for thee. -
How go on thy new Cottage Dialogues?
Are they in the press yet?
Hast thou yet received Prior's Life of
Burke? I sent it some time ago by Counseller
R'Driscol. The author & I have
exchanged visit at each others' houses, but
have not seen each other.
With love to uncle L. "aunt Sally"
& all other friends
I remain thy affect. [deletion]fr[/deletion][insertion]nephew[/insertion]
