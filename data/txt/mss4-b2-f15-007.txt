I sit down with a mind humbled under a sense of its own unworthiness - of that mercy & truth which has followed us - to salute you & yours in tenderest affection - being assurd we have felt a Love superior to outward eyes - & which is not confind to [our struck through] personal communication - being frequently made sensible when in your Land - of the help of your spirits - & as the prayers of the righteous awaiteth much. I crave them - for my encrease in religious stability - that by building on the sure foundation - I may be enabled to stand the many storms that may yet be permitted 
        my Dear Companion joins me in remembring [sic] you with much esteem & gratitude - she seems to be reaping the reward of her sacrifice & I believe is thankful she has been amongst you - which is also my case - for I hope I have been instructed - by being as Dear Rutly[?] sometimes said - amongst my letters - and am nearly united to the living in general - & to some of you as in a covenant - which I trust will be perpetual. I covet that the visited youth may bring forth fruits - to the great Masters praise - that so you my honourd Friends - who have long borne the burden & heat of the present day - may be revivd in hope - that the Cause you have with stability contended for will be supported by your own Children. I need not say they are to me as a Brother & Sisters 
I may truely say the remembrance of you is precious to me - & that your communications will be esteemd a favour - that to Clonmel[?] humbled me. I accounted it no small mark of my Masters [struck through] kindness - to be so Affectionately noticed - but to Him I look as the great source of all blessings - & as I owe much - I wish to be enabled to Love much - but am Jealous over myself.   
our Dear Friend Samuel Ally [?] can give you the particulars of our Journey home - where we found all our near connections well & was favourd to meet in some degree with Joy - & now to be enabled patiently to wait - & quietly to hope for the Salvation of God - seems to be my proper business - & from which great object - I wish my attention may never be improperly drawn - & then I do hope - tho we are separated in Body we shall at times be present in spirit - & one anothers Joy in the Lord 
        tell Dear Abraham that I view Him as a willing Scholar in the best of Schools - that while he is communicating instruction to others - He is looking to his own Master - & thus becoming wise unto Salvation - & of this Wisdom - I trust the Church will encreasingly [sic] reap the benefit-- Dear Mary also seems to be looking for higher attainments - & her Beloved Sister Sarah - will I hope like the good scribe bring out of the treasury, things new & old, she is near to my Life - & her faithfulness is my Joy. Dr M  Grub also comforted us - with her offerings - thus my Dear Friends are you blest -
our Beloved Friends D.Owen & R Young - are soon to set out on a Religious visit to Cheshire & Staffordshire Rebecca desired her dear Love might be conveyd 
        It is so pleasant to me to commune with you that I could say much more - would time admit - but must close - with the united Dr Love of all our family with Dr A Summerland + J Applebys to you & yours - & enquiring Friends 
                        I remain you obligd Friend
