My dear Father,
        I received thy truly acceptable letter, & was pleased to find thou had got safe home, after accompanying our dear friends in the performance of their duty, & having done thy own is returned I believe in Peace. I did not admire to hear of dear Mary Bewleys enlargement, it is what I should expect, & I wish she may be preserved from being damped by any North wind of discouragement from those who have not become simple or reduced enough themselves, for acceptable service in the Church in much ^any great^ degree: but that whether it be either or North or South wind that blows upon her Garden it may alternately cause the spices to flow out, consoling to her friends & edifying to the Society
        I know thy great desire is for Truths prosperity, & art now finely set at liberty for the promotion thereof, it is a great favour to have such a heart, & to be preserved from being overcharged with care; but Care thou knows we must have, even of a Worldly nature, whilst we have a large & helpless family, if Women would keep from marrying they might be freed from a deal of care & anxiety attendant on the marriage state, my Mother can tell something of the cares of this life, having them even in old age to combat with. I am pleased to hear she is pretty well, that Molly is finely, & the child thriving. I wrote Sally by 2nd day nights post, loath to defer waiting for a free conveyance, as I thought myself so long without addressing any of my kindred there, & mentioned how we have been, the children continue to recover, Sam is hoarse still, but a little better, my cough also a little better, & my spirits tolerable good. It was pleasant to hear of Richard Shackletons [sic] amendment, I have not seen my Brothers letter yet, which he refers to, but heard it conveyed agreeable intelligence of his excursion to the North. Anne is now come home to live, & is very useful to me, but I fear my gain is her loss, as it deprives her from pursuing different branches of learning, a Master attends her at home for writing & ciphering, her capacity is reckoned good; she is a steady child.
I am obliged by thy account of Richard, I wished to hear from him. Brother Robert is returned & Henry, & looks well after his journ^e^y, I was there yesterday evening at the School meeting, it was a silent one, I have not heard Anne Tuke ^in testimony &c^ since came [sic], nor any one in this meeting, she sets us an example of silence. Poor Betty Whitton is to be buried this day. I have written to Sally particulars of the removal of several friends here, it has been a time of great stopping [?] by death.
        My Husband joins in dear love to you all thy 
        dutiful & affectionate MGrubb
