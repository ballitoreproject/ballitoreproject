Dublin Sept. 11th 1827
Dr Madam
As I am confident you would be
pleased to hear of any change in my prospects
which might contribute to my advantage. I
am happy to inform you I am now permanently
situated and conducting the Editorship of
the "Dublin Morning Post." at a salary of
120Â£ a year. I have a great [unclear]plan[/unclear] of the
business to attend to and experience much
inconvenience from sitting up late. however
from the many sources of advancement and
Interest comm.ted with the situation. I feel
a deal of pleasure and contentment in
attention and application. I have nothing
of interest to attend to unless that I am
preparing the third edition of my Poem,
(with some new ones) for the Press.

In the course of a few weeks I
shall pay a short visit to Ballitore.
Please to remember me to Mr [unclear]R[/unclear]. Shackleton
and the rest of your amiable family,
And believe me
yours faithfully & sincerely
Hugh Clarke
47 Henry St
P.S. I expect to be able very shortly
to get the memoirs of Micheal Dunn.

My [unclear][/unclear] most affectionate love to my
kind uncle & aunt- you will be
so good as to tell them of my good
fortune
