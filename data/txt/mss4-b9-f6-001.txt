My dear Eliza
I this day recd.
your welcome letter from Glendruid
I had formerly been
wishing [underline]you[/underline] would write &
tell more particular then
I could hear from others.
these several days past &
There was at Dogs [unclear][/unclear] 
get quite nervous just before
the post arrives. [unclear]Merecliffe[/unclear]
wrote twice for what give
him my thanks, but he
is so laconic. I hope
you will find time to write
a few lines on receipt and
might I add daily untill
I can get up to see my
dear Mother, I hope
and indeed I think, [unclear]focus[/unclear]
what you tell me that
she is not so seriously ill
as she fancies herself, still

I [unclear]sought[/unclear] judge for myself
It is a delicate matter
to [unclear]march[/unclear] Sarah down here
with a view of her having
the charge of Magt without
[underline]me[/underline], I must therefore if
I can at all stay a few
day after her arrival to
judge of her matter may
go on. If Magt. continues
as well as she has been
the last few days there will
be no difficulty about it.
If it were not the presumption
now doubt whether but that
she will be quite well as
soon as we could at all expect
shall I say in a couple of months.
Except for an absent someone
occasionally a stranger
I should say I had
could not have anything
ailed her. I
hope we shall be properly
grateful for so great
a blessing as her recovery
will be. Mary Davis
[unclear][/unclear] & Mary & I gave
your kind message
Sends her love, will
you give my dear love
to my Mother and tell
how well we get on
here and that I hope
soon to see her and
find her much recovered
your very affectionate
EB
I hope to hear from you
soon again
