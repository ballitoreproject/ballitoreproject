My dear James,  


Thy letter giving account of dear Ediths sailing &c, &c, was very acceptable I hope thou wilt not fail to send me on the wing the first intelligence thou receives of her getting across the water. +++ Thou asks whether I intend for Cork - I answer in the negative - I wish to tarry in a quiet and peaceful dwelling, bearing my own burdens, plunged in my own baptisms, agitated with my own exercises, performing my own reasonable duties till a way seems to open for any excursion - I desire to be made solid & substantial, not tossed  about like a feather with every breath of wind, & airy notion - I know I greatly lack Wisdom & understanding, & I fervently pray for it when I can +++
I have much satisfaction in Abraham and Lydia - their converse is rational -their conduct dutiful - their manners pleasing - But above all the religious savour to be felt about them, & the humility of their hearts endear them to me - Their particular attention to my wife, & her affection for them are very agreeable circumstances.
[page number] 206 Poor, dear Edward Hatton is still tried - I would be glad to hear that if it proved consistent with Infinite Wisdom to grant him respite from these exercises but as they are no doubt permitted for a good end, Patience & Resignation are what is to be sought after, & I believe are his happy experience.
