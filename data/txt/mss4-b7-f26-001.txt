My dear Friend
I find thy Niece AG has a
Frank for Ballitore, and as I believe it will be
acceptable to my Friends there to have Intelligence
of dear H & AT, I am induced to inform thee,
that, by a letter which I received last Evening,
they landed safely, after a Passage of 33 Hours.
Nancy was not so sick as in coming over,
Henry much the same, but Betsy Pike and
most of the other passengers [insertion]were[/insertion] very sick.
They expected to dine at Home to [unclear]Dar[/unclear]
and hoped to see dear S. Taylor [insertion]on their Way[/insertion] as they
heard on landing that she was still alive.
I shall be obliged by thy presenting my
dear love to thy Father & Mother, thy Wife
and thy Brother Abraham & Sister Lydia
I so very gratefully remember thy attention
and Kindness shewn me in thy Father's
House. Farewel my dr Frd. I have not Time

Jane Taylor
Mary Ledbeater
Ballitore
to add more than that I am thy affectionate
2nd Evening
