Ballitore 9th of 4th month 1791 1771

Dear friend,
++ We have at length (finally, as it looks at present) lost the agreeable family of thy relations from this place. According to my small measure of any right sense, I believe that the offers of much Good are to several of [three words crossed out] that family. May they receive the salutation of the Angel of the Divine Presence, the Messenger of the holy covenant, as a mark of special grade and favour, and cherish and cultivate the visitation as their highest honour! If the visited from on high amongst them keep pace, in their obedience, with the manifest requirings of duty, in matters of great of lesser moment, happy in every respect will it be for them: if they give the [page number] 10 predilection in their hearts to the world and its spirit, the great (perhaps the irretrievable) loss will be theirs, and some of us will have accumulated sorrow.
