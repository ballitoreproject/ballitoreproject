My dear sister,
to take thee, but finding she is not [underline]yet[/underline] gone, & having received
thine this day I thought I would send thee a fresh bit with the
old. I was very anxious to hear from thee; on thine & Eliza's account
particularly; but I by no means (even in thought) blamed
thy silence. I know how thou art cumbered, & do feel for thee more
than I appear to do. I am concerned to hear Eliza has had another
pull back, yet am in hopes as this fine Spring weather [deletion]weather[/deletion]
advanceth she will recruit. Thou pains me by saying any thing
of being [underline]obliged to me[/underline], I frequently at the time, & since, thought I
did very little to asist thee in thy family. I took good care of
myself, & kept myself warm & snug, & enjoyed thy company, which
was a treat to me; & I believe I shall always think it
a gratification either to have it in Clonmel or Ballitore,
or elsewhere. I read that part of thy letter about meeting
me in Youghal[deletion]l[/deletion] to Sarah Neale, she did not at all agree to it,
especially as I have had little (very little) of her husband's company;
we expect him just before it, I fancy. If wishing would
do any good; my beloved sister Peggy has the best wishes of a
poor creature, who often hardly dare even to wish. I am poor
too indeed, but perhaps it goes down better with [underline]me[/underline], who (I fancy)
knows not what riches are. I had but one letter [underline]from Ballitore[/underline]
since I came here, & that the day after, except one from G. Dillwyn
part of which I think to transcribe. "It is no doubt in wisdom that we
"poor travellers are kept low; for if it were otherwise we might incline to
"nestle down too long at our stages, concluding while we had plenty in hand
"we need not toil for more. Hence we find, in an outward respect, the necessities
"of the Poor prompt them to exertions which the Rich seldom submit
"to - they watch & wait, & if honest are glad of any little job whereby to
"procure a subsistance; And we find a habit of industry is like an estate
"to them; it preserves them independent so that they need neither to beg or
"steal from others. Thus our gracious Master, when there is a willingness
"to serve him, not only furnishes employment to his humbly depending Poor,
"according to their several Ability, but recompenses their little labours of love
"with Peace." Poor dear Brother Samuel I hope he has had no return
of his complaint. It was a sad venture for thee to be drying your clothes

A few days ago I gave Mary Moore a letter

by the fire, I wish time may prove thou got no hurt by it.
I hear little Richard Chandlee has been very poorly. My Mother
& sister Lydia were also complaining in Mt.mellick. I intend
taking this in my pocket to Town tomorrow, & giving it to
Mary Moore, if she should still delay going I hope it will not
matter being an oldish date: dear woman! it is as if I wished
her gone, which is not the case. Be asured my dear sister
I am not indifferent about thee, or thine, but am in true warm
affection & sympathy, thy [underline] obliged [/underline]. S: Shackleton
affection & sympathy, thy [underline]obliged[/underline].
