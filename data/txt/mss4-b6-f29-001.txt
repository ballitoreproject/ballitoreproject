New Ross Septb. 28th 99
I'm afraid my Dear Mrs. Leadbeater
will long since have condemn'd me for ingratitude, appearance
is certainly against me, its' three weeks last Monday since I parted
from you my good Friend, never shall I forget the happy time I
pass'd at Ballitore nor the regret I felt at leaving it.
Our Journey was a pleasant one, the weather was very favorable the
Country look'd beautiful, I rode my Mare from Thomas Town which
I was very glad I did, the road being so bad as to render it almost
impossible for a Carriage to go without accident. I sent your Letter
immediately on my arrival, we have Lodgings two doors from your
Friend, our intention was to be at the the Barracks, but they were so
much out of repairs we could not, Lyons has had them fit up
went to the expence of painting our apartments and this day we
purpos'd taking possession, concluded ourselves station'd for the
Winter and thought we should be very comfortable as we've some

pleasant Society, and we could see our Darling Child occasionally,
judge our Disappointment on receiving a Letter from the Colonel
with orders for my Dear Lyons to be in readiness against the first
of Oct, to go to England for Recruits without saying what part or
any thing further, we're in the greatest trouble you can imagine,
if we wean our poor Boy and take him immediately to Sea there's
no saying what the consequence might be, with the additional
fatigue of Travelling one knows not how far by Land, and was
any thing to happen him we never could forgive ourselves, to
leave him with his Nurse among all Strangers the thought
seems unnatural tho' I do think that must be the plan, as
our stay is so uncertain we may be order'd back in a month
Lyons is just gone to Wexford to hear the particulars, I shall
be quite anxious till he returns, which will not be till
Tomorrow poor Fellow he's quite unhappy he feels so much for my
situation, which I think nothing at all about, if I'm only
with him all will be well, I've no fears.
I ought to apologize for finding no better entertainment for you
than my troubles, I know you possess a feeling Heart or I would

not enter so minutely into the subject, I'm convinc'd you'll forgive
me, for I can think of nothing else. If we go by Land to Dublin
you may depend we shall pay you a pass I could not be so
near without, I don't think we shall leave this till the middle
of the Week, may I request of you my Dear friend to write to
me by return of Post, I can only say you'll comfort me much
by so doing. How does the good old Lady and all your Brothers
Family will you remember
me kindly to them, and as
for your Husband I'll
venture to send my Love to him
Don't be Jealous now for mine
sent his to you. I will not trespass on your patience any longer
than to say Adieu and I subscribe myself
Your sincere Friend
H Lyons
