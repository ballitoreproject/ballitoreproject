Dear friend
I have thine of 3 mo. 11. with one inclosed
for Sarah Talbot - she was at the time out on a
religious visit but it [insertion]was[/insertion] pretty directly forwarded to her -
Neither of the young men mentioned in thine, have
yet made themselves known to me, when the do, any
service I can render them, shall be cheerfully done
I had heard of thy dear sister Sarah loosing
her sight - But the Lord's presence is able to make
up for all our losses & trials, hope it is her happy
experience - his presence is better than life &c - I have
met with many & heavy trials, in my outward
affairs, but ever blessed be the name of Israel's
Shepherd, he has not forsaken, & when we have an
evidence of this, that is enough - my dear love
to your family as if named, to Thos. Bewley & his &c:
and believe me dear Mary sincerely thine
As I live out of the city I would recommend letters for Sarah
Talbot to be directed to Samuel Smith C - Philada. -
