Suir Island 4th of 7th month 1791
My dear Grandfather
	I received thy very acceptable Letter some time ago, hope thou wilt excuse me for not answering it sooner.
I was glad to find that thou returned safe from England.
Uncle Robert arrived last fifth Day Evening.
All my Fathers Family are well, except Brother Robert who is but poorly.
Please tell my Brother Richard that I received his Letter, & intend to answer it soon.
I would be obliged to thee when thou sees my Aunt Chandlee, to give my dear Love to her, & tell her, I would be glad of a Letter from her. It would be very pleasing to me to see thee in Clonmel.
I already think it long since I had the Pleasure of seeing Brother Richard & hope he is better reconciled to the School than he was.
I have not much to say at present, so conclude with dear Love, in which I am joined by Jane Taylor, & Sister Sally to thee, Grandmother, Uncles, Aunts, Brothers & Cousins. Thy dutiful Grand-daughter
Anne Grubb.

PS/
Please send me the verse on Edith Lovell & Joseph Sparrow.
