Paris Hotel de Lille
August 14 1847
My dear Eliza
I received yr welcome letter
yesterday for which accept my best thanks
E.E. received one the day before from his father
and Johnny which told us of your all being
well at home, that added to the later
intelligence conveyed in yours has been a
great source of pleasure to us, as you may
judge from your own experience in such cause.
I am very glad yr party went off so well
I often thought of you [insertion]all[/insertion] on that day and hoped
the weather was as fine as with us. The
circumstance of the strange Dr and H Humphrey
meeting was a strange coincidence.
We intend leaving the strange place tomorrow
(Sunday) evening for Chalon & Lyons
as that is the route we have determined on
taking to Geneva, going the distance from Chalon
to Lyons by steam packet on the river Soane.
I believe that is the [unclear]name[/unclear]. Paris has far surpassed
my expectations in every way, without
doubt it is the most extraordinary city on
the face of the earth. We have seen a great
number of the sights, in fact we are almost
tired of them. I mean the inside of buildings
and pictures museums and so forth, but

as for the people and out door places
of amusement, he must be an epicure
indeed, who would not be gratified by
such a study, if I knew the Language
and could meet with the same fare
(I mean diet) as I get at home there is
no [deletion][/deletion] [insertion]city[/insertion] I would rather live [insertion]in[/insertion] provided
my people were here also. I have spent
the last two days in lounging about the
Gardens and Boulevards amused as
well as amusing others, if I may judge
from the manner in which numbers look
with admiration on me, whether it is
the eye glass or my not wearing a beard
or that I show some appearance of blood
in my face, [insertion](the french do not)[/insertion] I dont know which, but the
French stare more than I thought they
would particularly the young ladies.
Apropos of these same young ladies; I am
sadly disappointed [insertion]as to their beauty[/insertion] without any exaggeration
you would see more pretty girls
in one [underline]half[/underline] hour in the streets on London
or Dublin than you would here in an
entire week, although there are ten
times the number to be seen here such
as they are, both men and women
are extraordinarily plain, the men with
scarcely an exception wear beards and
so make themselves uglier than they
are by nature, at least [deletion][/deletion] [insertion]most[/insertion] of them,
and the women are pale sallow and
bilious looking, and although they do not
wear beards yet I have seen some
of them (oh tell it not in faith) with
very tolerable mustaches, their figures
are also bad both men and women being
much lower then we are, and no
wonder, for if I judge by myself they
must surely be half starved; none
of their soldiers (and heaven knows they
have enough of them any way) exceed
five feet two inches, on asking a French
man the reason of this, he said that
they were able to undergo greater fatigue
than taller men, but I firmly believe
they could not find sufficient men
for their immense army, if the standard
was higher. Your tightly made gowns
are quite gone out here, they are made
now to fit loose with plates, some of
them very like night gowns, but [deletion][/deletion]
look well and very interesting, they do not
wear bustles or much under clothing, the
weather being now extremely hot and
bonnets [deletion][/deletion] are the exception. The men's
trousers likewise are made very loose and
[unclear]fluted[/unclear] in the same way they were

about twenty years ago and nankeen is
all the fashion. It is useless my trying
to give [insertion]a[/insertion] description of their public buildings
and churches that we have [insertion]been[/insertion], they far
surpass any thing in London with the
exception of St Pauls and Westminster
Abbey. To give you some idea of the
extent of one of their [insertion]palaces[/insertion] (Versailles) we
arrived there at 12 o'clock, it closed at
four, during those four hours we walked
 at least [underline]four miles[/underline] [unclear]Irish[/unclear] through rooms
filled with pictures, and did not go
through the same room twice, nor did
we see all that was to be seen, then
the water works and gardens & park if
a person were to spend a week there
it would be insufficient to see them
properly. Some of their gardens and
places would look much better if there
was not such a quantity of guilding about
them, the lamp posts and points of
the railing being in many places guilt
which gives [deletion]it[/deletion][insertion]them[/insertion] too flimsy an appearance,
for this reason their finest view [unclear][/unclear] from
the Place de la Concorde does not look
so well as it otherwise would, and the
view of James Park in London just inside
the Horse Guards is in my oppinon finer [insertion]and more chaste[/insertion] although not
near so esteemed

I cut this sheet of paper thinking I Could
put the half of it in E.E.s Letter, but
he says he will fill a whole sheet, so
I must try and do the same. I have
plenty to tell if I had time & words
to do so. I never felt any thing like
the heat here, it is so oppressive that
we cannot stir in the slightest degree
without inconvenience, at the moment
I am sitting with my coat waistcoat &
neck handkerchief off still I am too warm,
it is with the greatest difficulty I can move
the pen along the paper, which circumstance
will I hope induce you to excuse
my bad writing. I am sure you would
pity us if you saw us the few first days
we were here walking along the hot
streets looking for some place to dine,
famishing with hunger & thirst, not
because there are no houses of entertainment,
for almost every second house is one, but
because the fare in most of them is most
unpalatable and the price most exhorbitant.
Now however we get on very well having
made out two or three where we get
a very tolerable dinner of a [insertion]very[/insertion] moderate rate,
for instance to day we had as much roast
beef as we could eat with potatoes and
kidney beans half a pint of wine one

bottle of beer (very weak) and one glass
of brandy for yr humble servant and
the cost for both of us was only
two franks and a half about 2s/1d.
To shew you the difference, at another
place we were charged one frank
each for a small cup of coffee without
any eatables, but you may be sure
we did not try that again.
On the night of our arrival a gentleman
[insertion]who[/insertion] was on the omnibus which carried
us from the Railway to our Hotel, hearing
E & me speaking, [deletion][/deletion] uttered the
word English in rather an interrogative
tone without saying anything else, E
whom [insertion][deletion][/deletion][/insertion] he addressed or appeared to do so,
after the [insertion]single[/insertion] word was spoken a second time
answered "oui Monsieur" after an interval
of five minutes, it entered into
my head that we should have followed
Thomas's advice and said we were
Irish, I told Ned so and he immediately
began in the best French
he could muster to explain to the
gentleman the mistake he had made
in saying we were English, as soon
as he had nearly finished to his
satisfaction, the gentleman said
in a broad Scotch accent "I dinna
understand French" upon which we
immediately entered into a conversation
in the vernacular, from which
we found that this was his first
visit to Paris and that he was going
to the same Hotel as ourselves,
we have since kept up a kind
of an acquaintance and have seen
some of the sights together, both he
and ourselves regret that we did not
see all in company as we could
each of us have saved considerably
by so doing, but neither party wished
to intrude on the other. It is a
great pity we natives of Gr Britain
are so stand off. I am now nearly at
the end of my paper and as I do not
expect to sleep much tomorrow night
think it better to make the most of this by
going to bed early [deletion][/deletion]
[deletion][/deletion] Hoping that it may find you
all well I will conclude by subscribing
myself your affectionate Brother Arthur
Please give my to Lucy and the children
also my Mother & Manliff. Tell Thomas that
I will endeavour to take his advice, and
that I think the [unclear]adjective[/unclear] accompanying
here is rather [unclear]too complimentary[/unclear], also

that I find the pockets of the greatest use
Give my love to Richard Elizabeth & Florence
In reading over this letter I fear you will find it rather
incoherent, but it has been written in a great hurry
and I am sure you will look upon its faults with
indulgence, coming as it does from yr affectionate
AB
If you write to Lucerne any time before a week from this date
or to Berne a few days after we hope to receive yr letter without
fail, afterwards to Basle directing to poste restante in all cases.
