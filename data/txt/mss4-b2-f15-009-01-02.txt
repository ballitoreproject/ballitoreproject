                                                                C Dale 17th of 8th month 1789


        Such is the value I set on thy friendship and Fatherly notice, my Beloved Friend - that I cannot easily omit enquiring after thy own & Valuable familys welfare - rather expecting to have heard from Ballitore before this time - as thou proposed writing me on thy return home - but have by no means imparted[?] your silence to a want of sympathy or remembrance under my present close affliction, which remains much as when favourd with a short yet memorable opportunity of thy Company. My Beloved Husband is still under our own Roofe - but the nature of the complaint gives us little reason to hope for a perfect restoration - while continued there - but we intend trying it a little longer, as the necessity of a temporary separation will greatly encrease [sic] our sorrows - thou may suppose home has been my constant allotment since thy leaving us - except attending meetings for Discipline - as they have fallen in course which I have hithertoo [sic] been strengthened to do - one of which was in North Wales. I provd a Season to be thankfully remembred - but in general my mind has been to my own feelings much devested [sic] of the Presence of Him - that causes the solitary in familys to rejoice - & yet I have some reason to hope - the Everlasting Arm has been underneath - or I must have sunk under the pressure of deep conflicts, but I am often afraid of not keeping enough under the proving dispensation[?] - & thereby let it pass over without being sufficiently instructed, as afflictions arise not out of the Dust, neither doth trouble spring out of the Ground - but in all the Lords dealings with his Children he intendeth their refinement 
        I was glad of an account of thy own & Beloved Lydia & Sallys welfare by a letter from [illegible name] Mills with other interesting intelligence for amidst all my own cares, the Cause of Truth will I hope remain Dear - it was brave Dear Tavenor could accompany our H [?] to Clonmell miracles seems yet to be wrought in the Churches  & the Great Lord of the Harvest is calling in labourers into his Vineyard - may they all keep to the Root of Life - that so there may be the Pomegranet [sic] ever accompaning the Bell  which will cause the Fathers & Mothers in Israel to rejoice. 
        I have often thy Dear Wife in remembrance as one of these - I crave her prayers for my steady standing that [illegible] there may be a persevering to the end - her kind attention to me has often afforded me encouragment 
did thy enampleary Son AS. [?] get a letter from me in 3rd month last I know it did not merit a reply - I only wish to know if he got it that I may not appear ungrateful for his valuable communication - please to make my Endeard Love acceptable to his whole family 
        Thou will no doubt have heard of the recent loss the Churches have sustaind in the removal of our valuable Friend Cousin Williamm Rathbone, Susannah Boone of Birmingham is also Dead of a Fever - & leaves is much lamented - as a Pillar removd  my Beloved R[?] Young giving some account of herself - I need say little about her - but that her Company is a comfort to me - of which I have been long deprived 
Our Valuable Friend A Summerland is finely & would join in much Love did she know of my writing - but she is on a visit of friendship at Worcester 
        Our family is in usual health & write in dear Love to each branch of thy family with thy Affectionate Friend
                        Deborah Darby
