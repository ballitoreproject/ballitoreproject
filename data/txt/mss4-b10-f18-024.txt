Lamlash Harbour
Island of Arran July 28th 56
My dear Mamma
Though they have
not yet thrown down
our anchor I hasten
to write this on chance
of a post either to-night
or in morning, to tell
you Alls Well, & I hope
& trust we may hear

the same from you
we now consider our
faces turned towards
home, we parted with
Mr Gowan today
as he does not intend
going towards home
yet, we met him
again, the day after
I wrote last - I will
keep all I have to tell
untill we meet, it is
not always pleasant
(at least to me) to write
when sailing - dear
love to Lucy & all
ever your much attached
MJB -
P.S. I believe we will stay
a day or two here for
Ricd to see the mountains
