Carlow: Sixth-day.
My dear Wm..
I intend going to-morrow morning with John &
Nancy Grubb in a cab to their Uncle Jo Malone's, where I
suppose we will dine, & we wish if convenient thou could
meet us there. Dear Nancy comes like what she is, a true
friend: she is to lodge with us. I wish Fanny would put the
bed she lies on, on the bed-stead in the little room inside Hannah's,
there is a pair of sheets in the lower drawer of the tall-boy
in that room: the other things I can get when I return I expect.
She only stays a few days I believe. Mother is better for her
journey I think, I have been poorly yesterday with my head &
stomach & dazzling in my eyes, worse than I have had of late.
am finely this evening, but was disappointed at not meeting
thee. Our wounds have been opened this day, & many of us
wept together I believe. It seems to me a stroke I never
shall recover, but I have still dear connections, & thee the
dearest of all. Nancy Grubb's dear love to thee
thine entirely
