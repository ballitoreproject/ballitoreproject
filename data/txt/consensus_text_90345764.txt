12 Saturday - Papa went to town but Charlie
staid out which was a very uncommon
saying that Polly was thinking of coming
up on Seventh [underline]this[/underline] day, which [deletion]took[/deletion]
gave a [underline]very[/underline] [underline]very[/underline] pleasant surprise
as I did not expect her until some
day next week. Well out came Papa
by the five Â½ train but no Polly or
Thomas - he had left Philip behind him
in town and asked him to go meet
them and bring them out by the eight
O'clock train - He told us of the
death of poor Charlie Bewley - he died
yesterday at about two O'clock - had
just come in from a little airing
he was taking in a bath chair and
was resting on the sofa - his Father
asked him would he like to put his
feet up - he said he was able to do that
himself - there [deletion]he[/deletion] were some strawberries
on the table, he took a fancy to them,
and I believe eat some - then laid his
head on his hand and soon after
his spirit quietly passed away -
event. - Had a note from Margt
[underline]June[/underline] -
