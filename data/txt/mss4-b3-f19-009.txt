Waterford: 23rd/11 month 1780


My dear Uncle


        I long very much for the pleasure of hearing from you how you go on at Ballitore: & since I have been already favoured with thy pleasing, instructive letters, request I may still be allowed to indulge the hopes of more when it suits thy convenience. I wrote three letters within these three weeks to Molly, to thee & Sally which hope you received, that I might not appear negligent & undeserving of a continuance of my Friends [sic] favours. I should be glad to learn that no indisposition was the occasion of my having no reply. Archibald has been but poorly since his return but I think in general no worse except for two days he was confined to the house. This evening were interred the remains of George Randals [sic] wife whose death was very sudden: last seventh-day as she stooped planting something in her garden she fell down in a fit & expired in a few hours. James Hasty is returned from England the only person who had spirit to see the Friend Betty Gregory to her native country where he left her pretty well: thy had an agreeable passage. I ought to be ashamed to send thee such a scrap of a letter as indeed I really am but as it is the best my dull brains can at present afford hope it will be thought better of than a longer delay of writing. I hope to hear Debby enjoys a great deal of happiness in Athy I beg my dear love may be presented to her & Tommy, my Aunt, the girls & all the family
        I am dear Uncle
                thy dutiful Nephew
                        William Rayner
