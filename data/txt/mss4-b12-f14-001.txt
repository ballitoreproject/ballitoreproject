How gratifying, once more,
to receive a letter from my
dearly esteemed "Di" - next to
her own dear self, most welcome
indeed. On Wednesday
morning when seated at Breakfast
I was expressing my great
disappointment to Martha at
not having had the good fortune
to meet you, and we so near
each other, when the servant
entered and laid a letter on
the table directed in Your

well-remembered hand-writing
to "Me." - what reminiscing and
feelings it at once called forth,
& how thankful & flattered I
felt. I would have written
in reply ere this, but that
I had been on the move ever
since, until yesterday, when
I arrived here. Our dear
Martha told me she expected
you again sometime in January -
if so, please God, I may
have the happiness of seeing
you, for I shall make an effort
to do so. We cannot, as you
justly remark, at this period
of our lives expect to have
many more meetings. You
allude to your beloved Father
- yes, dear Eliza, I respected &
esteemed him as much as
anyone out of his immediate
family could do. I frequently,
in thinking over former happy
& youthful days, picture him
when sitting at the head of
his table either in Britain St.
or at the Glen, his benevolent
countenance and cheerful disposition
and good-nature causing
everybody around him to feel

pleased and delighted. - After
Breakfast Martha & I went
to see your Mother - she was
looking very well, & was very
glad to see me - of course, we
chatted about old times - the
day was beautifully fine, & we
did not wish her to lose her
drive, so we had, in fact, to
force her out. We then went
over the dear Glen in all directions,
& you may be sure
you frequently became the theme
of our conversation - so much
so, that if there be any truth
in the old sayings, your ears
ought to have been very hot.
