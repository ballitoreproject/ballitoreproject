Stranmore 29th of 5th mo 1779
I received my dear Cousin Molly's kind letter which was very acceptable,
as every from her is to me, the affectionate assurance of they sympathetick
feelings is very agreeable: how happy are we in having so many kind
friends, both at home & at a distance from us, who endeavour by every means
in their power to alleviate our distress.
We were much rejoiced to see thy dear Father & Mother here, their
company was exceedingly agreeable, I am sorry we have had so little of it,
they left this before breakfast last third day, my Grandfather attended
them to Lurgan, & my unkle Jimmy from that to Lisburn, where they
dined, he brought account [insertion]that[/insertion] they were pretty well. Friends have seem
to have good unity with Sarah Newland, I think she is a very honest
agreeable woman. Thy Father received a letter from thee this day
week, accompanying thy beautiful verses on thy brothers wedding, he
was so kind as to leave them with me that day as I did not go to the
meeting, I think they are well worthy to have been the production
of thy pen, by the account I have had of thy amiable sister Lydia
thou has dilineated her in very just colours, I have not ever had
the pleasure of being much in her company, but hope I shall some
time

time or other be so happy as to have an acquaintance with her.
There is not much alteration in poor John since you heard last
from us, except that he seems to grow weaker, [deletion]his[/deletion] rests worse than he
did & his stomach & Belly are much swelled & hard. There appears
very little probability of his recovery now, tho' Providence can if he sees
meet raise him up from the brink of the grave; the removal of so promising
a boy will be indeed a bitter cup, but He can sweeten it if
it be his holy will. I trust none of his friends would murmur at
being taken away, but bear the trial with resignation.
Sally Nicholson is a good deal better at present, we were
in hopes she was recovering, but Doctor Law was to see a few days ago
& he says he is much afraid she will have a relapse before the year
is at an end, she talks of going to Dublin soon & taking Ruthy
with her, the Physician who attends Ruth thinks her disorder lies
principally in her liver, Doctor Law thinks her lungs are not at all
sound, I fear the unwholsome air of the City will be very prejudicial
to them both, but I suppose they will take lodgings in
the country near Dublin if they find very bad effects from it.
We had the agreeable company of [unclear]Becey Grub[/unclear] & Molly

Greer yesterday, we expect to see the former & her Mother [insertion]to see us[/insertion] tomorrow,
they have been in Lurgan since fifth day, and I believe
are to proceed home the beginning of next week.
We have some expectation of cousin Tommy Chandler today
& cousin Sam if [insertion]he[/insertion] accompany's him.
My cousin Nancy Murphy has got a young daughter
last fifth day morning & when the account came was as well as
could be expected. Adieu in haste my dear & believe me with
every sentiment of affection.
I need not tell thee how
thy very sincere friend & Cousin
much pleasure a letter from thee
Margaret Christy
wld give me.
My Mother & John join me in dear love to all our Friends at
Ballitore

we were
few days ago
