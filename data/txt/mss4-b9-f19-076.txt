5th mo: 1824
My dear E - I have a commission for thee
which I hope will not prove too troublesome
Edw wishes to get 2 boys able to work who
would wish to earn their head & to live
in the house with us they should be respectable
boys - perhaps some of the poor friends in
the North would wish for a place for their
[unclear] sons [/unclear] - has Jane Le Batt a son out of place?
or would he be desirable? all this
is to thy self as thou knows the less fuss
there would be made about it the better
they would have a good deal to do & should
be strong & willing to work we would
take as good care of them as we could

this morning brought us a letter from you
oh perhaps my mother would come [deletion]with[/deletion]
Jas F I am glad you have got Sally
& hope to have her here before she returns
to Limerick tell her she owes Edw a visit
I am glad to hear my father's leg is
so much better do not fret thyself
about the boy's
E. Leadbetter
