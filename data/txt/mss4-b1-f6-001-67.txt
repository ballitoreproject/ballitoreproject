Birmingham August 12th 1785
My Dear Sir
I was greatly mortify'd at not finding you in London, on
my arrival there some time since; I heard of you, & you had but
just departed; my regt. is daily expected to land from the West Indies
& our Quarters fix'd for Gloucester; on my road from whence, I travell'd
as far as Worcester, with a [underline]friend[/underline], (Mr. Thos. Beasly) who I got very
great with, owing to my being an acquaintance, & old pupil of
yours, he told [insertion]me[/insertion] of yr. excursions, which were novel to Sally, as I understood
at Ballitore, was yr. companion; I hope she was pleasd with
her tour thro' this vast kingdom, & your neither [insertion]of you[/insertion] the worse of
your jaunt, I am here on the recruiting Service, which is both
disagreeable & expensive, the people here, are all over head & ears
in business, I know nobody, & am likely to continue so, there genious
& disposition, differ so much from mine, & what I have been us'd to, that
I am like a fish out of water; I almost wish for the West Indies again
tho [underline]hot[/underline] a place as I formerly describd it to be; you see wee mortals are
never content; I waited on Admiral Hugh's some time ago in London, concerning
the pretentions our late brother had to prize money, he receivd
me politely, & passed a number of encomiums on poor Sam, the story
he told me was exactly such as you alreddy know; the sum taken
was four hundred thousand pounds ([insertion]or[/insertion] 40 Sack of rupees) its not denied by Mr.
Hastings or the India Company; its now in Doctors Commons, & Sr Edward
is determined to prosecute the business with spirit; & if cast in that
[unclear]court[/unclear] to bring it before the Kind & Counsil, what ever is recoverd the
sixteenth part, comes to Bob & I; I place no sort of dependance on it
if it comes, We shall be lucky dogs; if not, we are, just as we were
