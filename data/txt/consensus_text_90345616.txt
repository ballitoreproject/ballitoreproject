January 1st.. [underline]Blarney[/underline]
time last year that I would now
be here - oh where shall I be and
what will happen this coming
year - We went to Cork to meeting
intending after it to go to see
the Roberts, but seeing Sam Roberts
we altered our intention and
after transacting some shopping
business we drove out and were
in good time for dinner. The
morning was rainy now and
then, still it held up pretty well. -
After dinner we took another walk
then letters and so passed the evening
After tea we had or rather I had
some conversation with (-) and then
up to our room - Miss Cade joined
us for awhile - and afterwards
I went down to see what they
were doing below - found them
dancing in the drawing Room
so Miss Cade and I staid awhile
in the drawing room which we had
1857 -
Little did I think this
