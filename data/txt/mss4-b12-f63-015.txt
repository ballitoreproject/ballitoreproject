I believe [deletion]my[/deletion] the letter which I addressed
to thee some time ago reache
thee at an unfavourable juncture
when thy mind was agitated by the
loss of a beloved relative, & therefore thou
may have forgot it. But I hope thou will ex-cuse
the liberty I take of again addressing
thee on a subject which is of consequence
to me, namely the dividing of a sum of
money that thou expected would have been
in thy power to pay, & was due to my father
from the late Thomas Wily. Thou desired
that my husband & I should give [deletion]up[/deletion] to
thee the liberty to act as thou thought
proper in the business which we did at
that time, but have not heard since any
[unclear][/unclear]

thou concerning it, except from Thos Abbott
who thinks he could recover the debts if
the creditors would join him in steps [unclear]pr[/unclear]
so doing & bear him harmless as to the expense
my husband
this we were willig to do on our part
& we think it a pity that the other
creditors shd not join in with their
proposal & let the business be brought to a
conclusion. If thou hast declined
acting any further in the business we
would think it prudent to withdraw
the liberty we gave thee to act for us
