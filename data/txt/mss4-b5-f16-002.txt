Dear Cousin Molly,
Tottenham 2 mo 6th 1778
I find it far more difficult to write when
called upon than to pay Money, if I have it, this indeed I
never with-hold where due, but let it go at least as freely as it
comes, unless I happen to be deceived with base Metal, which,
when discovered I destroy though not of my own coming, choosing
to suffer for my own Negligence, rather than repeat the Fraud to
the loss of the Ignorant or may be of such as are less able to
bear it; This I believe Justice requires, but were I so nice in
the Discharge of my epistolary Debts or my Friends to reject all
but pure Sterling, I should [insertion]be[/insertion] reduced to [insertion]the necessities of [/insertion]making a very small composition
or my Correspondence must cease like Trade without [deletion]Ret[/deletion]
Returns; hence thou, as a principal Creditor, mayest expect to
come but indifferently off either in Quantity or Quality, if not in
both; my Fund is very low & by the receipt of thy last Favour
I find myself doubly indebted, the Packet that miscarried being
equally at my risque; to send duplicates is a common & good Precaution,
specially if the Voyage be hazardous or the [unclear]Bottom[/unclear] suspected
crazy; had some of us been aware of so valuable a Charge,
shipped for us, or intended to be, we should not have begrudged a handsome
Premium for Insurance, if possible, against every Risque whether
there on Land or Water; those sad Americans alarmed our Courts about
the Time, but I feel these letters fell into Hands less generous than
theirs. - We esteem the repeated particular Accounts of your Family
as real Favours, [deletion][/deletion] the more circumstantial they are [insertion][unclear][/unclear][/insertion] the more agreeable,
we being interested in the Peace & Welfare of you all, as Indeed
we ought, Gratitude demands & I trust Affection insures it; for my
part I shall long retain a warm Side towards the whole Village, it
was a pleasant Spot to me; & to [unclear]my house[/unclear] no less; it grieves us to
hear of its being so dismantled. Those Trees were both an ornament
& shelter; their Removal might perhaps improve the Prospect
from the school but to have this again obstructed by a parcel of unseemly
Cabins must be very provoking - When I wrote to thy
Father I had not seen the Appointment for a General Post &
Deprecation - to be strictly observed in Scotland the 26th instant in
England the 27th These are the Last become first & the First Last.--
Last in Rebellion, first in Loyalty, in Government, in Fasting & Prayer
Prayer

Prayer for Success in this righteous & necessary War, necessary
[double line]
to the Being, & well-being of every gude Cheild in Place, & that would be
in, which, from their continued flocking hither. might seem to be every
Mothers' Son beyond the Tweed; but what will be done when we can
hold no more, & have not made America ready to receive the [insertion]surplus[/insertion]? - If
their Friends at this Court cannot provide for them they must apply to
that; it will only be changing Sides, not Principles, or returning
rather to their Brethren & natural Allies the present Rulers there
one in Faith & Practice; in Government, Religion, & Persecution, Oliverism
all. I am persuaded they will reunite & soon, if America succeed
in her favourite Scheme; that of erecting an independent Common-wealth.
But, alas what then will become of our poor Friends, for
there the Presbyterian spirit is most intolerant & cruel! I think better
would they have been, in my opinion, [insertion]subject[/insertion] [deletion]and[/deletion] to the control of an [underline]English[/underline]
Parliament, could the Scotch have been excluded. -- Should not
[underline]Te Deum[/underline] also be sung on the safe arrival of the Puissant General
Burgoin? Part of his Baggage & Followers, Bag-pipes & Macs I suppose
are already come; may the Horses & all theirs be favoured to return in the
same peaceable manner [insertion]without further Bloodshed[/insertion] say I - Politics these fit for Friends, if any be -
but enough of this; I had no view to the Subject when I sat down to write
to thee, not but that I think my Cousin Molly possessed of Feelings sufficient
[insertion]tenderly[/insertion] to interest her in the general Weal.
Robert Walker is come up & the other Friends on the Visit to this Quarte
William Rathbone excepted, I fear the North has not given up, yet I
wish to be charitable, thy worthy Father & Samuel Neale have been looked
for [deletion]but[/deletion] perhaps the Call did not reach so far - Richard Reynolds of
Colebrookdale & Jeremiah Waring have joined them. Esther Marshall of
Leeds is come up on a Visit to these Southern Counties & with a view to
some Families of London. We are expecting Elizabeth Robinson shortly
to become a Resient near us, one George Gibson a Widower of a Saffron Walden
in Essex, of good Report, is said to make Suet successfully at Holly House.
but Report is apt to be besides the Mark, as well as fore & aft, in these
Matters, yet in a good Ropert we may hope there is some truth.
Having inclosed more or less in each of my other Letters to enhance [deletion]their[/deletion]
[deletion]value[/deletion] or rather to give them a value, for the same Reason I may not
close this without, desiring they may be acceptable if but for their
contents, though sensible of your kind partiality to the author.
Thy very affectionate Friend & Cousin
Birkbeck

By next new year's day
You're desired to say.
What are M&Ks. neat houses, *
Where they live without spouses,
Where never a Joan has her John?
Now methinks says each maid,
With a toss of her head,
"Then I'm sure I will never rent one."

my Son is transcribing from a Letter
