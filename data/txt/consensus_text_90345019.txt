9[underline]th[/underline]. Another very gloomy morning,
Polly in, we did not go
out, at about one the
carriage came in
but no Polly in it, as she
and Florence (who had
paid a visit with Uncle
R and Aunt E to Fassaroe
yesterday evening, and
who had staid the
night with Polly) had
gone to the exhibition
where Polly wrote me
word to meet them
so, J & I got ourselves
ready as quickly as
possible, intending
to go on from that
to spend the day with
as we were expecting
