We had a hope he might have come up with us eer we got to Darwent
with the chair, which he kindly took charge of through the
bad, bad, roads, to bring to us: but he did not come up to us there,
so we still expected he was before us. After taking some refreshment
we again mounted, & rode about 6 miles to Shotley-bridge
a small town & agreeable inn: - here we were frightened at not
meeting Joseph & the chair, & our anxiety encreased on his not
arriving before bed-time: part of the night was trying, immagination
was busy, & dear S:T was not the least sufferer amongst
us: however before we went to meeting, on the 8th.., we were, I
believe I may say, [underline]thank[/underline]ful, to see him driving up to the inn
he had had a suffering time of it since we parted at his door
for having an unpleasant moore to cross, & a thick fog rising, he
quite lost his way, & rov'd about, wet & weary, till about 4 o'clock
in the afternoon. We all went to meeting, which to me was a
very precious meeting indeed: oh how delightful to feel good
