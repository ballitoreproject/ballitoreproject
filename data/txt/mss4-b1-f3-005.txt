P.7	“Keep thy mind as quiet as possible, so that thou mayst have benefit of this little tour. I desire thou mayst have thy eye to Him that hath preserved, in some degree, him that writeth, and is his chiefest joy. Next to that, my joy is that mine may walk acceptably before Him. Durable riches, I know, and honours, are in his right-hand, which He dispenses impartially, in his own fit time.”
