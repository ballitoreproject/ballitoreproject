his conduct to me has been such as deserves neither favor
affection, I advance'd very considerable sums of money for him
in order to equip him when going out to Canada last
year, the recollection of which, I thought, and did expect to
alter his manners, but to the astonishment of all (except
myself) it has not, and sorry am I to inform you that a [unclear]Man[/unclear]
a worse heart, I believe does not exist - if ingratitude is
a crime; God forgive him, for he has a weight of it to [unclear]answer[/unclear]
for. My advice to you is by all means to try the [unclear][/unclear]
of records, & see whether there is any bond debt & [unclear]judgment[/unclear]
against him of a prior or subsequent date to [unclear]that[/unclear] [unclear][/unclear]
yours, and being satisfy'd on that head, the expediency of
entering judgment I leave to your better understanding
- it will be to be sure advancing so much ready [unclear]money[/unclear]
out of which you must lay untill the bond is paid, [unclear]when[/unclear]
sooner or later it must be there being sufficient in [unclear][/unclear]
to answer a much larger demand, but distant [unclear][/unclear]
tho' sure is not what seems to suit your wishes [unclear]then[/unclear]
I shou'd think your best way wou'd be to see & dispose
your interest in the bond, [insertion]that[/insertion] you will not get its its[unclear][/unclear]
is very certain - Mr Ruxton who receives our [unclear]rent[/unclear]
& which goes to the discharge of our Lawsuit, might
probably become the purchaser of it; It is not every
wou'd buy a debt, where the security is so remote
