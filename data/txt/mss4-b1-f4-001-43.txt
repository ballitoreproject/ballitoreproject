An adept in Latin knows, as it were by intuition, the powers
and fitness of words derived from that fountain, and uses
them accordingly; he has opportunity of reading historians,
moralists, poets, and orators, in a language which no translation
does any thing like justice to: translations, compared
with such originals, are like shadows compared with substances,
and like un-animated, compared with animated nature.
Do let Abraham learn Latin immediately: he may go on
with his French at the same time. The store of learning is
no burden. There are many changes in life: He may possibly
be put to his shifts in future life, and be glad to get his bread
by his wits, like his Grandfather. When stripped of all,
the Latin Scholar can say: "Omnia mea mecum porto." ***
I hope that my firstborn grandson will be permitted to
cultivate that literary knowledge, which when kept in due
subordination, is an useful ornament in society.
