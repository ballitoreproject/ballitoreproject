4/8/21
after seeing beggars and Mountains together you saw & Felt
a specimen of Mountain Rain, You then saw presence of mind
exhibited, in the Saving of some of your friends from a ditch, then
you came, to that ever to be remembered oddity of womankind, Judy,
who gave you consola- spir- &c. &c. after going on you at last saw
the Sea, Brayhead, Sugar loaf, Killiney, Waterford, Three Rocks,
[unclear]Corragolgan[/unclear], and Powerscourt, next came Bray, [unclear]Tulla[/unclear],
and last not least Glendruid, that land for Memory
to rest on with delightful recollections, of former days. So
having brought you home I must mention one thing you saw,
which you will say I have forgot, that is Wolf's Crag.
So far I had in my head to write before I got your letters
I cannot announce to you the arrival of the Dublin
[unclear]Splasarme[/unclear], my father thinks it better I should put off
[unclear][/unclear]ing, untill I would see whether I would be wanting
[unclear][/unclear] for Lucy or not so that I cannot have the pleasure
 of taking spir - or consola - in Ballitore for some
time longer I congratulate you on your dreams,
but for my part I never once dreamed about it, for it
seems to me all like a dream that happened some
time ago, not quite a month off.
S F & E M are gone to Edenderry, where they arrived
without any adventure I went to see Mrs F last night, she
was working away as busy as a bee.
I did not go out that Sunday morning 'till after meeting.
They are very badly off at Glendruid for someone to walk with
them & not having time to go out to them till yesterday to
stay the day with them
Yrs John
PS. If you would rather climb a hill of dif-
than get through this long paper you may
go to Lug [unclear][/unclear]
