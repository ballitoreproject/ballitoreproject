My dear cousins,


        Understanding that ye were both together, and an opportunity offering to Mountmelick, I embrace it to salute you with mine & my wifes dear love, a three-fold cord which I trust will not be quickly broken, as it is intwisted with natural kindred, social friendship & spiritual union. We rejoiced, my dear cousins, in that we are persuaded that our common, most gracious Benefactor hath taken you up, even when as exposed infants, hath reared you, and led you, and fed you until this hour: so that instead of being immersed in obscure darkness and pollution, your lights shine round about you  instead of being cause of sorrow & shame to your near connexions, we extract satisfaction & delight from our relation to youand instead of forfeiting your privileges with respect to religious society, or being branded with censure by it, ye have been preserved in the precious unity of the body, and are locked up to as the hopes of ornament and help in the Church. Now what will ye render, my beloved children, in return for all these benefits?Why, give up your all, body, soul and spirit, as a whole burnt-offering, with unreserved dedication  There are too many partial sacrifices  Remember [page number] 364 ye what our Lord said to the rich young man, If thou will be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, & thou shalt have treasure in heave: and come & follow me: And I believe, my dear cousins, that it is your sincere desire that ye may be enabled & qualified so to do  I believe your eyes have been mercifully opened to see a glimpse of the transcendent beauty and excellence, which is in the Truth  may the cares and disquietudes of this life never be permitted to close or dim them  nor the stealing torpor of indifference and lukewarmness cause them to sleep the sleep of death! But use all diligence to stir up the gift which is in you, for, saith the apostle, God hath not given us the spirit of fear, but of power, & of love, & of a sound mind  Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel, according to the power of God.
        ++ I returned 18th instant from an excursion to Wicklow & County Wexford, and had cause of satisfaction in my progress. I think it is a choice thing to get into a good service. The great and good Master keeps a noble house and a plentiful table  no honest, faithful, diligent servant of his will want meat in due season  he feeds & clothes, & supplies with every necessary  he also instructs & gives skill to his servants how to behave themselves in his house, that there may [pencil insertion] ^be^ no disorder, nor confusion, no clashing, nor mistaking; but good order & harmonious labour. +++
        I am, my dear Cousins, very affectionately yours [sic]
                Richard Shackleton
