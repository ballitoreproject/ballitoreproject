Ballitore: 8th of 6th month 1760.

Dear Friend,

	+++ How agreeable it is to hear of a messenger of glad tidings being sent among us! It seems as it were to make the seed rejoice with a fresh salutation. Yet I dare not look much before hand with the expectancy of benefit or comfort from them having had my expectations of that sort considerably disappointed. I find in my little experience that the Lord & Master will be looked to, & that with diligent heed, or our feet will be apt to slide. May day with ^unto^ day utter speech, the transactions of one day serve as lessons to the following one, that so we may husband well & improve our time, which some of us have lost too much of, or spent to little purpose, our or else our situation as to the best interest & service would be otherwise at this day, than it isto the abasement & abhorrence of self be it spoken, & in due time may it be published to the praise of a gracious & long suffering Providence. +++
	I am now & often
		thy well-wishing friend
			Richard Shackleton
