My dear Eliza
The letter I got this morning has
altered my intention of going home as soon as
I said. Elizth. did get my Mothers message
about coming home with me, and I gave her
thy message too, she would like it of all [unclear]things[/unclear]
and [unclear][/unclear] Betsey has no objection to her [unclear][/unclear]ing
so, but this week she cannot, I therefore
told her I thought my Mother would have
no objection to my waiting untill the latter
end of this or the beginning of next. if she
would then accompany me, and likewise
Cousin Betsy desires me to say she hopes [underline]thou[/underline]
wilt return with C and pay thy visit to her,
which I hope thou wilt however consider it,
Cousin B will be quite disappointed if thou
does not come, she often speaks of it. The Pooles
are here still, they go away on fourth day I
believe; they are not satisfied here that I
should go [insertion]soon[/insertion], they say I did not pay them
half my visit, so that if I do stay as long as I said
that will satisfy them I expect. if what I said
does not meet with my Mother's approval thou
mayst write and tell me. Eben & Ellen S were here to
day they wanted me to go and spend a week with them
and Ellen told me as an inducement that she would give
me a ride on horseback, but I told them I could not as I
would soon leave this. If I hear nothing to the contrary
I may conclude that what I have written is agreeable, and
I will write to let you know the day we intend going.
I expect nothing may happen to prevent Elizath. from coming
with me I know it would gratify her greatly. It is very
pleasant to hear you are all well, and that poor Manliff
is getting on tho' it is but slowly. give my dear love to all
and joined with Betsy B & E's love
 believe me thy affecte. Sister
Selina
