Killitra, near Mallin
19th December 1813
My dear Mrs. Leadbeater
Tho it is so many
Years since I had the pleasure
of seeing, or hearing from you,
I trust I am not [underline]quite[/underline] erased
from your recollection, and if
not, I am vain enough to flatter
myself you will not only excuse
my hustling you on the present
trifling occasion, but will have
no objection to oblige so old a
friend: Several years since, our
friend Thos. Chandlee on his
leaving Athy informed me he
handed me some trifling articles
of

of mine to your care. I am
sure what they are I can not
[underline]now[/underline] say, but believe among
them there are some fishing
Rods, as these were made by
an old Sportsman of mine who
is long since dead, and I cannot
[underline]now[/underline] for Money get such,
may I request you will be so
good as to inform [insertion]me[/insertion] are they in
being, safe, &c as I cant' express
to you what I shou'd give to
get them: I am here settled
with the same family you
knew in Athy, with the addition of
5 Children more, so that I have
3 Girls and three Boys, the latter
the

the very finest fellows (without
too much vanity) I am behold
in [underline]our [/underline]family; Mrs. Palmer, And
Mrs.[unclear] Davis [/unclear] desire to be most
kindly remember'd to you: I beg
my sincere regards to your
Husband, and ought the same,
My dear Mrs Leadbeater,
from your truly affect. friend,
Sandford Palmer
