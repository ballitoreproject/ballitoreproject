I received thy last very acceptable letter,
my beloved sister Peggy, by Ben Wilson, & by
him again I mean to make some sort of reply.
I feel thy tenderness of me, & the spirit of allowance
which thou breathes. - Oh my dear! I
believe I erred, in not humbly & quietly receiving
the portion permitted, yea, tho' bitter as death, -
- but I ought surely to tell thee, (as I told thee
what I make no doubt caused thee pain on
my account,) to comfort thee, that I hope I
do feel forgiveness, which indeed I count
as the greatest blessing, & one that I durst not
have looked for, let-a-lone expect. I now feel
poor & empty beyond description, - yet quiet,
& sometimes a sweet feel of resignation: - &
this day in meeting (14th) I thought I could
breathe to our father's God, & petition, that
if consistant with His will I might never
more be filled, but with His fullness. Yet
indeed it does seem to me astonishing, that
so poor [insertion]an[/insertion] ignorant weak creature should ever
be thought worthy to make mention of the
Lord's name. I got the letter, to my comfort,
thou mentions having written before thy last.
1792?

I long to behold thy face, & yet I almost dread
it. I suppose thou wilt hardly get to Dublin?
Well maybe Thomas may be weaned against
our Qly. meeting in Carlow. We wish to hear
of thy being quite recovered, - as also dear brother
Saml., I have a shirt & stockings of his,
hoping he will wear them [underline]here[/underline] after a while.
We have been uneasy about sister Chandlee,
- she got better, but we hear is again poorly.
My mother bore her journey finely, & we hoped
was better for it. She is at present very
weakly, tho' does not appear worse than this
some time back: she took a vomit last evening
which seemed hard & trying to her:
she does not propose venturing to Dublin, -
nor does Mary intend going I find, saying
both she & Wm. can well be from home together,
& she prefers letting him go: - their little
Elizabeth enjoys uninterrupted health I think,
& is very engaging. Abraham is at present I
believe in Mt.mellick, attending the funeral of
our beloved Nancy Gatchell: - the vomiting of
blood soon put an end to her sweet innocent
life: â€“ dear John is exceedingly to be pittied. With
dear love to brother & the children, I remain my
precious sister Margaret's
Thy Richd. well I believe.
