Dublin the 2nd of the 11th mo 1776
My dear Molly's Letter came duly
to hand, and I have taken up my pen this morning to
answer it but I met with so many interruptions that
I fear it will be but a poor attempt however I expect thou
will take the will for the deed as / you know what it is to
have a hurry of company sometimes
I received my dear Friends Letter by Bob Backster I
was glad to see the Bearer but was sorry when he told me he
had left Balletore he spoke of leaving you with great regret
he says he never intends to take so much delight again
in any place where he is not to spend the remainder of his
days, he did not seem much tired he dined with no one day
after. I got a strict charge from him to give his dear love
to your family and a double share was to be given to thee
thou must not have made the least apology about the
profile I will get it done with the greatest pleasure, indeed
I have neglected it yet but intend sending it to the young
Man presently [insertion]to be ordered[/insertion] and if I can to inclose it in this Letter if not

thou may be shore that proper care will be taken of it untill
I can get a nother opportunity.
Thy Mother and Father had a wet day yesterday to travel
but I think they did not get rold, a great many [unclear]friends[/unclear]
is come to the Meeting, the agreeable Sally Robbinson and
her sister is to come she is as pleasing as our Fanny Wily is
to go back with her I believe and Hannah to stay here
Cousin George Denrose and his Daughter is also come but
I suppose they were at Balletore. I wish [insertion]My Sister[/insertion] Sally had come
this time that I might have had thee at the Summer
Meeting that we might have spent a few more agreeable
days to gether before we are parted by a much more distant
way, thou may judge I am longing to see home never been
so long from my Father and mother before, but perhaps we
may sometimes have the pleasure of seeing some of you there
We have lost our agreeable Lodgers J. & Hannah Piper they
saild on third day, Hannah was but poorly and seemed desirous
to be gone, I had a letter from Dolly sinces but
they were not yet home, they kept house for us while we were
at Mothers, but I had like to forget to give thee some account
of our Journey there, we went in company with Cousin Dawson

and Molly Piper, [unclear][/unclear] Single, and there was Johnny Newby
and the two Simons, by way of taking care of Molly Piper
I got on the horse at the place we dined at and rode the
remainder of the way it blowed and rained some but we went
on and did not mind it much I was much better pleased
to be under it all than in the carriage, the Horse cantered nice[insertion]ly[/insertion]
I changed with Molly Piper coming in back also
It was not the least matter about delivering the Message to
B Fuller I have got the gown and intend sending by some of
your Family if they can take it conveniently - Cousin Thom[insertion]as[/insertion]
Wily is not yet come we expect him every day I fear he will
not get time enough I think the wind seems rather against
him. Dolly wrote me that he wast to be at Whetchoven last
first day and to come directly here, but perhaps he has altered his
intentions since. I should tell thee that Bob Backster wanted
sadly to see thy Letter to [insertion]me[/insertion] when I told him I had got one but
I put him off with a good deal to do, tell me did I act
right or wrong. I though it would rather be ungenerous to
show my Friends Letter, not because there was the least fault
in it, for I think it was without any sort of defect, but beca[insertion]use[/insertion]
of thought it would not have been agreeable - I have hardly left
room for love, but [deletion]accept[/deletion] [insertion]I send[/insertion] it to you all as if named I remain thy merry
sly Affectionate Jane Beale
