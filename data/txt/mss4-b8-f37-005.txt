Killuggan 4th May [underline]1825[/underline]
Dear William
I only write and see you to trouble you - A Case
of a most interesting nature has crossed me lately -
I don't Know whether my friend, your wife, remembers
a young female child of about 14 years of age
& of a respectable description, having been one day in
Ballitore about February or March twelve month -
she describes your house & family accurately, denied
with you, slept some where else and was off next
day - Mrs. L: wanted her to give her name which
she declined, as has been her habit almost everywhere,
but she has taken a particular fancy to us, and
has given, not only it, but all her Melancholy tale -
When she left you, she went on rambling till she
reached Youghall in the Cy. Cork - There she staid
7 Months with a Mrs Kent from whom I have had
a long letter about her, and who at length sent her
home in the Coach, after writing and rewriting to her
family about her to no purpose, every letter in reply disowning

her - she had been twice from home before, but
with those who had some distant Knowledge of her - she
then also denied at [underline]first[/underline], but when they found it was useless
they sent for her & brought her home - Her intellect is not very
good; at any rate, though [underline]foolish[/underline] on every other subject, she
seems to be [underline]insane[/underline] upon one - that of rambling her - her family
are odd people; she is not the first they have disowned; having
Denied this child's uncle while living, and another branch
of them suffering heavy damages under a prosecution
for the false imprisonment of a female relative for a trip
that hurt their supposed dignity - So that they are in the
habit of taking summary measures on all such occasions -
poor foolish creature she has at length fallen
a Victim to the intrigues of her own Cousin who seduced
her this time from her home, made her carry away a
considerable sum of money, which he pocketed - feigned
a Marriage with her and then turned her on the world
destitute, forlorn & helpless - She has been now near a
month here after visitting and stopping at the Neighbouring
Towns & houses of respectability as she came along -
I have written several letters about her to her friends,
her Mother and [underline]this[/underline] Cousin have both disowned her
to me, & seemed [underline]very Anxious[/underline] (the Cousin did) that I should
turn her out - But no, I'll see it out if I can - we have
them, I may say, convicted already, for the Mother, altho'
she has been denying the child to me, has acknowledged
to

to an Atty, in Dublin, whom I have warmly intrusted for her,
the articles she took away, and which her Cousin, the Villain
has long turned to his dissipated uses - she never Knew
he and I were connected in the business; but this was the
snare we laid for her - for him to write to her about them
according[deletion]ly[/deletion] to the child's description, and taking him
I suppose for a pawn broker, or something of the Kind, out
slipped the Cat from the bag - I don't care what their
Rank is, they are a cruel, unprincipled race, that every
friend to humanity would oppose in such an instance
as this - And did I not Know your ready and willing
disposition to aid in such a case, I should not have
called on you - One day's exertion
will do from you, [underline]if done well[/underline] -
& some ingenuity is required in
doing it - Her Mother is Mrs
Hume of Hume Wood Cy Wicklow, widow to the late
Mr. Hume who, is dead abt 11 years, and when alive was
Member for that County - Battinglass is their post
Town, but, I believe they live nearer to Hacketstown, the
place being about 8 Miles from the former, and about
4 from the latter town - If you know where a Village
called Kiltegan lies, it is close upon the demesne -
what is necessary to be done is to find out someone there,
in that neighbourhood, who could [underline]prove her identity[/underline]; this,
if they refuse to strike, would ground an Application in
the Courts above - And if the person would come [underline]here[/underline] immediately,
upon being paid (& how Much) to do it, as she seems
in too Much dread to approach near home - The Middling
classes

classes are the best to apply among - for of the Wealthy, we
may say 'birds of a feather flock together' - They will not tell
tales of each other - It must be done cautiously - not
to make much noise about it, or they will be put on their
guard and [underline]fear[/underline] to tell - The childs' name is Harriet, she
has 2 sisters, Clementina & Charlotte and one brother,
Frederick, at home, another brother, William, was in London
when she came away - The Atty in Dublin discovered
from a Wicklow common the truth of her story [underline]exactly[/underline] -

[underline]1..10[/underline]
8.2
The thing is to find out for [underline]our[/underline] satisfaction at least, if
[underline]all[/underline] the family be at home, and whether this one is absent -
manage it so as not to let them get a hint of such a proceeding,
or all would be spoiled - Is Richard cute enough
for such a business? Oh, if you were to go yourself it would
be well done - You will have this on Friday, and I wish an
answer, if possible by Sunday - So that you wd. have to go that
day & write that Night - Be [underline]particular[/underline] in yr. [underline]inquiries[/underline] & what you
write, to gather it all in a Nutshell, It is likely if all be favourable
you will soon see me - Love to Mary, Sally, Elizabeth & all friends from
all this family - Believe me, dear Wm. yrs. most truly - Peter North
