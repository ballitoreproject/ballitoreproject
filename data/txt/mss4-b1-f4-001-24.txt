P. 170. with one another, it is not well to let it be too publicly manifest: it may raise
jealously in others, cause invidious reflections, and be productive of many
inconveniences. Taking these little hints along with you, may you love
one another most cordially, say I, and may the Divine blessing
sanctify your love!

R. S. to his son.
*** Clouds filled with gospel - rain, wafted alone
by the Divine Spirit, compressed by the Almighty hand, and
discharging themselves on the people, is the perfection of
instrumental help. Yet to be looking too earnestly at these
clouds, and watching which way the wind (the spirit) is
driving them, is not the way for us to profit. "He that observeth
the wind shall not sow, and he that regardeth clouds
"shall not reap." *** We have abundant cause to rely
on that bountiful and gracious hand, and to trust in that
source of supply that has never yet failed. Seek [underline]first[/underline] the
kingdom, was the precept of the Great Master: -
Clonmel, on [unclear][/unclear] 8th of Tenth month 1702
