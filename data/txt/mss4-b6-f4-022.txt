New York 6th mo. 6th 1824
My dear Friend
I derived much pleasure
from the perusal of thy Epistle commenced in
Ballitore & ended in Limerick, which I received
by the Virginia a few weeks ago. It had been
long expected, but as I was aware of the
numerous avocations which daily claimed thy
time, I did not accuse thee of remissness or
forgetfulness.
I was glad to find thee in
Limerick, enjoying the society of thy amiable daughter
& some of thy old friends who have so frequently
partaken of "Athenian" hospitality. - The description
which thou gives me of thy first visit to
Limerick some forty years ago is exceedingly
entertaining. - What a fine retrospective field
was open to thy musings.- The majestic Shannon
still rolled on unchanged, & the ancient Cathedral
had no additional marks of age impressed upon it,
but among thy former companions, the old people
had descended to the tomb, & the young had
in their turn become old!
How much more
apt one is to moralize at the changes effected
by time in a distant place which we seldom
visit, than at home altho the events in themselves
may not particularly interest us! I dare say

thou [underline]felt[/underline] much older in Limerick than thou art
accustomed to do in Ballitore for this reason.
When I arrived at home from America, my feelings
were of this kind, & it was some time before I
could reconcile the change - the recollection of
boyhood, the appearance of the fields where I had
played when full of youthful frolic, & the affectionate
gaze of a mother who had always been as a
guardian Angel, frequently brought tears to my
eyes & filled my heart with melancholy pleasure!
If such be our feelings when we dwell upon [underline]past[/underline]
joys, & if the prospect of future changes gives
a still more sorrowful tinge to them, how
hopeless would be our situation, bereft of all
religious consolation! It often surprises me
that any persons of rational understanding or common
feeling should take pleasure in destroying this
last anchor of hope in others, even if they are
disposed to doubt themselves. - it is morally
dishonest in them to rob others of that which
does not enrich them. The belief in future
recognitions in Another World, appears to me to
be a delightful part of "Faith" - altho' how it is
to be I cannot, nor do I wish to explain - and
even supposing it to be unfounded (which [underline]I[/underline] do
not) yet it is an innocent consolation, which
as it does no harm, none ought to disturb.
- excuse this digression into which I have [insertion]been[/insertion] unintentionally
led.- -
I thank thee for giving me

credit for "Amor Patri√¶", - some of my friends
doubted me when I was at home, & I know not
but they may disbelieve still. Here my American
friends frequently ridicule me for applying the term
[underline]Home[/underline] to Ireland - they tell me it is time to
leave it off, & that I must consider myself an
American! but in reality they esteem me the
more for the unchangeable love I bear my
Native Land. If I were a hypocrite, good policy
itself would make me always praise Ireland,
because the Americans have too much
sense not to despise a man who abuses
his own Country - they can detect the [underline]intended[/underline] flattery
& refuse to swallow it - the flavour disgusts them!
I think my attachment to Ireland has
increased since my last return, & yet my
love of America has not decreased! "what a
contradiction", I hear some of you say - Not
at all - the claims of Country & of kindred call
me home: the hospitality & kindness of Americans
render my residence here agreeable.- Whilst I
keep Ireland in prospect, I consider myself as
a visitor in America, & of course it is both
lawful & expedient, to derive as much pleasure
& instruction as I can, from my visit. If
Providence should favour me, I may yet be
of some trifling use to my Country - as a willing
labourer in the vineyard. - much weeds have to
be plucked up, & good tillage to be introduced

before good fruit can be produced. Here they
understand many simple political maxims better
than you do in Ireland, yet it would not do
to change the system [underline]suddenly[/underline]- the great art
in improving a Government is to do it not too
hastily & to begin in the right place. They have
yet done very little for Ireland considering how
much there is to be done - but even the commencement
& that in a good spirit, is a great point gained.
The extension of Education, the renovation of the
Magistracy, the modification of Tithes will all
do something towards improving the Country:- & the
active spirit of Enterprise which has suddenly
appeared in Dublin, together with the repeal of
the Union Duties, will add greatly to the National
wealth. Now if the British Parliament would only
be wise enough to go a step or two farther
& grant Catholic Emancipation, & an allowance
to the Catholic Clergy, I believe that even
you who are advanced in life would live to
see Ireland in a new dress.-
I depend
a good deal upon the sympathy & justice of
the English people, for I believe they have
every desire to serve [underline]us[/underline]; but can we wonder
that they should falter in their liberality when
they see such a use made by the Roman Catholic
Hierarchy of the "[unclear]Hohenloe[/unclear] miracles"? I conceive
that his "Highness" has materially injured the
