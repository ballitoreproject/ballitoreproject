My Dear Madam
It gives me much concern that it is not
in my power to comply with your request on the
present occasion ~ On a late application to Lord
O'Neill I found him to pressed from various
quarters that though he seemed very anxious to
meet my wishes, yet he assured me it was not
in his power to procure any situation for the
person I solicited for ~ I should therefore feel very
reluctant in renewing my application at the
present time ~ If any opportunity should occur
in future, you may be be assured I shall not fail to
take advantage of it ~ With best regard to all your
family
I remain yours
very sincerely
John Paul
