Ballitore: Dublin Imean 22/9 mo: 1807.
My dear Betsy,
Next to heart next to mouth thou may say when thou reads the date. I was
comforted by hearing from my dear Wm. through Mary Doyle yesterday, & hope I
shall this day be favoured in like manner. Mary & I dined together yesterday at Jas.
Malone's & expect to breakfast together this morning at the widow Montiff's, near the
meeting house. She dined with me at Thos. Johnson's on first day. Helen & Agnes Christy
drank tea here that evening, which I believe is the only visit they have paid. Nancy
& Mary Chambers are much taken with them & they seem very comfortable there: the
old lady quite pleasant & finely in health. The Capt: went to the country in 1st day.
John Pim of London still in town, & spoke a few words in meeting on first day,
neatly & humbly like himself. I seem, like Christian, to be getting short of any burden,
every thing which appeared a mountain was made easier as I approached it, & Isaac
is at work, & has given specimens of it which I think you would like, & which
[unclear]ably[/unclear] disappointed me. He has not yet began the book, there are several
things to be done first, which are getting on, In we might [unclear]marall[/unclear]
reasonable hurry. Dr Bell has been with me, & exceedingly kind & anxious,
[unclear]with[/unclear] me to have Robt. Taylor's assistance, Robt. has not returned from Munster,
but is expected in a day or two. He would take upon himself the conceling the pup,
but thinks Robt better used to it, & strongly urges me not to spare time in getting it
correctly & properly done - this I say, not to prepare you. In a long stay on my part,
In I expect it will not be long, but to assure you it is not my wish to be absent from
home, "and all that renders home so dear". But this is really of importance since I have
in of a daughter, is recovering, though delicate. [insertion]After[/insertion] Nency Chambers suffering patiently, he is
proceeded so far, & am now, I hear, beginning to be tattled about, that is enquiry made
who I am &e. There seems no appearance of the blundering, sauntering delays we
had in the proposal printing, & that keeps up my spirits finely. John Wright's wife lay
in of a daughter, is recovering, though delicate. [insertion]After[/insertion] Henry Chambers suffering patiently, he is
not confined to his bed. E Johnson often very poorly. I hope she will come home with me.
Jane Duras poorly too, after the sea sickness, & sickness occasioned by medicine given
her since landing - She is a mild, pretty-looking girl. I hope thou art not perplexed with
family, children or post office. I know thou art equal to much, but do not do too much
I hope the children are well. Do make Deborah Richd. & Sarah write to me on one sheet

by post I long in their letter. I got a polite note from Counsellor Colles, they are out of town
Do my dear Betsy write often to me, & tell me all about every story & how my poor man is
& A Doyle, poor Molly Webster, & distressed Dolly Finn. Tell Mary I saw Pat, he looked very well,
has left Counsellor Colles, on account of an unruly home which he could not take on [insertion]with[/insertion] to manage, &
lives now with a Clergyman, one Ainslow in Kildare Street who knew him at the Inn. Peggy
Halfpenny at the Counsellor's Hall, & Mary Roche with Solomon Sproule. I am now at
Saml Doyle's where Mary & I are to dine. I have recieved thy letter & am greatly gratified by it, except
the news of Mary Stephen's removal & that is the worst news I heard this long time, & I fear will be a
source of trouble to us. We never enter the [unclear]forward[/unclear] letters in the Voucher but there to Killcullen &
C: Dermot, & I think the instructions say so. I gave thy love to our Scotch friends: they send theirs to you
all. Helen likes thy father much, says he is a "frank, canty, honest man." & as to Wm she told
me she was in love with him, so I told her I intended to fall in love with her husband when
I saw him, by way of retaliation. It was pleasant to them to hear of John; of whom they
think often & unduly, as I am a witness. MD & Shackleton with Widow Matiff I believe M Darmpon
Robt Fayle & I hear has arrived. This evening is too wet to go to him, I intend it in the morning &
now to love as little time as possible. Don James & Nan is very ill I hear, What to be in a
consumption & very poor. As Lydia intends coming & both MD & me have commissions for butcher
we think is best to stay till her arrival & not get them now. M Doyle is finely, & waits the opportunity to
go home, she is quite uneasy about Nancy. She bids me tell Anne that she is broke, & will be kept in
pledge if she does not send her a little money. She rieced Wms Letter, & wish do all he desired. She &
Hannah join me in dear love to you all. I am not come in. Say how my poor dear Wm. is in his
his health. Tell him I will make no unnecessary delay I hope- but some I must make to cut a
little figure in the world. Jane Sandwiths love to George thy affle & obliged Aunt M:L:
