Richmond 25th of 3rd month 1823
My dearest Sarah
It is surely time for me to congratulate
thee with my pen, on being a mother - my heart saluted
thee long since I intended often to write to thee & then again
feared I might injure thee. I wonder at the love I have for
[underline]Miriam[/underline], my unseen niece - I will not say unknown, for Elizth.
& George have made me intimate with her. I will write
to Elizth. by George - I was sincerely obliged to [insertion]her[/insertion] [deletion]Elizth[/deletion] for
Margaret's hair - the daisy - the pearl.
Betsy was to have left us with George, but we all
persuaded her to give us a few weeks longer - I seemed as
if I could not part her, & she seemed as if she could not yet
leave me, I will miss her less when I have something to do
at present I am still a lady - all my bridal visits not
yet paid - When George goes, which will be on 5th day, I
intend to begin the inspection of the house with Hannah,
and soon interest myself in the arrangement of the
castle. My father was getting on finely - was able to come
down stairs & eat meat - but he has got a slight relapse
we attribute it, partly, to hearing from Thomas of his
being ill again, with the same complaint as his
fathers, & in consequence, he intends to leave Darlington
goes to Lewes to see my Sarah & from that to Edinburgh
to spend the summer with her there, & then I know
not - nor he either - To have him thus again unsettled
of course - against the current & thus I used to be puzzled to know
which way the river went. Betsy desires her dear love to
thee - to Edward & to Elizth she wrote to E by James Pike
& he went in an earlier coach than we expected - but there
is another letter on the way to her - she hurried the old one
[underline]in spite[/underline], she says. Give my dear love to Elizth & tell her I
think it long since I conversed with her & that George will
bring her a long letter I hope. Have thy father & mother moved
to the 'bonny Glen' yet - remember me affectionately to them
to the boys & girls - To Eliza is my love & I intend to tell her
myself that she is not forgotten by either me or my spouse
I hoped to have made this letter longer but am greatly hurried
lest I should miss the post - I have about a dozen letters to
write by George, to day & tomorrow. I hope thou wilt write when
thou art quite able - I would be rejoiced to hear from thyself
of Miriam & of thyself, but do not hurt thyself to please me
My beloved sister farewell give my neice three kisses from
her loving aunt & thy sister

James's dear love. & Hannah's & George's my father is greatly interested
in Miriam and

affects my father's spirits. George & Hannah court admirably,
quietly & persevereingly - but it still depends on [underline]F[/underline] [underline]J[/underline]'s health the
fixing of the time of their marriage -
We were at one stitching party & it was the pleasantest we
were at in Limerick - we worked, & read Original pieces -
there was one written on our marriage - which was perhaps
as easily understood as Clarke's epithalamium on yours.
I told thee or thou knows all the amiabilities of this family
the father & uncle James are to me a source of ever new
delight - to think that I am to lead my life with such is
most agreeable & I hope I may never disturb the family
harmony. - My visions are all floating in a mazy distance
as to how James & I may ultimately be settled - for a time
I think it would be absolutely necessary that we should
stay here - not so much for pecuniary matters, as for
Sally's sake - she would be totally unfit to undertake
the management of [deletion]a[/deletion] [insertion]this[/insertion] house, after Hannah leaves it, both
from her extreme youth & inexperience - beside it would
be cruel to confine her at once in her prime of life, to
the nurse tending of her Grandmother - I think it would
kill her - She is a most sweet interesting creature & I
hope to have great happiness in her society - and then
perhaps after a time we may have a house of our own;
while I am here I am to be mistress, & every one of my
friends will be welcome to the master - though that
master will not be my [underline]spouse[/underline]. - A pro-pos I am not
disappointed in my spouse & that is a great deal for
admired her hair greatly - he is a delightful man.
My letter shows I am happy & contented but sighs will use in spite
of my philosophy & I could not help sighing deeply when I was at
[unclear]Claresville[/unclear] that the plan which arranged our living there, was
given up. - However I can see the progress of spring here, & am
near sweet aunt Harvey & those are compensations.
Hannah Harvey intends going to the yearly
meeting with Jacob, her brother - he is in Cork or on his way home
now - I [unclear]like[/unclear] all the Harveys even Thomas & Member's wife
& they are all affectionate to me.
again farewell.

a wife to say. - All I have written is as yet uncertain
& the product only, of a brain much given to Castle-building.
My dear love to Edward & I wish him much joy & satisfaction
in his wee pearl - James intended to write his sympathy
but I fear he will not have time before post hour.
It is long since the muses have visited me, or I would
invoke their influence to shed all blessings on my sweet
Miriam's head - I can not express the longing I have to
see her - to kiss her & "admire the babe the living image
of her sire" - it will hasten my visit to you I am certain.
would that we lived in Dublin - but wishes are most idle &
were I there perhaps ill health - bad success in business
thousand alleys might embitter my
life - oh! it is [insertion]this[/insertion] reflection that turns
the tear for Ballitore into a smile
and the sigh for - my beloved friends, into a prayer of thankfulness -
that reconciles one to the thought of Eben & Deb's
travelling - & thinking of her returning accompanied by the
greatest & most welcome stranger to her, sweet Health,
makes my heart leap within me - It is delightful
to have beings whom one [insertion]can[/insertion] love, & let all the feelings of
the soul expand & flourish on. And when I think of all
Eben's & Deb's perfections I am glad that there is some [underline]bitter[/underline]
which can be endured - lest they should die & leave us
for ever. - I was - or rather, we were, at uncle James' place
Clareville - it is most sweetly situated on the Shannon
where the Shannon is finest - we had in our prospects
this mighty river tumbling & foaming over rocks

Here the river is majestic & [underline]proud[/underline] & like an alexandrine
drags it slow length along" - but Brigs & Schooners & vessels
of smaller note give life to its bosom & sea gulls just
dipping on the water for the fish & then soaring aloft on
snowy pinions with their prizes, & wild geese, & seed
sparrows - but walls & [underline]made[/underline] banks spoil it. The
tide, which though [insertion]the sea is[/insertion] 60 miles from this, affects the river, is
with its stunning roaring - its banks beautifully adorned
with lawns gently swelling - trees - shrubs [unclear][/unclear] & mountains
in their clouded blue, [deletion]bounding the prospect[/deletion] It revived
my heart to see Nature's glories once more - oh! The darling
County Wicklow! - Clareville has hedges & primroses in
the hedges, like Ballitore - to see a hedge row, gives me
almost as much pleasure as a fine view used lang syne.
