A real drizzly morning
Charlie came out last night
to stay here during Philip's
absence as he intended to go
to Kilcandra with J Perry to day
I went down to Bracy to buy
some things and brought
Dick with me - I received
two letters from Polly - Ned
got an invitation to Obelisk
Park also, but does not intend
[extra line]
to go. -[insertion]After dinner,[/insertion] Poor Philip had a very
severe cold which I am afraid
will not be benefitted by his
expedition up the country.
he went after dinner to
meet his friends on the road
but they, , owing to some delay
were not there till four O'clock
and two was the hour [unclear][/unclear]
