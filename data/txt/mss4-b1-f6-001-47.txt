Dublin July 14th th 1783
Dr. Sir,
After more than eight years absence, I have
at last, arriv’d in my native Country; but I am
sorry to inform you not with so good a constitution
as I left it with, I do from inclination,
as strongly as from the Gratitude I owe to you &
your good family, make it my first business to
enquire after [insertion]yr[/insertion] health & prosperity of your family, for
I assure you tho much alter’d as [insertion]to[/insertion] my situation in life
& conversation with mankind in General: I have not
yet met with any people [deletion][/deletion]: I respect more, or
regard; than you & your family: I have not
arriv’d more than three days; and have enquir’d as
to the monies owe’d you, for myself & brother, and am
asham’d it has not been long ago paid; if It was in
my power it shou’d be very soon settled, but I have
been myself most cruelly use’d by my pretended
friends during my residence abroad; but have
thank God done better, than I believe any of them are
capable of doing for themselves; I shall in a short time
do myself the pleasure of visiting my old friends and
untill then Sir believe me with real sincerity your
very affectionate friend - Thomas Eyre Lt 35th Regt.
