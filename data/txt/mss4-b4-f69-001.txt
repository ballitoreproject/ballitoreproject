The warm manner my dear Cousin
Waterford, 11 Sep 1809

Since my last communication, Sir WheelerCuffe
has been here, & accomplished the business he came
about, the setting of some land to a person
residing in Waterford -- to his acquaintances
here, he made no secret of his intention towards
me, of confiding certain affairs to my management
in his absence. He wishes me to
spend next month with him, to arrange a
plan for what I am to do for him when in
England, whither he proposes going the following
month. On leaving Waterford, he set off
for the residence of Lord Lismore & gave me
reason to expect a summons shortly, which I
have without effect looked for daily for near
a fortnight, & must confess the time has appeared

tedious: as from the character I have received
of the Peer, I should be well pleased to be
under his patronage. I understand he lives at
no great distance from Cloheen, & have written
to cousin Sam Grubb with a list of interrogatories,
to which he has not thought proper
to send me written answers, but refers me
to a personal interview. If I should be
ordered to repair to this nobleman, I expect
the Mailcoach will convey me to Cloheen;
if I should be so fortunate as to meet my
dear Sally there it would be very grateful to
me. Pray express to my Friend Jo Harvey
my cordial acknowledgment of his kindness
My cordial acknowledgment of his kindness
in co-operating to befriend me
Yours sincerely, Wm Rayner
