My dear Cousin
Sally brought me thy kind &
pleasant letter, I am glad to hear that she
has an agreeable prospect before her I
hope she may find herself comfortable
& happy, I think it is quite likely that her
care & good sense may improve her charge,
so thou hast made conquests amongst
the peacokes & they seem'd to me to be
agreeable kind of people what little I saw of
them & I liked the look of their house very
much for a school & had thoughts of sending
Margt. there but I find that I cannot

well do without her & I also think she is now
too much advanced in years to send to a
boarding school, she is inclined to learn
what she can at home, however if she shd
go to school Chester wd be the place I wd
chuse for her particularly as thou art there,
Thou wilt be glad to hear that Aunt Sally
is as well as usual still walking about
with the help of Fanny Lyons, our other
relatives in Ballitore Moore & Stradbally
are all well both Eben & George expect an
encrease to their families pretty soon
Lydia Fisher [insertion]& hers[/insertion] [unclear]are[/unclear] very well Magt has lately
return'd from a visit of 2 months to her,
Didst thou hear of the Great Temparance
apostle who is going [unclear]thro'[/unclear] the South of
Ireland receiving Temparence pledges

from thousands on thousands if we may
believe the papers, his character for Sanctity
as a Priest makes it an unholy thing
to break a promise made to him, so that
it is thought that Ireland will at last
become a sober & enlighten'd country,
Willy for whom thou so kindly enquires
is on his feet again hobbling about & I am
in great hopes that time will effect a cure
for him, his cheerfulness still continues
 we had our little Charly sadly scalded
he bore his sufferings very well & is now
nearly well, - Remember that when the
2nd month comes I shall expect to get
a copy of the Valentine I [deletion]shall[/deletion] will not
begrudge 4 d to see it; long life to Rowland Hill.

We are settled in Dublin these some weeks,
Sally looks very well notwithstanding the
accident she must have suffer'd a great
deal from it, give my very kind remembrance
to Robt & Mary McKern & besure tell our
kind guide that I dont forget him, I wish
Margt knew thy graceful grandaughter

That time may come & farewell my dear Cousin
thou are the happy example that we augst
all to follow, how would such cheerfulness & gratitude
encrease his happiness Magt intends to speak
for herself, so I shall conclude & trespass of
thy spectacles no longer ever thy afft. Cousin
S Barrington
Edw. is very well & always well pleased to hear of
thy welfare & happiness
