for the [unclear][/unclear] of Earl [unclear][/unclear] rent, which I
[deletion]replyed[/deletion] answered by saying that I was
not authorised to do any such thing &
telling [insertion]him[/insertion] of the [unclear][/unclear] you had to wind up
the affairs of your executorship and alluding
to the unpleasant measures you were
obliged to adopt with some of the tenants.
To which note of mine he has sent
me the enclosed reply. I have a
copy of what I sent him which you
can see if you wish. She may I suppose
take him at his word and receive
the rent when he offers it. I met
Jo White to day and as far as I can
learn from him, there is but
a poor chance of our getting a
renewal for some time. Benj'm
Wilson being in America, he says
he must have the rent, shall
I pay him one year, due, when?
Let me know what I shall do about the


leases, [unclear]or tell[/unclear] likely I shall be employed
by Lydia and we can get yours done
at the same time I remain
your affectionate
