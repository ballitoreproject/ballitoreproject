Dear Cousin -
My Partner purposing setting off for
Dublin tomorrow, thought it right to take ye Opportunity
of writing a few Lines to give thee some acct
of my Family & more particularly with a view to
obtain a Letter from thee or thy Bro. & if not convenient
to either, it woud be some Gratification
to receive a few Lines from thy Sister Sarah
if she can'd make it convenient. May inform
thee, I have just recover'd from a very bad sore
Throat, wch reduced me very low; being unable to
eat or Sleep for several days - have ye attack
of that complaint abt once a year, but never
had it so bad before
My Wife & family has since I
wrote thee [insertion]last[/insertion] been favd with good Health - wch I shall
be pleasd to hear if has been ye case with
you at Ballitore. also what addition is made
to thy Family & how thou [insertion]hast[/insertion] recover'd - My Eldest
Daughter Sarah is going in a few days to ye
School at York & I hope will make some
improvement there - Hannah & [unclear]Edith[/unclear] is still
at [unclear]Achworth[/unclear] & John at a School at [unclear]Gildermane[/unclear]
a few Miles from me, all of wch have good Health
wth ye two Boys wch I have at Home
I think if I
live till Midsummer shall endeavor to see you

at Ballitore as probably my Business will lead
me to Dublin -
How art thy Bro & Elder Son &
Daughter who neither of them was very well
when I was with you - hope they have got
stout & with ye remainder of their fine flock
art favd wth good Health - dont omit mentioning
my mother to whom wth ye other Branches of
ye family please to remember me kindly to
not forget. thy Sisters Family at Athy; &
was I as much acquainted wth thy Sister
Grubs family might make ye same request.
Perhaps wou'd understand Benj
North & his Wife is gone from this place
to superintend ye School at York - we are
sorry to part with them: but they can but
be in ye way of doing good & if we do but fill
up ye place allotted us with propriety it will
be well - My Sisters are pretty much favd
with good Health also their family.
