30 Aungier- Street 2 Mo. 12 - 1818.
Dear Sarah
I received thy letter dated the
4th of this year, which although short, was very acceptable -
but I hope thou wilt not suppose that its shortness
was the cause of its being more acceptable than it
would otherwise be - no on the contrary, every line in addition
would have increased its value - The latest account
which I got of your adult school was in that
letter, & so it may again fall to [underline]thy[/underline] lot to inform me
of the proceedings of the committee & what good has arison
out of that evil.
Thou [underline]prescribed[/underline] liquorice - ball for my [deletion]cold[/deletion] [insertion]cough[/insertion] & Mary
Chandler gave it to me, so between you both you cured
it, I finished the last bit of it last night. Well - I
am glad thou art creeping on through Fenelon, I wish
we could spend an evening together, like one of those
we used formerly, reading & making our remarks on that
author perhaps we may shortly have an opportunity -
Thou asks How comes it that the Roman Church does
not bring forth so good fruit in these days? Tho' the waste
is so much on that improving hand, according to Thomas
Fisher " I answer, because altho' the [underline]World[/underline] is improving
yet the [underline]Roman Catholic church[/underline] is on the decline
which indeed is one symptom of the improvement of
the world. If the Romish Church does not bring forth as
two months. He [deletion]says[/deletion][insertion]tells me[/insertion] in one place "My uncle Harvey having read Jacob's
letter which thou sent me & which I received a few days ago. has just
asked me whether Jacob's reasoning has convinced thee of this mistake, I answered
him that I believed not, when he replied with some warmth,
"that he thought it ought, & that it was very wrong for thee to indulge
"in such unqualified abuse against the government under which thou
"livest." In another place he says "I have not the least doubt but
"that Rush's essays will be read & admired in Ballitore, his opinions
"are very consonant with those of these Athenians. The Barbarians
"here in the south have not much taste for such productions, I am
"sorry to say it; but however among us. I find a few who are worthy
to be Grecians & in whose company & conversation I find pleasine.
"I do not mean by that to insinuate that I think myself
"excluded from the enlightened world but I mean that there are but
"a few whose tastes coincide with mine xxx. Recreation may be & I
"believe is very necessary to men of business, but it is very hard to obtain it.
"I am heartily tired of confinement but I still plod on, hoping that I
"may at last like it. If I ever do, my inclinations must most materially
"alter. I do not know that I ever had a desire for any particular
"profession, but I think I should like to study physic if I had
"application sufficient, but that is now impossible xxx Thy enthusiasm

many good men are formerly, I believe the reformed churches
produce more now than she did then. I have been lately
reading Young's Night Thoughts, & admired the last
book so far more than any of the others, & recommend
thee to read it if thou has not done so before. Perhaps
thou & Mary [insertion]S.[/insertion] might read it together, as I know she
is a great admirer of Young.
How is Deborah? When thou writes please give me
a [underline]particular[/underline] account of her. - It was a great pity she
did not continue the practice of riding.
This is the wedding day! I wish them joy. Did Lydia
get the parcel which I sent to her lately tell her to answer
my letter: Jospeh Bayle is getting on finely now; he is downstairs
I breakfasted at his mother's yesterday, & spent an
hour with him, talking about Spurzheim & Doctor Macartney.
The remaining three of the Quaternion have [deletion]not[/deletion] [insertion]met[/insertion]
twice since his illness; but we are waiting for his recovery
to begin Dugald Stewart which we mean as a
[underline]dessert[/underline] after Gibbon. I think it an excellent substitute
for Lalla Booth. I lately spent a very delightful
first day evening at Samuel Bewley's which pleased
me so much that I intend [unclear]soon[/unclear] going out there again.
I lately had a parcel from Jacob Harvey containing a
letter from him, [insertion]&[/insertion] No. 9 of the "Friend of Peace" together with
a few American Magazines, all which I send to thee
hoping thou will return them, when all the Athenians
have perused them, who feel interest in them.
"is cooled with respect to America - that is matter of great triumph to thy
"loyal friends here, my uncle James & aunt Jane especially & of great
"mortification to thy republican brother - I hope however that thy
"republican principles & anti-royalism are unshaken - tho' thy ideas
"of the English character may be raised, that is no reason why Britain
might not be a republic. xxx My aunt Mary & her little Rebecca
"are perfectly well now. Margaret [unclear]Unthank[/unclear] has got a son. Expect to
hear from me soon. - The above is [deletion]what[/deletion] [insertion]all that[/insertion] I thought thou might like
to hear in that letter; I wish he was not so closely confined. I am
afraid his health will be injured by it.
Doctor Macartney gave us a lecture last monthly meeting day on
the craniological system of Gall & Spurzheim, which I left the meeting
for discipline to attend, he agrees with Spurzheim in a few things, but
differs from him essentially in many others. He says he has never found
him wrong with respect to the organ of languages "or "memory" which is
placed in the eyes, he says himself is [deletion][/deletion] an instance of the truth
of it, as his eyes are rather sunk in, & he has scarcely any memory
He says it would break his heart to spend a month in [unclear]Feinaigle's[/unclear]
school. Our king, he says is an instance of a good memory, & he
has prominent eyes.- I drank tea the night before last [deletion]with[/deletion] at Thomas
street, with Eliza Gough We were very pleasant as it was month
[unclear][/unclear] Thompson [unclear][/unclear] Chandlee

Did Thomas Jacob's son Robert call on you on his way
home. I was greatly pleased with the portion of his company
which I enjoyed, while he was here, as I think
very highly of him, in many respects. I spent a very
pleasant evening at the Doyle's in company with him.
Joseph Humphrey & Edward Alexander. [deletion]I saw Harriet[/deletion]
I paid Harriet Lefanu a visit about a week ago,
she was very well; I did not see any of them but
herself & her father the latter was going out just as
I went in. -
Doctor Macartney a few days ago congratulated his pupils
on his having got over the most uninteresting part
of the course of Sections; & since that his lectures have
been very interesting indeed, I am beginning to like
both them & him better & better. He answers any
question that we put to him with the greatest cheerfulness,
& interests himself very much in [deletion]their[/deletion] [insertion]our[/insertion] instruction.
He was lately feeling my forehead, & told me
that I had not the organ of individuality. - Tell
Mary Shackleton that I received her note, & that I answered
all her father's questions in a letter to thy mother,
& that one reason for my not writing yet to
himself is; that I may [deletion]see[/deletion] happen to see John
Shekleton again & [insertion]may[/insertion] give [deletion]him[/deletion] [insertion]thy uncle[/insertion] some further account
of my intercourse with him. - I had a long letter from
my brother James last 2nd day, he has been exceedingly
busy of late which prevents his writing to me oftener.
this was the first letter I received from him for nearly
by meeting night, & consequently [unclear][/unclear] Mary [unclear][/unclear]
her love to thee & Lydia, & desired me to tell thee that she would write
to thee, only that she has so much to do that she has not time to write
to any one. I lately bought Chalmers's Sermons, there is a very beautiful
one among them "On universal Peace", which I am sure thou would
like. Love to all the Athenians. I hope thou wilt excuse my freedom
in writing thee so long a letter - but remember a good part of
it is extracted matter. Thine sincerely
I hope thou wilt answer this soon.
