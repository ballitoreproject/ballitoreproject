Dear Madm
I have this day received the
favor of your very kind letter; and immediatly
answer it, lest not hearing
from me might prevent [unclear]your young[/unclear]
Couple from closing with another
party -- my Sister has been confined
Since Novber with a pain in her Eyes
and not able to leave her room. so
that untill the Middle of April; (when
we hope the weather will get a little
warmer) we can not even think of
leaving Dublin at that time if yr
Son in Law has not set his Lodgings
or if then, then the terms of the small
or if them, then the terms of the small
House we will then I hope be able

to let them know what we could
with Convenience give: and perhaps
close with Mr & Mrs Shackleton but this
is to leave them at full Liberty -
I must Observe with out any
flattery: that the Society of Friends has
been ever very Dear to me and my
sister; and that some of our most respected
and esteemed friends belong
to the meeting, and one of the earliest
and first known resides in your town.
I mean our Dr Hannah Davis -- we
shall be thankful to you to remember us
to her and her Daughter -
a line from you if convenient, and
left with Mrs Johnson Parliament Street
will reach. Dr Madm yr Obliged friend.
my sister desires
her Compt. & thanks to Mrs. Gayle
Helen Homer
