Selby 5th month 7th,, 1813
My dear Cousin
Thinking thou wilt be anxious to hear from
me induces me to write thee a few times to inform
thee that we are in good health and to thank thee
for thy letter by which I learn that thou and thy
family are likewise well I am much pleased with
the account thou gives of thy Daughters; my Son
has increased his family by the birth of a
Daughter about six months ago; my Son Samuel
has been out of his apprenticeship 8 months
he has met with a situation in a Friends
family at Nottingham his master's name is
Baker my Daughters are both with me I live
in my Fathers House. Cousin Sally Armitage
is very well and desires her love to thee as also
John Armitage who is very well. Mary Procter
is liveing and is in tolerable good health.
Cousin Hartley lives at York and is I believe
very well I have not seen her of some time

my Daughter Patience saw about 16 months ago
she was very stout indeed. in thy letter I
observe thou wishes to know if Margaret Estill
ever married I may inform thee that she
married Herbert Camm a respectable friend
by whom she had two children a Son & Daughter
the latter is with Mary Procter and is
a fine young woman Margaret has been
dead several years. am sorry for thy Sister
Chandliers Husbands illness am [insertion]glad[/insertion] she as comfort
in children. We have none of neighbors
Tompsons family living; did thou know
Rebecca Andrew she was used to be at neighbour
Tompsons she was married twice by her first
husband she had one Daughter by her second
she had no child but was comfortably settled
she this month put a period to her existence
by hanging herself she had been in a low
disponding way for some time. I can assure
thee I should be extremely happy to see thee
but hardly dare indulge the thought

but hope if ever thou Visits England thou
will extend thy journey as far as Selby I
should likewise be very glad to see any of
thy family or thy relations. my daughters
once saw the Poems which thou wrote, which
they liked very much and have often wished
to purchase them but cannot, they would be
much obliged to thee if at any time thou
could send them the Poems they would not
trouble thee could they get them in England
my children unite with me in love to thee
thy family and thy relations thy sister Sarah
in particular.
I remain with the greatest respect
Thy affectionate Cousin
Jane Shilleto
PS this is a strange patched up
letter I am quite ashamed of it but
hope thou will excuse it
