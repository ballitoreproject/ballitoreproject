in by the 9 O'clock train,
having at least so far as
concerns myself, spent a
very pleasant day.
20th.. After breakfast, as soon
as we were both ready, Margt
and I sat down to read
and work., to read the
lives of [insertion]the[/insertion] Von Humboldts, a
very interesting book; we
had just finished a long
discussion on the earth
seasons &c - when the
clatter of horses hoofs in
the court announced
the carriage - which we
were expecting. Papa &
Mama came in.
The day was a very
wet one indeed.
