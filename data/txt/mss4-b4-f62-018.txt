My dear sister,
from Ballitore, – I am about a month here, & have
been in the sea not quite a dozen times, – I was prevented
some time by the cold weather & being poorly
& heartless myself: – One 1st day morning Jane Sandwith
kindly call'd on me, & took me on her car to Dublin,
she call'd earlier than I expected & I had not got
my breakfast, but [underline]did[/underline] at Saml. Bewley's before meetg.,
in which my stomach grew painful in the old way,
wch. I had not felt the least of for several months:– I
went after meetg. to Joseph Williams', Jane gave me
medicine & covered me up on a bed, when she went
for afternoon meetg., I did not get ease till a little
before 10 o'clock; Betsy Bewley got me a little gruel
& had my feet bath'd, – next day I was finely till
evening, when I had a slight return, & for several
Dunleary 8th month 1806.
Thy last was sent after me
days

days I felt weakly, & as if a smallish lump of lead was
shaking about in my stomach: – 'tis now quite bravely, &
I take a few delightful dips every day: George & I feel
lonely after our dear Betsy, whom they wanted home
to help them to marry Lydia &c. We expect we have
good reason for hoping George's foot mends, but a cure
will be tedious I suppose: – he bears the confinement &c.
very patiently. I came here on a 3d. day, the 1st. day following
I sat with poor Wm. & Fanny North, their son &
his wife &c:, I thought the young wife seem'd restless,
& I grew so, & proposed our not sitting long– we thereupon
broke up, & there proved to be cause for uneasiness, John's
wife's time was come & away they hurried to town,
Fanny went with them, but her husband growing very
ill Betsy Shackleton went off in gingle to inform
them thereof: as soon as poor Fanny saw her first
grand-daughter born she hurried home to her dying
husband: Wm.'s illness was not very long apparently, yet
he was a considerable time rather poorly; – he seemed apprehensive
his time was nearly come, & did not seem shock'd

shock'd at the approach of death, which took place (in
a remarkable quiet manner a few minutes after Betsy
& I had been by his bed-side. This day (1st) I did not
go to town, I do not like leaving George alone; Fanny, her
sister & niece sat with us, in our pleasant little apartment, –
I thought it felt rather comfortable, & the belief
animating that [underline]Good[/underline] is not confined to place or company.
Perhaps [underline]thou[/underline] might have some influence with out R:S,
but few here seem to have any to signify; his father has
been rather perplex'd about his hats, – he bought another [unclear]here[/unclear]
 his mother desired when I wrote to thee I would not got
 mention thy sending one he left in Clonmel, whenfore meetg.,
a suitable conveyance offers. It was agreeable to me to
be with thy dear Sally, & her affectionate father, in Enniscorthy,–
yet my heart ached for her, – her mind seemed very
sweetly disposed: I hope she will be rightly supported thro'
all that may occurr. Dost think my friend Robt. Fayle
will ever have any chance? – I believe he is closely attached
to Anne, & possess an excellent heart: he treated us
with his company to tea the other evening. Well, I think
[underline]I[/underline] should regret losing your decent, agreeable, respectable
Ally, – I quite admir'd her in her station. I saw Wm. Heren
in

in Enniscorthy – he seem'd pretty throng about some religious
matters, – look'd spruce & talk'd of visiting Betsy Penrose.
I do not recollect hearing of Robt. Dudley's death till thine,
Ah the poor fellow! – he was once lovely & pleasant. I do
not hear half as much of my much loved Mary as I
could wish, Oh if she would but write me a little history
of herself & her's I should enjoy it much: – [underline]hint[/underline] it to her.
It is agreeable to find that Jo: Fisher did not break his heart,
& that such melancholy circumstances are quite uncommon.
With dear love to you all I bid [underline]thee[/underline], my dearly beloved
sister, farewell.
S: Shackleton.
