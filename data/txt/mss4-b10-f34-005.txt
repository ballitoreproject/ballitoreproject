My dear Selina
I called in
Britain Street
yesterday evening
- to see if everything
was right
about the presentation
- but
I forgot to say
to any one - that
I believe it is
necessary - the
2 friends who
are appointed by
Dublin should
communicate with
the 2 appointed
here - before our
Monthly meeting
on 6th. day -
I may be wrong

but least I may
be right - perhaps
you would drop
Margaret a line
about it - If they
have to do it -
they may not
know our monthly
meeting comes
so soon after theirs
and if any communication
is
necessary - they
could make it
to J. H. White -
I arrived home
a little after 8 o'c
- I dont think
they expected me
- as the Kettle
was not boiling
& the tea was not
comfortable - If
you had been
expecting me - I
expect it would
have been more
so -
Dont forget that
I gave you the
patterns -
Let me know
if the 16th. is
positively fixed
on
ever yours
