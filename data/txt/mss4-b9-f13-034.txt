Richmond 19th of 11th month 1828
My dearest Sarah
Dost thou remember this very month 6 years
poor uncle James called to pay me a visit at your house. - &
dost thou remember the lock of fine flax he showed us. - & how
agreeable thou thought him. Today - this morning he was laid
beside his wife his early loved, & deeply lamented - his little
daughter Affy's coffin was taken up & placed upon his - & the
grave then closed. The poor widow is to return to her parents
today with her poor little orphan Mary Rebecca - who is very
like her father - She seems a delicate little creature. and so
closes the drama of his eventful life. Our father is greatly
grieved, though he bears it with his usual outward calmness
I heard of Ben Fisher's intending to seek your Babel
to day, & I thought I would write a few lines to thee
telling thee how we were & about our little Willie &c '&c &c
We are all well - and I am longing for thee to see us all. including
Master Wil who is as like his father as [underline]"eggs is eggs,"[/underline] in my
eyes at least. He is the merriest little piece of life we
ever had, being as noisy as [insertion]such a[/insertion] little frame can command
comic tones, but seldom cries. I felt very queer when
I heard of thy children going to school - it seemed as if
it was but yesterday since we were going ourselves to
poor Molly Webster, & it made them feel older to me.
than they are. I picture Johnnie & Meg trotting off with
their baskets - some bread in each, for they will eat as much
as they will work - I confess, in spite of new systems
I approve of it. Ah! Sarah when shall we see thee! We are
all wishing greatly for the happy day - My father used
to talk of bringing thee home with him from Ballitore
but now I do not think he can go this winter, as
he [deletion]has[/deletion] [insertion]will have[/insertion] so much to do regulating his brother's affairs -
Enter nous. I hear all is left without reservation - after all debts

are paid, to afty - uncontrolled power, & no mention of the
bairns. Did not Salomon Sproule do the same. My father
is one of the executors - she & her father the others. I know
thou wilt be pleased to learn that my father purchased
my uncle's share in Richmond & that we are more firmly
fixed in the dear spot - than ever - that is to mortal kin.
How are all at the Glen - and is Eliza in Ballitore? please
give my love to them. -Deborah writes in good spirits to
me & rejoices in having sweet Selina with her. I suppose
thou wilt hear the relation of a queer event from her, if I
do not [unclear]foxstab[/unclear] her. - Thou must know we had a very
handsome servant - young tall fair blackeyed & with all
dignified & discreet in her manners & behaviour, most
proper, most demure - greatly esteemed and trusted by
all - when lo! last second day night week, she surprised
us all & shocked & grieved us by giving birth to a little
daughter - alas! the unfortunate creature betrayed by
her conduct both before & after, the most hardened &
quiet depravity - she is not married, - & a sevant man
or boy, rather, whom we parted some months ago is the
father of the child - She did not seem to care a pin about her
shame. I could not tell thee how much I suffered on her
account - I felt so horrified at the thought of her future
fate, & she so unfeeling herself. We sent for her mother
& gave her into her charge - in a few days she went away
& we hardly minded the night being stormy & wet, when
she sought her own home. so much more were we occupied
by uncle James's danger - But in the dead of the night
I could not sleep with thinking of her & blaming myself
for not preventing her going - though indeed at the time
she went I did not know. - & fearing I would have her
death to answer for - or worse than death, if she felt herself
thus thrown unpitied on the world. With a trembling heart

the next morning I got the child's maid to send
to know how Catherine was - when lo! the account
she was finely & never [insertion]had[/insertion] had a better night's rest. To be
sure I was relieved - though I cared for her less. - & so ends that
affair shameful & shaming as it was. - I hear the priest
insists on their marriage & her mother says she would
rather Catherine would have three more such children
than be married to this boy. - The mother is worthy of
the daughter - but as the authorities have taken her
hands, my mind is much more easy.
I would thank thee to have two large boxes
of candles sent to me; one containing kitchen candles
I think my friend John will not think much of the
trouble - I suppose they could come by boat - or perhaps
with Ben Fishers goods - for I heard something of
Grantham's boats being stopped
for debt - but perhaps this
is only miscollected scandal.
I would also thank thee to send me 7 yards of jet black
Levantine - it is for a winter cloak & is to be either lined
with fur or wadding - so perhaps thou could enquire
what the cheapest lining fur would cost - that I might
judge before I bought. - also what the best velvet is p yd
for a bonnet & cape. - If the levantine is much dearer
than the black lutestring I would not like to get it
If thou can do this commission for me without much
trouble & write to me about it by post - I can perhaps
answer in time, to get them back by Ben. - but
if thou art not well - or busy &c, &c. do not bother thyself
for I would rather never wear a silk cloke than make
my dear sister more ill or more fatigued. thou has given
me a fright by saying he is desired to ride for dropsical

symtoms. - Is he alarmingly affected? - Ah! Sarah our
happiness lies in vessels of clay - and all too easily
broken. - However both E & D write in very good spirits.
I suppose he has left Dublin. James is anxious to know
whether we are in your debt & I cannot inform him
perhaps dear Sarah thou can. I write in haste, for I fear
I shall not catch Ben, who is very rapid in his motions - My
dear love [insertion]to[/insertion] Edward. - We know very little about you & indeed you
may say the same of us - we are bad scribes. - Oh! I forgot my
furs entirely - I suppose they are worth nothing but to send
home again by the eternal "Ben" I am sorry thou wert bothered
with them & I heartily hope they have not infected thee
with moths, which must have been one of the Egyptian plagues
they & boys - to which they are next in torment & difficulty
of banishing. Sally's dear love to thee - & I am most affectionately
James bade me give thee his "constant & undiminished love"
thine LJ Fisher
