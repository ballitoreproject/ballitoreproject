My dear E- We are to lose Deb tomorrow I hope she
is nothing the worse for her visit, I think she looks
better than when she came, poor Emily is still
very ill we are in much anxiety on her account
I hope the gay creature may be spared to us
we seem rather on the mending [unclear]trend[/unclear] here
Willy has got his appetite again & I hope will
soon be fit to come down stairs little Roger
seems as if he could bear a good deal without
losing flesh he looks very well altho
he is just recovering from a very heavy
cold - I enclose the a letter which thou
might send to the tenants on the Hill
for their perusal if thou approve of it
I think it is better to write to thee than
to them as I do not know their names
& [deletion]thou might send the letter up to them[/deletion]
if thou dont like this plan let me
know & I shall do whatever thou wishes
about the matter there is a Police man
looking for one of the new houses
if there is an old one uninhabited he
might have it at the same rent that
the other tenants pay I would also
wish that McAvoy had the places
he wants thou can put what conditional

Rent thou thinks proper on it & if thou
thinks he pays enough now thou need not
ask more I know not what any of them
pay except the Coachman who pays 1/8
per week - I would be glad to be
able to pay the head rent & have something
besides for myself ever thy SB
I'd rather than 2s/2d I could go to see
you & the houses
