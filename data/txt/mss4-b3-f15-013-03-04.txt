Ballitore: 14th of 10th month 1786

My dear friend
++ It does not look likely that  &  will get over their present indisposition. Happy for them if their spirits undergo an effectual preparation for their solemn change, which it is to be hoped will be through infinite [word crossed out] condescension, will be the case. Short is our date at the longest, this Infinite Wisdom knows, and that the work to be effected in that short time is of the utmost importance - therefore by various dispensations suited to various states, as by what touching wheel, he encourages us to co-operate with the [page number] 236 motions of his own good spirit in order to our sanctification & redemption. Great indeed is his goodness, he does not chastise nor afflict willingly the children of men; but he seeth and knoweth our various frames and textures, and what kind of treatment here will be our everlasting interest hereafter ++++
Now, my dear friend, I will bid thee farewell. Be of good cheer - dont be musing too much on the gloomy side of things. Turn the minds eye, and the minds ear inward - see if there be not in a good degree of rectitude & order there, and hear whether there be not a voice which speaks peace & a word of reconciliation. May this from day to day be thy comfortable experience is the sincere desire of			R.S.
