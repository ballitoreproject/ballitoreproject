Papa enquied of one the car-men - but all
we could learn was that lodger's who kept
a carriage at Quims [deletion]now[/deletion] [insertion]had taken a house[/insertion] down on the [unclear]stran[/unclear]
so having left Papa at the station we
drove to Quims and I sent Mick in
to enquire whether a Miss Newman kept
a carriage there - An age having elapsed
Mick returned accompanied by a coachman
in demi=toilette - "Here's the man himself"
says he from which I inferred he meant
the driver of the above mentioned carriage,
who began at once to direct me to the
house on the strand - "is it to Miss
Newman's you mean" said I "yes Miss"
and Miss Downes is with her - "all right"
thought I and away I drove, [unclear]down[/unclear] out
the house and who should meet me
at the very door but Georgina just the
same as ever only a little thinner -
Well to be sure we had a chat
but not a very long one as I could
not stay away from this - so I made
her promise soon to come up and see
me and we parted -
July.
