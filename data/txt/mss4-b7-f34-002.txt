Clonmell 7mo 25th 1786.
Coming here on our way to Solomon Watson's
Com'ing here on our way to Solomon Watson's
in order to accompany Dr. Saml. Neale, & his sweet wife, so far
on their way home wards, & to pay avisit there; - recollecting
my Dear M: Shackleton, whilst they are busy calling here
& there; - & [unclear]Cons. N. L. Grubb[/unclear] bustling about, - about other business
I entered the front Parlor, & silently looked about for a bit
of paper, with the other apparatus for writing, wch. tho' none
of them are of the first quality, yet having found, (the paper
behind the glass 
because of it's uncleanness,) I was pleased with the opportunity
of writing thee a line; - expressive of renewed affection, & of that
Satisfaction I hope to enjoy in a visit from thee under my
own roof; - which tho' it will probably be a solitary dwelling
in comparison of the more joyous & chearful scenes with wch.
thou hast been familiar; - yet by the Sweet influences of
true love, & every exertion to render it agreeable, within my
limited power, I hope for awhile it may be comfortable
to thee; - and I shall consider it as a favour to have my
habitation (expected to be often gloomy) gilded by thy Chearfulness! —
but I am under the necessity of defiring my
return to Waterford longer than I would [underline]now[/underline] wish, as the

little necessary furniture I had bespoke, was not finished, nor
is likely to be so, so [deletion][/deletion] [insertion]as[/insertion] to allow of my fixing in my
Lodgings till after the Meeting at Youghall; immediately
after; - I foresee some inconvenience may arise to thee
in com'ing hither previous to thy visit to me, but I hope
not much; — and I expect thou will return with me from
this place, directly after the above mentioned time; If I go
to Youghall Meeting, as I expect I may, if all be well; I
must return this way, in order to call for my daughter.
I shall be obliged to thee to present my endeared Love to
my Beloved Sister L. Watson, I shou'd be glad to hear from
her; to my Dr. Cousin Watsons, I shou'd have wrote, or at
least designed it, but time at present does not admit
thereof, so as to go by thy Father; but having a frank for
Balirdarton, I think to write Cousin Dinah tomorrow, my
love attends them. My Dr. Mother I salute with my whole
heart, also Abram, & Lydia, not forgeting my precious
Sally, all of whom I wish to remember me, as I remember
them! — Present me kindly to Aunt Elly &c. and
believe that I am truly in the fullest sence of the word
thy affectionate frd. MWatson
