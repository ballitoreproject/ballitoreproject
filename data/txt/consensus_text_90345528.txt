October 28th,, 11 1/2 O'clock at night in
a tolerably comfortable bedroom which
is brightened up by a cosy little fire
but has rather a close gas-y smell
To judge from the uncommon
stillness and silence which reigns
I conclude that all are gone to
bed and to sleep - Ned is located
next door to me and seems
pretty well satisfied with his little
dormitory - indeed everything is
a degree better than what I was led
to expect and so far I have not
been in the least disappointed .
[deletion][unclear]Doctor[/unclear][/deletion] Just awhile ago a man's
voice attracted my attention and on
glancing at the door I perceived
Doctor [unclear]Bartie[/unclear] who came to see if
I were comfortable and to ask
some questions about Ned -
St Annes
