From the same to the same

Ballitore: 22/1 month 1773

Dear Cousin,

	+++ I am glad to hear find that thy beloved companion continues to recruit. I doubt not your gratitude for so signal a favour. I believe the eye of Heaven is over you for Good, & that as ye are faithful through all the manifestations of duty, he will crown your heads with his favour (which is more precious than any earthly diadem) though for his own wise purposes, ye may as all his children expect to be tried in the furnace of affliction. Indeed the ballast of trouble is often necessary for our unsteady vessels, & good & wise is the Gracious Hand which freights us therewith along with the other lading which he mercifully bestows. The trangression [sic] ^of the law^ in the heart, whether by acts of commission or omission is the great evil which we ought to dread & deprecate; that we may not be led into temptation but delivered from this evil. All the rest it would be our wisdom, & conduce to our quietness of mind to have to unsearchable Wisdom, which ^who^ knows best what is best for each of our various states, habits, manners & dispositions. May the Lord strengthen & enable us to do his will, whether by acting or suffering, but striving or forbearing; for herein along consists our solid peace & capacity to be of any effectual service in the Church of Christ. +++ Things are low tis true in this Province, yet there are ma^n^y helpful young plants. Few nursing fathers & mothers indeed to cherish & encourage them, but if they take root downwards, & receive their nutritive moisture from the mother spring, they will perhaps be full as hardy, & as likely to sustain this winter season, as those which have been in times when there was more advantage of gospel showers from the instrumental clouds. I greatly desire the preservation of these precious plants; for much seem to depend [page number] 168 on it, as to a propagating & reviving of the cause of Christ ^Truth^ in another generation. ++
	I do not know where honest Robert Willis is now, but suppose about Cork, where I understand the time of singing of birds is come, & the voice of young ministers is heard in this land. It is a voice which has not been very frequent of late years in this poor nation. Silence has reigned much in our religious assemblies. There is an ear which can try voices, sounds & words, & knows of what country each language is: & Time must prove the stability of every birth. In this day of comparative darkness & gloominess our silent meetings are often flat & heavy. If ministers be raised up by Divine Power, they will be ^as^ a flame ^of fire^ to kindle a general sacrifice: but I think of the two evils more tolerable is the heavy cloud occasioned by irreligion & spiritual indolence, than the dismal, terrifying flashes of a strange fire. +++ [pencil mark cross]
	My Peggy, at the solicitation of our respectable friend Elizabeth Pike, went to spend a few weeks with her. I had a letter from her yesterday, part of it to this purpose.
Dublin: 19/1 month 1773. I was at meeting this day where I saw John Conran. I guessed it was he before I was told, by the sweet solidity & composure of ^which^ his countenance ^plainly^ indicates: his dress was also a little singular, having a plain, friend-like hat & cross-pockets. I am sure I am not by any means a judge in these matters; but I thought he looked like a person wrestling in spirit for the blessing. Few seemed by outward appearance to be so deeply exercise, tho I perceived no visible emotion. J Conran had been a pupil of mine  I have had some sensible letters from him lately  I wish well for him: & one thing encourages my hopes in a particular manner; that my honest wife seems to have near sympathy & unity with him, & rather sanguine in her expectations that if he be faithful to the discoveries of Truth which have already appeared to him, & obedient to the requirings of duty, which she believes he is already sensible of, he will be an useful instrument in the Lords hand to awaken the careless professors amongst us to a consideration of the profession which they are making, & to let them see that it they continue in a state of spiritual sloth & supineness, that the nominal children of the kingdom will be in danger of being ejected, & others called in their room.
+++ Various are the ways with which Infinite Wisdom sees meet to try us, to affect us, & to prepare us for the last great change, to which all other ^previous^ changes if sanctified by the Divine blessing will be happily subservient. ++++ Farewell
	Richard Shackleton
