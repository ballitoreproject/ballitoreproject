Richmond 15th of 8th mo (D's birthday) 1829.
My dearest Sarah
As I have a few moments to spare
I wish to dedicate them to thee, having much to say
to thee - & of various sorts. - In the first place I
felt very dull after thee the day thou left us. - I was
exceedingly sorry I had not fixed on going with
thee - but on many accounts James did not quite
approve of it - & I did not urge it - for which I was
very sorry after. - principally he disliked the
expense for so short a visit, & beside he thought
there were few now would care much to see me.
however it is past - & that visit that we have
both been longing for, for 6 years is paid - & alas
brought its sting with it. - You all do me a cruel
& shameful injustice in Ballitore - but I know
from experience that no assertions of mine can
clear me - for my word is not believed - however
I shall only say, that it is an unjustice & that it
will be long before I can forget the deep sense of
pain & sorrow that these suspicions have excited
in me. - - I am sure thou wilt be sorry & perhaps
surprised to learn that the result of my deliberations
has been to send in my resignation to the
monthly-meeting. - At thine - my uncle Harvey's &
Thomas's entreaties, I did pause, & reflect - & the
more I thought about it - the more earnest I became
they might have taken her with them - another sister would
have done so - but Hannah is Hannah to the last.
I have not heard a word from Ballitore, nor seen its
[unclear]post mark[/unclear] except on a Charity letter, since thou
went. - Willie runs about with the hand & has
quite got over the weakness of his ankles - I believe
the bathing & washing the ankle frequently in salt
& water & rubbing them well after were what
cured him. however it is a great comfort to me.
I hope thou wilt [unclear]shortly[/unclear] write to me - for I shall be
anxious to hear from thee - Do not forget thy promise
of coming next Christmas - it is now but 4 months off
& we should want thee badly. - I hope all thy little
ones are well & that dear icky [unclear]If chard[/unclear]  did not matter
the journey Farewell my dear Sarah
James sends thee his dear love
& that thy letter announcing the
safe conclusion of thy journey was
a most welcome one to him for
his conscience was not easy at letting thee go alone.
I am truly thy affectionate sister
LJ Fisher

to shew openly my total dis[unclear][/unclear] in sentiments
with those professing Friend's principles. Why should
I be constantly labouring to preserve my disguise
why should I be ever endeavouring to wear a mask
so cleverly, that all would suppose me to be different
from what I am - why must I appear to go against
my husband - when I so entirely go along with him.
& why need I submit to hear him reprobated to
my very face by those whom I know to be vastly
inferior to him in true principles of rectitude
& humility of heart - why must I bear all this
& more than I could tell? for I have endured more
than any body knows (for why should I tell it for
no one sympathises with me, but him), to preserve
the right of membership, to my children, in that very
body who believe that their father was not worthy
to be one of them! - but it is not that alone. Thou
will shrink from the manner that I have written
that I still feel indignation, anger & contempt
for the Limerick friends - indeed I do not. I give
them credit for honest motives & I firmly believe
they thought it their duty to act as they did. -
all I ask is permission to do so too. - I think, nay
I feel it my duty to act thus - & if I should
ever change my mind - I believe & hope that no
feeling of false shame would prevent me from
soliciting to regain my place in the Society &
the best proof I could offer for the truth of that
perhaps the work was too hard - The rest are in status quo.
I must now go & count the clothes so farewell & give my dear
love to Edward. I hear very little of him of late & he never sends
his love to me - -
Canst thou discover for me whether it would be worth my
while to get mercer dyed - I have curtains which are very
much faded & which I would like to get dyed either dark
green or blue. Also I wish to know are there any other
[insertion]colours[/insertion] but crimson dyed in [unclear]grain[/unclear] which would not fade in the
room there I slept in which has a deal of sun. -
I would be much obliged by Edwards sending me a box
of yellow soap - another of which - a box of kitchen
candles - another of [unclear]shers[/unclear] 6's for the parlour use -
If thou canst soon tell me about the mercer I will
send them up by boat in an old candle box if
they are worth the expense of dyeing. We hear
from [underline]the North[/underline] that George & Hannah are touring
through Wales & Scotland - but not one line from
them to either father or sister - they are a queer pair.
I think as they cannot have Sally visiting them in Ballitore

change would be my present [deletion]&[/deletion] painful sincerity.
Thou asks me would I act thus if our dear parents were
still living to influence us by their bodily presence.
& I answer freely, I would not if it would pain them
I would think any peace to my own mind too
dearly purchased by inflicting a pang upon them. -
but I think the case is quite different now - If they
are permitted still to observe or be interested in
human actions or in the conduct of those they have
left behind, they must see distinctly every beat in
the heart - every feeling & sensation of the mind. -
see all the one has borne, & see how the other [insertion]is[/insertion] influenced.
they must clearly see all, unbiased by human views, un-influenced
be reproached by a lamentation that I am their child.
There are a few that it [unclear]pains[/unclear]
me very much to think I am
afflicting by this step. Thyself
for instance, my aunt Sally - Betsy Shackleton
Betsy Barrington & my dear father & uncle & aunt
Harvey. - Oh! the kindness of my uncle - the gentle
& loving forbearance - I never will forget his & my
dear aunt's conduct in this trying affair, while I have
recollection of any event in my life, - nor the warm
& affectionate assurances of unweakened attachment,
interest, & sympathy, that they have showered upon me.
If all were like them I should be proud & glad to be
a quaker - I believe - But I should tell thee, what entirely
decided me. - I firmly believe that if these friends, knew
my sentiments entirely, they would not consider me
worthy to be one of them. I have no intention of giving
attendance of meetings of worship - I think it is
by human prejudices. - Oh! that I may never
a duty we owe to Society to attend some public place of worship
& that if it be possible to abstract the mind in a
public assembly from outward objects it may be beneficially
employed by reflecting upon the great object which has gathered
us there. - but I think private retirement - in the chamber
or amongst the works of our creators are the places best
suited for devotion. now thou knows all my dear sister
& I beg - nay entreat of thee to judge as favorably of me
as thou canst consistently with thy own different sentiments
& so I hope this painful subject is [unclear]dismissed[/unclear] from us
for ever.
My father & Sally are at Miltown - have been there
these three weeks past - we expect them back next
week. We have had very agreeable letters from Thomas
he likes his new situation & thinks his prospects favourable
The children are all well & hearty - Mary frequently
speaks of thy little Richard & invariably tells [unclear][/unclear]
that she [unclear]rocked[/unclear] him in the [unclear]cot[/unclear] - & whenever she finds
any thing is too small for our Willie's use she says it
will do "icky Richard" "aunt Sarra Barringtons child." My
domestic intelligence is nearly exhausted - except that
Margaret the [unclear]cook[/unclear] we had when thou wert here is gone at her own desire
