Coalbrook Dale 3rd month 21-1785


        I have not done justice to my feelings in letting my Dear Cousins obliging, and edifying letter lay so long unanswered  but as thou art no stranger to the language of the spirit, I trust thou will have felt me there where our friendship had its rise, for I have often with much sweetness recurd to those instructive seasons, when thy heart was enlargd in counsel and doctrine drop[^p]ed from thee as dew upon my drooping spirit  and may thankfully acknowledge it has been bread blest by the Master  that has returnd after many days, a desire accompaning [sic] that preservation might be mutually experienced, whereby we may continue to be as epistles writ in one anothers heartsthus far on my own account but I must not stop here, my Mother Darby, Sister & Darby, my Husband. I Appelby, with the rest of thy Friends, that shared the benefit arising from thy visit with Dear Anstis, & Molly, all join me in commemorating the season, and if we may but be kept through all trials, and conflicts, steady in our love to the best of Masters, I trust we shall meet again, with his blessing upon us, from whom every thing should receive its sweetness  
        My Mother Darby would inform thee, of my being absent at the time thy kind letter reached this place  being out accompanied by Rebecca Young on a visit to our poor 



I have had no private conveyance for the Manuscripts, but hope thou will favor us with as much of thy Company as thou can in thy way to & from London


Principallity [sic] and Herefordshire, the season was severe and many discouragements attend visiting the seed of the Kingdom, in its imprisoned state yet through the renewings of that help - which can alone make hard things easy, and bitter things sweet - we got along I hope with a degree of safety, and returnd home in peace after an absence of 9 weeks.
The account thou gives us of our Dear Friends now sojourners in your Land is satisfactory, it will be very acceptable to many of us on this side the water to have W. Bivington & J.Stephenson back, in the right time / please to give our dear love to them - if thou hast an opportunity / as also to see the Friends from the Continent in the ordering of wisdom -- we have lately experienced a time of great favor in having Patience Brayton and her Companion Margaret Brillitoe [illegible] under our Roof - for near 2 weeks. Patience being much fatigued with constant travilling [sic] found an engagement to stop here for a little rest, and indeed her visit has been memorable affording in many instances renewd proofe of revelation being still the ground of gospel Ministry  her exampleary [sic] deep dwelling, adorning her doctrine, and calling others to more inwardness she desired her dear love to thee thy Wife & Children  Nicholas Walne also paid us a short but acceptable visit, he seems much lead to people of other societys [sic] for which he has receivd a good gift -- 
I have only heard once from Dear MS[?] since you left us - but was glad by that account to find the cloud [?] seemd dispersd - and a confirmation granted - that her crossing the water was under right direction - how desirable to feel this to attend all our actions both small & great, which brings to my remembrance an expression in J. Woolmans journal. Remember Oh my Soul, the quietude of those in  whom Christ governs - and in all thy proceedings feel after it.
Thy Dear Daughter Molly is afresh in my remembrance with near affection - and a desire rests with me - that she may become so fully united to the suffering captive seed as to have her harp hung upon the willows 
Thy Dear Wife tho personally a stranger shares our esteem - because she is a traviller [sic] for Zions welfare - and Jerusalems prosperity - we are all favord with health - as also my Dear Parents & Ann Summerland - and uncle in dear love tothyself [sic] and each branch of thy family with A. Sparthes [?] which concludes me thy affectionate Cousin  Deborah Darby


A Receipt to make Cowslip Wine


When you have got as many pips as you intend to make use of, lay them to dry, to 6 gallons of water, put 6 gallons of pips, (and (so in proportion for a larger quantity), then put into it 15lb of course lump sugar; and the whites of 4 Eggs beat well, and put into it, boil it well up - taking off the scum as long as any appears, then add a handful of Balm - Sweet Bryar - and Margery, - After the herbs have boiled a little in it, strain it into a clean vessel and let it cool, put larm[?] to it, and let it stand 2 days, put the pips dry into the Barrel, skim the  





liquor well and put it in upon the pips. Take 4 Lemmons [sic] and 2 Seville oranges, peel, slice, and squeeze out the juices of them, some of the peel may be made use of, put to the juice 2 pound of loaf sugar, beating it well up together -- then put it into the barrel with a quart of brandy and a little [illegible - [?]sing] lass - stir it up every day for 9 or 10 days - then stop it up for a month or 6 weeks - then it will be fit for botling [sic] 





I omitted mentioning in its proper place that - Mother Darby - has been confind many weeks with a very bad cold but is now much better -- we hope thou will write. Mother is doubtful of her letter having reachd thee, as she hath had no answer -- we are not certain of our directing our letters properly
