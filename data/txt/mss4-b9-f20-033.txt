My dear E
I hear that I could get thy Parasol cover'd
with gingham for 2/8 I think it is hardly worthy
of silk, the new silk ones are so cheap
& that would do for the garden as well as
silk will it ever so well done it [unclear][/unclear]
[unclear][/unclear] cut a deal on account of its old fashion
say what shall I do by first of
we are all well but feel a little lonely
after all the sport we had.
ever thy SB
love to Elzth Davis
I saw M Doyle to day she has taken a bath
