My dear Father,

	I sent thee a long letter of my scribble a good while ago, but have not been favoured with hearing from thee since, & I have been the more desirous to hear from you, as thy last letter mentioned my sisters [sic] Sallys being much indisposed with pain in her head & jaw, & I have not heard since how she is, or how long she was thus afflicted, affliction of one kind or other we see is ^the^ lot of humanity, the family at Two-mile-bridge now taste the bitter cup, & as sister flattered herself with a hope that he might continue an ailing Man for many years, the stroke is more heavy upon her; an express left this last night with a letter to his & her friends in Dublin & I sent a few lines to thee to be dropped at the Head of the rode [sic], informing thee that our dear Brother John was rel^e^ased from this uncertain, Mortal state yesterday about one or two ^or three,^ oclock; he has been evidently declining fast since his return from the Northern, his breathing was very bad, & his flesh much reduced, his appetite was almost gone, he used to ride out on Horse ^back^ mostly every day, & was at meeting fifth day, but looked very ill, was very affectionate & gentle in his manner, & sat a while with us, I observed his breath exceedingly oppressed, & that he was extremely weak, but sister seemed endeavouring to keep up his spirit, & not so apprehensive of his danger, the evening of same day Brother Thomas & my Husband spent with him, & he seemed pretty cheerful & pleasant, & requested they would go oftener to him, next day they intended to go again in the afternoon, but just after dinner an alarm came of his being suddenly seized. I went down behind my Husband, & when we got to the house were informed, that he went out after breakfast to ride in ^his^ Chair with Betty Greer, that he went to a friends House in the country & took some refreshment there, on their return home Betty observed he did not speak to her, & found he leaned on her so heavy that she could not support him, the Man that led the Chair then went in (, & she came out & walked,) & supported him up, the servant says he put his arm round him & uttered these wordsWilliam I am Dead, & presently expired quite easy, without any struggle, or visible emotion, you may think what a shock it was to have him brought home dead to his Wife, & poor aged Mother, who was there at the time: they are both at present in deep affliction, & no wonder, for he was a truely [sic] fond, tender Husband, & very dutiful affectionate Son, he is much lamented, & particularly by the poor, to whom he was very charitable, he made good use of the means that was put in his Power, in relieving the wants of ^the^ Hungry & Naked, so that from taking a view of his watchful, exemplary, circumspect life & benevolent disposition, we have good reason to hope & believe, he is entered into that Rest prepared for the faithful & that his end was Peace. It is intended that his remains be interred here next second day, & that they leave the House at twelve oclock. I hope thou hast got my former letter, which expressed something of a wish to see thee here at that time. I own I find myself much affected, & distressed on this occasion. I had a letter lately from my sister Chandlee, & long to know how Janes leg is; our Sally had a lump on her back after the small pox, but by keeping a constant poultice of boiled bread & milk, & giving her a little gentle Physick it soon went off. I have been writing to our dear friend Elizabeth Pike before I wrote this, on this affecting subject, & have just scribbled those few lines to you. With my Husbands dear love joined with mineI conclude your loving
	& dutiful daughter
