Waterford Eighthmonth 17th 1788
My dear Molly's acceptable Letter conveyed
pleasing intelligence of her safe arrival & finding all
well at home — It is an encouragement to future rambles.
Thou may discover by the enclosure that the Doctor
is observant of the promises he makes to the [underline]Fair Sex[/underline]
notwithstanding they might casually intrude into the
walks of his Profession: 'Tis true there is no great
cause of jealousy when advice is only given to Paupers
as one of that description I return thee my grateful thanks
for thy kind prescription which I think is salutary.
I sometimes make use of the medicine thou recommends
but in a manner that I look upon to be less nauseous
I mean a little of the Tincture in a Glass of Water.
I applied to the Young man I told thee of on the subject
of the Letter who declared his utter ignorance of the affair
so sincerely that I must believe him. I do not see any
prospect in this quarter of discovering the writer, or

or knowing for certain if he confined himself to Truth.
I shewed the original to Pat Rogers who could not
unravel the mystery — Peggy is I believe quite
recovered. I inquired the Post office respecting
thy missing Letter to no effect as they could not
recollect any such but gave an assurance that they
must have been forwarded according to direction in due
course — I saw Polly Miller this day & would fain
have something from her to enclose but she had not
time She intends writing to some of the Family on
Third-day — Her Teeth have been troublesome to her.
I hope the Salt water agrees well with Sally. Is she
to stay long. I should be pleased to hear a more
favorable account from Sally Haughton.
Please present me affectionately to all branches
of the family & believe me
thine sincerely
William Rayner
