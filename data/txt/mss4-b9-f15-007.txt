Dear Sarah,
I received thy note a few
days ago for which accept my best thanks.
I got the other day a new volume of
Sermons by my favourite Chalmers, which, tho'
perhaps I dont [underline]admire[/underline] so much, yet I certainly
[underline]approve[/underline] more than any of the others.
The principle on which he goes is that "the
carnal heart is enmity against God," & that
even in the most apparently amiable characters,
all actions are sinful, unless
there has been a complete change in the
heart from its natural state. I have not
yet finished them; most of what I have read
I read to Mary Chandler who was also pleased
with them His arguments are so clear & convincing
& his style is impressive, that they
would I think make almost any reader sensible
of his utter depravity, & infernal nature.
unless he was a completely religious & devoted
character, & where are there such characters?

There must certainly have been a very great
change effected in his mind, when he was led
from the delusive notions of morality, inculcated
by "philosophy falsely so called," to seek
for [deletion]help[/deletion] forgiveness of past sins, & power to avoid
future ones, where alone they were to be found
in the great Atonement. - One of his sermons
on the Necessity of a Mediator is without exception,
the clearest & most satisfactory I ever
saw on the subject. - But enough of one subject. -
I am glad thou likes Madame de
Stael's work - she is certainly a charming writer;
I think the Edinburgh Reviewers say of her
that "she is the first writer of this age; & the
first female writer of any age" - perhaps the first
pair of praises is too great, but the last I certainly
think is not. - [deletion]I[/deletion] I saw Orpen & Gordon
at the Medical Society on seventh day evening.
The former lent me Joseph Humphrey's letter to read.
The latter [insertion](Gordon)[/insertion] I had no opportunity to offer more to than
a salute which I gave him on entering the room
in reply to his to me. I hope he has brought home
my Chalmers. - I was asking Joseph Fayle whether
he had yet fitted himself for thy conversation by
reading Cambrai, he said not, but he [underline]must[/underline] do so
before thou comes. I don't think he will. [unclear][/unclear]
pears too much occupied with [unclear][underline]material[/underline][/unclear]
to have leisure to season himself, [unclear]with[/unclear]
notion's [underline]spiritual[/underline] salt.- Thou agrees with
me in admiring Buxton's speech more than
any of the others in Parliament on the subject
of the Criminal Code. He appears to be [insertion]a[/insertion] practical[deletion]ly[/deletion]
as well as speculative advocate of
the cause of humanity, to have his heart as
well as his head in it. - I hope we
shall meet next week & talk about
such matters as I may omit to mention in
this note. - I paid the Deaf & Dumb
school a visit the other day & was recognised
by Brennan, after nearly a year's
absence, who exclaimed on my entrance
Doc - tor Fish - er. - Orpen came
in while I was there, which [unclear]was very[/unclear]
pleasant - they have not yet got a [unclear][/unclear]
Hoping to see thee soon
I am as usual
thine &c
Thomas Fisher.
