Clonmel 7th month 16th 1789

My dear Uncle

	I have felt almost ever since my return from England as if I wanted to write to thee or rather converse with thee for it ^was^ little matter how, if it was but brought about & yet for want of something to say I have forbore till now doing my part towards it
The sight of Cousin Abraham has been pleasant to many of this province  it has reminded ^me^ of his valuable father & by him I again tell thee that my love is strong for my friends, my beloved ^friends at Ballitore^ & deeply engraven upon my heart for thee my honoured kinsman & father in the church  This seems to comprehend all I had in view to say, for the secret enjoyment of gospel love & disinterested friendship have been since coming home as a brook opened by the way I trust in divine compassion (as even this good is not at our command) far as a father pitieth his children so the Lord pities them that fear him, because he knows our frame he remembered that we are dust.
It has been in diverse respects a low trying time to me since coming home: we have some painful prospects in this meeting  it seems as if the enmity early put between the seed of the woman & the seed of the serpent is stirred up ^by one or other^  Were it not that a renewed sense of divine omnipotence sometimes strengthens & reanimates the fainting ^mine^ we might ^conclude^ that the latter is to have the victory  I am not alluding to any person or circumstance  I earnestly desire to be preserved from wrestling with flesh & blood, knowing that in that sort of warfare the christian soul ^generally^ falls before its enemies, & if not, fails of wearing that crown of true rejoicing which is the consequence of having (through humble patient suffering) the name written in heaven  To keep the watch & in going down the stream of time to row against those head winds of principalities [?] of powers of the rulers of the darkness of this world & or spiritual wickedness in ^the^ high places of my own heart; is what most of all I desire to be exercised in, that whether the vessel be publickly used or not it, [sic] may nevertheless be brought into & kept in a state of sanctification & honour  Oh the danger there is in the present state of things of sitting down content with a superficial [word crossed out] sense of truth, judging after the sight of the eye & great is the mystery of godliness  The 

commandments of the Lord are exceeding broad as the natural man neither knows nor comprehends the purity of gospel truth & those ^who^ have experienced something ^of the renewing^ of the mind see but in part, what need ^have we^ to embrace every attractive influence to the Fountain of wisdom & strength, that our souls being poured into it like water, they may, thro holy conversion so assimulate [sic], as to live under the sense of & bear testimony to the eternal oneness & goodness of God, how little soever they may know besides.
I am now in the chamber of our beloved & sick friend M. Dudley whilst others are at meeting  She has been attending the quarterly meeting at Limerick & either thro fatigue or the criticalness of her situation (it being about that time of her pregnancy in which she was delivered of her little Thomas) she is now very ill with her old billious [sic] complaint & threatenings of other kinds  Her sickness I hope is not unto death but as in many other instances she suffers much & is a deserving object of the love & sympathy of her friends  I intend you shall be informed by somebody how it issues  She bids me tell thee that ill as she is she cannot help loving thee & also desires with me to be affectionately [sic] to dear Aunt & all other branches of the family
I have not been at Limerick where there such a group of the first rate folks so cannot give thee any plumb-cake from the feast  tis very likely that Abram has a list in his packet & as hes generously disposed like his worthy father thou stands a good chance of sharing with him  Our family such as were there came home alive & alive like for at the conclusion of the first meal they were at, A.B. & my R.G. saluted us beautifully & comfortably for as the indian [sic] ^said^ it was like cider it warmed my heart  This ^said^ Anne, notwithstanding her dismal ways is a choice upright hearted creature & when some of the probations peculiar to her ^present^ growth are profitably travelled through, she will I hope ^be^ an useful instrument in the church & reward her friends for their many anxieties respecting her  This S Lees thou knowst something of  She promises for being a strong fruitful tree in the Lords plantations  she depends with an instructive simpleness of her heart ^& conduct^ upon him alone
Farewel [sic] remember with fatherly ^care^ thy poor & often tried friend SRGrubb

So dear S.S. is not returned from Limerick  We hope you will not limit [?] her for time among her friends here
