My dear Cousin
I shou'd have acknowledged the
receipt of thy kind letter much sooner but was taken
up with company after my mother came home, &
since that have been about six weeks at the salt water
& came home last week, the place we were at is
a very pretty village called Rostrevor seven miles
beyond Newry, it commands a beautiful prospect
of the sea & shipping, is surrounded by delightful
mountains, & a variety of Gentlemens seats & neat
cabbins all with whitewashed walls and sash windows,
if they are not above six foot hight, but differs
much from Ballitore in regard to agreeable company,
for this place is the resort of all the Gentry from
Newry, & not a friend living near it. I suppose
you have been much taken up with the wedding,
& will be very dull after Sally Hall. I have m

some hopes of getting to see you at Ballitore
next summer but I am not yet certain whether
I will get leave or not. I am in haste so must
conclude with dear love to thy Aunt, Mother &
sisters also please to accept a large share thyself
from thy ever affectionate
cousin
