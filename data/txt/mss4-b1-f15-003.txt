A Dream the Morning of 16th of 1st mo: 1753.
I thought myself in a very large Inn, which was calculated
for the accommodation of a great number of Guests, & there were several
of our friends, who were divided into different companies;
& after I had been there some time in company with Jo: Barcroft,
I began to grow very uneasy & called to know what we
had to pay, and accordingly was informed of the charge, which
we concluded was most extravagant, upon which I urged Jo:
Barcroft to leave the house, who I thought at first seemed to
take little or no Notice of what I sa[deletion]ye[/deletion][insertion]i[/insertion]d to him, till I told him that
if we stayed much longer I was of opinion all we had in the world
would not clear us of that place. So we resolved to be gone: & as we
passed through another Room, which lay between us & the door,
I thought I saw Thos. Strangman & some other friend with him;
who were preparing to leave the place also, & on the floor at their
feet lay a large sum of money, which they had layed down in order
to defray their expence, & they seemed to be as uneasy to get away
as we were: & just as we were ready to be gone, I thought I saw
a very large-body'd strong-made old-man come into the room
& lie down on the floor by us, who made use of a great many gestures
& fawning kind of tricks in order to amuse [insertion]us[/insertion], that we might thereby
be detained longer in the place: at which I thought I was very
much displeased, & ordered him in an angry tone to be gone,
which he seemed to take little notice of, but got up off the floor &
sat down on a seat, & looked sternly at me, as if he bid me defiance:
which enraged me so, that I gave him two stroked over
the head with a large stick I had in my hand, as hard as I
was able, & in a great passion: which seemed to have no more
effect on him than if I had struck an Iron-Anvil: at which
I was a little surprised till I saw on the front-part of the top
of his head a large, round lump of hard consistency, like a
bone: which convinced me that he was not to be overcome in
that manner, but he was so enraged that he rose upon his feet
& made a stroke at my head: which I defended with the stick I had in

in my hand, so that he did not hurt me; & then he withdrew in
great rage & many threatenings of revenge against me; so I thought
I got out of the house; & as I passed along, I discovered that I had
left most of my cloaths behind [insertion]me[/insertion], & was almost naked: which at
first I thought was some loss to me, but was afterwards better
satisfied when I saw the same old-Man on the other side of a
strong hedge, at the foot of a St[deletion]y[/deletion][insertion]i[/insertion]le lying in wait for my coming,
who as soon as he espied me made great haste to get over the
st[deletion]y[/deletion][insertion]i[/insertion]le to pursue me - I then thought it was well I had left my
cloaths behind [deletion]me[/deletion], lest they should retard my flight; & was preparing
to make my escape, when I saw an orderly kind of a
Woman, who seemed concerned at the danger I was in; & bade me
fly for my life; for that old man was a common enemy to the
whole country & had done much mischief thereaway, so I thought
I began to run, & my enemy pursued hard & seemed to gain ground
on me, & I ran very heavily & almost out of breath, & was in great
dread of being overtaken by him, & so ran on till I came to a place
where there were three path-ways, one of which turned short on the
left hand & led almost back to the house I had quitted; at first
I had a mind to take that road; but on second thoughts concluded
it best to take one of the other two, which went strai[insertion]gh[/insertion]t forward
& seemed to lead much one way, & pretty close together, only divided
by a large, double ditch; the one on the left side seemed most
beaten, which at first made me incline to choose that, but at length
resolved to choose the path on the right hand, & perceiving the old-man
had almost overtaken me, I began to mend my pace, &
found the longer I continued in that path the faster I ran &
with more ease, though at the first [insertion]entrance[/insertion] I had like to have tripped
up by small tufts of briars, which were in the way; so I still
continued running till I had left the old-man a great way
behind & almost out of sight, and at length overtook a Woman
on horseback, who was most gaudily drest with all sorts of rich
and costly attire, who perceiving me close at her horse's heels began
to amuse me with discourse till the old-man was almost up
with me again; which as soon as I perceived (made me (tho' with

with some difficulty, the path being very narrow) get by the Woman
on horseback, & run more swiftly & with much more ease than
I had done before: & just as I passed her I thought she complained
of the narrowness of the way: to which I replied the way was a
good way for foot-passengers, but not fit for Coaches, or any sort
of carriages; so I thought I continued running very swiftly till
I had left both her & the old-man a great way behind, & at
length came to a River; which I had to cross; on the other side of
which & on the top of a hill, stood a very beautiful small town,
I thought I immediately without hesitation went into the River,
the deepest part of which did not reach higher than my Loins.
& the water was so clear I could see the smallest grain of sand
at the bottom: & when I had got almost over, I saw two or three
Soldiers ready to receive me & conduct me up the hill into the
Town - I thought I perceived that they knew very well the circumstances
I was in, & seemed mightily pleased at my escape
from the old-man; I looked at them earnestly, & found something
in their countenances which looked very solid, & not like the common
soldiers in any respect; but one of them I thought looked
more solid than the rest, who told me that he well knew
the old-man who pursued me, & that he had often been grievously
attacked by him: So I thought we continued going strai[insertion]gh[/insertion]t
forward up the Hill till we entered the Town, when I cast
my eyes on one side & saw in a remote corner a little habitation,
which I had some knowledge of, having lodged there
for a short space some time before: from which place a
person came to me; & ask'd me if I would not take up
my quarters at my old lodging: to which I made no reply,
nor took little Notice of, but still continued going on till
I came to the top of the hill, which was the middle of the
town, where I saw many of the soldiers who looked very solid,
but all seemed pleased at my escape, which I perceived
they were sensible of: so I went on with the soldiers,
who conducted me from the river till they brought me to

to their barrack, or place of residence, which was very beautiful & well-secured,
as I thought, from any attacks of the old-man, in case he
should come there, which made me resolve to take up my residence
amongst them: so I thought I looked round about me
and had a most delightful prospect of a beautiful country,
the extent of which was boundless; & the town I thought was
very regular, the buildings very neat, but not Magnificent,
nor too close together: & above all I thought I liked the company
of the Soldiers, who all seemed to be men of great
solidity; & though they were all cloathed like officers,
there was no distinction of titles amongst them, but all
bore the name of Soldiers; so as I was standing amongst
them contemplating on what I saw, I thought I espied
the old-man walking to & fro; but in disguise, he having
cast off the fierceness of his looks, & seemed much less as to
his stature, & appeared in some measure [deletion]as[/deletion] [insertion]like[/insertion] a plain, ancient friend
notwithstanding which I knew him & [insertion]also[/insertion] found that he was [insertion]well-[/insertion]known
to all the soldiers, who seemed to watch him very narrowly, lest
he should come behind their backs & do them a mischief,
which I found they were very apprehensive of: & tho' I
was quite out of fear of his attacking me in that place
in a violent manner, yet I found it as necessary to watch
his motions, as the Soldiers did.
So I awoke.
