[underline]April 13th 1867[/underline] Onboard the Sophia Steamer
on the Danube
[underline]My dear Elizth[/underline] I believe I shd not address one line to
your own self since I left home - I hope you do not
think I am ungrateful for all you have done for
me in the writing way by this seeming neglect
for indeed I am not I considered all I wrote to my
mother was to you also & trust you have so taken it
I wrote last from Vienna where we made only a short
stay tho' had circumstances permitted I would have
liked very well to [insertion]have[/insertion] stayed there a few days - I like it bette[unclear][/unclear]
than any [underline]Town[/underline] I was in since I left home but
Thos did not like to stay as we were rather peculiarly
uncircumstanced which in hold some degree prevented
our doing just as we liked - The gentleman we
met in the Railway from Prague to Vienna - Count
Mariolini was as I told you very kind & friendly
to us and not only called himself the following
day but brought his lady to visit us - we were
out & therefore did not see them - but we knew
from this and his manner to us that he wished

to pay us more than common complimentary
attention & that we would have been invited to go
to more expense than we thought is prudent as
we had not even clothes fit to return then [unclear]but[/unclear]
having brought nothing whatever we could avoid
& just making the one carpet bag do the three of
us - we had succeeded when we were out in getting
all that was necessary done about our passport
and also found that the Steamer up the Danube
& for Lintz started next morning (& wd not do so again
until Wednesday) we thought it better to start too
as the time is drawing near for being home &
Thos wished much more for the fine scenery than
seeing the finest City in the world - so we started
at 8 on Monday morng leaving a note to be sent
to the Count apologizing for not calling on him
and a most delightful days sail we had the
weather was fine and the scenery fine indeed
and I think you have something to see yet in
not having been on the Danube yet - but then
I suppose the Rhine is as fine if not finer & that
you have seen - the worst of it was that the most
picturesque part we came to was in the dark for
we staid all night on board the Steamer wh did not
stop until it could not help it - very much to our
annoyance and I believe only to ours as we were
the only persons on board to whom it was new all
the rest which were a good many both ladies & gentlemen
were only travelling to get from one place to another
over scenes familiar to them & were anxious to get
to their journey, and [unclear][/unclear] the hills through where
the river runs which are most picturesque clothed
to the top in some places with trees or vineyards and
surmounted with monasteries or Castles or Ruins,
we had a fine view several times of the Snow
covered mountains of Styrian Saltzberg Alps - this
scenery being very cold with frost the scenery
somewhat tamer I came down to rest awhile
in the cabin & thought I would just write a few
lines to have ready to send from some convenient
place - we expect to be at Lintz before ten oclock
& whether we remain there a day or go on
in Steamer to Ratisbon at once I do not yet
know - There are five or six ladies lolling along
on the sofas who when I began to write & long after

gabbling as fast as ever their tongues could go in that
discordant jargen German - they seem to be tired
& are now dosing - one only knitting & one reading
Besides all the gentlemen & Ladies that are on [unclear]board[/unclear]
there are a great number of the lower classes
of whom are picturesque enough - there is not
one on board who speaks English except one of
the second cabin passengers - who as we were walking
about deck accosted us seeming pleased to hear in
native language - we arrived at Lintz in due
time & finding that the steamer went no farther
that day we went to a Hotel and had breakfast
or mid day meal - washed and settled ourselves
& went out about our Passports & - and to see
the town - and fixed that instead of going on
direct to Ratisbon we should diverge [insertion]as fas as[/insertion] to Saltzburg
and see some of the fine scenery in that neighbourhd
but there was no way of getting on that day so we
walked to some of the heights above the town from
which we had verry fine views the day was most
delightful - not a breath of wind & the sun very hot
we sat on the grass on top of one of the cliffs high
high over the Danube - so steep that we could almost have

dropped a stone into the river yet so high we could scarcely
distinguish the people below so as to tell their dress - here we
lunched on bread & apples - I need not attempt to describe
the scenery - Murray tells you better than I could what
[unclear]is[/unclear] to be seen - when we tired ourselves walking we returnd
to our Hotel which fronted the river and from the window
of which we looked out on a very lively scene - we had
tea very good and then went to the theatre which is
only open from seven until nine oclock - we went to
bed early as we were to be up at five to go by railroad
to Gruunden - just as I was ready for bed I found
what we had not before met with - Bergs! I was in a fine

fright and thought I should not sleep at all - however
Thos & Mary & I set about searching for them and having
clearest our every [unclear]justly[/unclear] well we went to bed - [unclear]Murray[/unclear]
a candle lighting and I tied up the buttons of my
night dress and lay with my arms outside and
escaped! - we were up at 4 oclock & off by Railroad or tram
road (for the carriages are drawn by horses) to Lambach, we
went in the second class and were pretty tightly packed
with five other persons - but tho' they were what is called
the lower order they were decent people - and we
were a good deal amused by them - there was a woman
delicate looking after first confinement - her mother
carried her infant of 16 days old wrapped up in the way
peculiar to this country & which I suppose you have seen
they found they had [underline]by mistake[/underline] taken first class tickets
so after coming about 1/2 way with us they got out & joined
the fair class carriage for the remainder of the way - 
We had a man & his daughter - the man smoked most
of the way but the wind favored us & we were not [unclear][/unclear]
annoyed by it - the girl had a necklace of some sort & rows
of pearls fastened by a broad gold clasp - and on her fingers
12 rings - a woman who seemed more respectable than
any of the above mentioned made up our [unclear]winter[/unclear]
we breakfasted at a very comfortable Inn at Lambach
in Coffee and Eggs bread, butter, and had a most beautiful
day - 

we were very much amused at one place we
stopped in the train to see the passengers buy bread
and sausages the latter quite hot were carried about
in vessels suited to keep them so and were taken in the
hands and thrown into the lap or stuffed into the pockets
until they were to be eaten - then a long shiny of them
taken out and bit about with the bread - they put
me in mind of a robin eating an earth worm -
I have filled my paper my dear Elizth and fear
you will be scarcly able to make it out and that
you will find it little worth when you do - with
dear love to Richd Florence Thy Mother Aunt & Manliff
 ever yours EH
