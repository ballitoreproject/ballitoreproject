Sir
When I last had the pleasure of seeing you, I was too
much Embarrassed, upon reflecting on the great loss of time.
I had fruitlessly lost, endeavouring to bring our little
affairs to a Course of paying you, & of being further serviceable
to my Bror: & myself, to have thought of telling
you, my then intention was to go to America as a
Volunteer, which I have since put in Practice, got a
Commission in the 71st Regt:, been Ordered home wth:
Invalids, & now put on Half pay. -
And for want of somewhat agreeable to say relative
to your Demand, I should rather at present forbear
writing, did I not fear my silence might be attributed
to some contrary motive.
My Bror. & I are in Dublin, & intend to take
our papers out of Aldermn: Hamilton's hands, thro'
whose Bror's:, & his own indolence, you, & us, have been
greatly injured, & we purpose as soon as our Affairs
are Arranged, to lay a state of them before you, & put
you in such a Course of paymt:, as they will admit of;
I hope Mrs. Shackleton, yr. Son & Daughter in Law, Mr. &
Mrs. Grubb, Mr. & Mrs. Chandlee & their families are well &
likewise Misses Molly & Sally & that you may believe me
yr. respectfull, hble Servt.
