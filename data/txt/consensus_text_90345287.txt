I fear there would have been little use
So what with Ellen and her I was easily tempted
to absent myself also - a shame I suppose
no I dont suppose it - my conscience does [insertion]tho' a member[/insertion]
not prick me much I think. [insertion]Tho' a member[/insertion] I am
not yet convinced of the actual use of
the "circle" as it is called - perhaps owing
to my ignorance. Tho' nearly a year
organized they seem to have but little
to show - I expect Polly and I H tomorrow
12th. Well they came this morning &
Uncle Francis with them. Margt had
gone to meeting so there was only poor
me to receive them and give them
their breakfast. Polly seemed to have
enjoyed their visit to quiet little Ballytore:
tore: they lodged with Polly and Elizabeth
[extra line]
they lodged with Sally and Elizabeth
but spent their days with Betsy Barrington
I belive. She seemed a little better they said
after breakfast. T, H, Polly and I set
out on a shopping expedition treating
ourselves to a comfortable cab, as time
was short and shopping was long
