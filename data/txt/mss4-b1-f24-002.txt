I had but just time to take a view of this fine room before a
number of persons richly dress'd passed us, who smelt so strong of
brimstone that I seemed almost suffocated: everyone were talking
to themselves, & at a distance to us looked well; but when
they came near, there appeared blackness on every face: those
that did not talk loud moved their lips, & seemed to mutter
to themselves; which was also the manner of some who
walked alone. I was seized with horro[insertion]u[/insertion]r & asked my guide,
"what is this place, & what are these"? he answer'd, "these are
"miserable for ever: they were, when in the body, in tumults
"& will be so everlastingly": at some distance sat an old
gentlewoman in a chair, a fine person, very white or powder'd
and grandly dressed. I made up to her, to see if there was
the same appearance of misery in her. I was more shocked
than before; for her lips were moving, & from her eyes
came small flames of fire: & a little after I looked round
& there appear'd in my view a [underline]woman-friend[/underline] plainly
dressed, & a green apron. I remember'd her well; when I was
young, I often took notice of her for the solidity of her deportment,
particularly in Meeting. I eagerly made
up to her & said, "What? art thou amongst the miserable?
"tell me, tell me what brought thee hither."
She wept & said, "no wrong that I have done between
"man

"man and man, but unfaithfulness & disobedience to my God brought
"me hither." I thought I wept much, as well as she: when I first looked
[insertion]on her she looked[/insertion] sorrowfully. I then turned to my guide, & said, "Let me go": he walked
slowly forward & met so many like the others in appearance
& smelt so strong that I seemed almost suffocated with
brimstone. I thought in the bitterness of my spirit that
I said to my guide, "am I to remain here fore ever"? I thought
"ere a little time passed I had secur'd an inheritance amongst
"the first we saw": my guide stood and looking [insertion]stedfastly[/insertion] on me, Said,
"thou art not to remain here, but to return to the world again:
"but if thou art faithful to thy God, thou may'st
"have an inheritance amongst the first: but I have something
"else to shew thee": he went a little farther: then appear'd
another arch, which divided this place from a larger
one like a Chapel, wherein abundance of persons were
assembled workshipping and saying, "Amen, Lord have
"mercy on us! Christ have mercy on us"! these appeared more
plain in their dress and look'd whiter. I said to my guide,
"these are not miserable sure." He said, "these are miserable:
"these are they that thought to be sav'd by a profession
"of religion, but had not the white robes of righteousness.
"they all came in by way of this town: some stopt among
"the Worshipers, others went on to those who smelt so
"strong of brimstone": my distress was now greater than
before; for I thought I knew some of those, and they looked
at me, as if they knew me; and though[deletion]t[/deletion] they look'd as
if

if they worship'd, they look'd to[deletion]o[/deletion] and fro and seem'd discompos'd.
I again entreated my guide to let me go: he walk'd gently
out of this, and came to the entrance of this house which
was large, with a wide gate: here stood a number of persons
in black cloaths, who did not seem to move to the
others. When we came to the outside of the gate, I saw
an intimate friend whom I much lov'd: [this friend
died in about a month after,] coming towards the gate, &
two persons conducting him; he look's sorrowfully on
me, and I on him. I asked him, "art thou going amongst
the miserable? what is thy offense? what hast thou done?
"tell me": he answer'd, "beware of covetousness and the
"love of money, that brought me hither": we both wept
much, and were greatly troubl'd: but I wanted to be
gone, and follow'd my guide, and on looking back saw
some persons pulling and others rushing on him: we
were now in a large inclos'd field, out of which I cou'd
see no road; but my guide had me to a place where
there was just room to go out: he stood and look'd at
me earnestly, and said, "thou art going into the world again:
"remember what thou hast seen: 'tis not enough
"to be honest to man, thou must be honest and faithful
"to thy God": but this and the returning into the world
again affected me much; for it seem'd a matter of doubt
wether I should be able to steer my course so as to
be

be worthy of admittance amongst the first I had a sight of
but standing speechless, and my guide standing still, faith
suddenly sprang up in my heart, and I seem'd to say these words
"Lord! thou canst, if thou wilt, preserve me through them." I
awak'd, but the horro[insertion]u[/insertion]r I was in I am not capable of expressing
I seem'd as if I fetch'd my breath in a room where brimstone
& sulphur were burning, often saying to my nurse, and those
about me, that I seem'd as if the smell of brimstone was
in my stomach: and I really thought I could not live
many hours, nor do I believe I shou'd, if the Almighty,
in the extendings of his boundless goodness, had not had
regard to me a poor, unworthy mortal, and caus'd that
suffocating smell to pass from me, and gave me to trust
in his name, that melted my heart before him, & enabled
me to vent my sorrows in many tears: after which my troubled
mind was favourd with a calm.
