Richmond 9th of April 1824
My dearest Sister
You will readily pardon
me that I have not before this time attempted to assure
you with my own pen of my most lively sympathy
with your affliction for your recent heavy
calamity, when I say that I rather kept back my
letter in kindness to you as I well know that the
first burst of violent grief finds its readiest consolation,
not in the officious interference of comforters but
in [deletion]the[/deletion] quiet indulgence - And besides my dear Sarah
I knew you would be anxious to hear of the effect
which the first intelligence of such an unlooked-for &
grievous event would have on dear Lydia - We did
not venture to communicate it to her until this evening
fearing her strength would not be equal to the blow, for
we knew she would feel it deeply for as she said herself
he had been a dear kind friend to her - and not only
for herself [insertion]would she feel[/insertion] but for every individual of his family -
She was very much affected indeed as I had expected, but
as I was careful [deletion]in[/deletion] [insertion]not to[/insertion] break[deletion]ing[/deletion] on her suddenly with the full

truth I hope she has not suffered any injury from the
shock - (for shock it must be, however gently revealed-) save
the weight left upon her mind from thinking of your irreparable
loss - Most sincerely do we all feel for you
my dear Sister & we experience[deletion]d[/deletion] a gloom which has changed
our recent joy into an humbler feeling - Lydia & the little
babe are as well as possible, he with considerable appetite
for nourishment & she with ability to afford it to him, is
happy in performing all the duties & experiencing the pleasures
of a mother - Joseph is quiet & disturbs [insertion]her[/insertion] very little if any
in the night time - he [deletion]slept[/deletion] sleeps a great deal & does not
cry much - This contributes much to her recovery - We have
her sitting up in her easy chair every day for eight or nine
hours & we hope soon to have her in the parlour - She looks
well & handsome and exceedingly like dear Deborah now that
she is feeble & requires support as Deb used to do, but which
thank Heaven & Lydia Sarah [insertion]Deborah[/insertion] she is now so well able to do
without - It is very refreshing to hear such excellent accounts
of dear Deborah's reinstated health - after so many
years of suffering & such alternations of hope & fear - Ah,
how our pleasant anticipations often turn to woe - there
was poor Eben hoping to see Edward & your dear lamented

father in London and that hope is met by the unexpected melancholy
news - We were obliged to conceal so many letters
from Lydia & so "to coin our cheeks to smiles" in her presence
& her strength increasing so much, that we feared it was
dangerous almost wrong to conceal any longer from her
the dreadful truth and as it has proved, it is better & safer
that she knows all - We had concealed from her even
the tidings of little Gurty Downes's decease, which I told
her today when I knew that the fulness of her grief did
not leave room for a minor sorrow to injure her - She
desires her most dear love to you
& Edward & Eliza & your poor Mother,
with the keenest expression of her
sympathy for your sorrow - in all
of which from my heart I join her - She begs you will
mention our dear little niece in your next letter & let
that my dear Sarah come soon -
You will be pleased to hear that we have letters from Thomas
who is settled comfortably in lodgings in Basinghall Street & has met
with much kindness & encouragement from William Allen, John
Hodgkin, William Phillips, the Forbes & other friends -
Your sincerely affectionate brother
S.J.Fisher
