a letter from Margt this morning

Who should appear towards tea-time

13 Wednesday - This day being very fine
and mild, Polly after considerable
debating arranged to drive over to Orange
Hill in the phaeton, bringing with her
baby and nurse - so they left this
at about 2 O'clock - so I have

Took a walk and a sketch after
dinner - and spent a very quiet
evening, working writing and reading.

there had been [underline]awful[/underline] floods in Kerry,
