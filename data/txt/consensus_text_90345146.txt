paid us a visit this morning
and made an apology for sending
us word when we called "that they
were just going out" - as indeed
they were., but Mrs Kift said if they
had known who it was she would
have seen us herself. They invited
us to spend the evening there, but
as I was coming out here of course
I could not go - Polly and Charlie
were to have done so, but whether
they did or not, I am not yet
sure. Aletia Frague and a priest
sure. Aletia Frague and a friend
[extra line]
of hers called to see Margt. after dinner
but did not stay long, not finding
her at home. Papa, Ellen and I
drove out here to tea, the rain came
on when about half way, and
heavily enough to give us a good
wetting which made us enjoy a
hot tea and cheerful fire.
Margt and Liddy are at present
at Glendruid where the car left.
