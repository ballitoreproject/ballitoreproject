Well my kind friend, I am much obliged to thee for
the loan of thy Mare; she carried me safe & well - As Joseph
Walpole is not at home I thought best to [insertion]send[/insertion] her by the Bearer, who
I expect will take care of her - I was detained at Medlicotts
he not being at home when I called, so lay in Portarlington
last night & came from thence here this morning - All
our family well, & with love to yours I am thy
affectionate friend
