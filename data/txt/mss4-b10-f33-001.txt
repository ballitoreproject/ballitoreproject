My dear Cousin
I recd thy welcome letter with great pleasure
& now write to ask thee how wd thou like to have
thy little portion convey'd to thee it is now
in Edws hands & we wait for thy directions respecting
it, I was sorry I again miss'd seeing Robt.
[unclear]Mcken[/unclear] & thy nice granddaughter; I have not
seen Sally yet I hear she has return'd from
Ballitore, Do not blame RD Webb about the apparent
neglect of thy commission, he certainly shd
have answer'd thy letter, he could not procure
the books thou wish'd for, indeed I am quite disappointed
on looking over my own books to find
I have not those thou mention'd as I intend'd
sending them to thee as a loan, I think I had all
my dear mother's works at one time, but somehow
or other they have almost all left thro'
my fingers I do not think there is a [unclear]kept[/unclear] principle

amongst people respecting books they borrow
freely & return in a most niggardly manner
the Cottage Dialogues have been reprinted lately
with the addition of a third part & I wish to send
thee a copy [unclear][/unclear] shall I give it to E Yeates for
thee? Thou must feel a little lonely after
thy friends at the Groves I hope this change
may be a good one in every respect &
am glad to hear that the interesting [deletion]Eliza[/deletion] [insertion]Maria[/insertion] has
got an agreeable [unclear]pastime[/unclear] - I suppose Sally
has written a full & true account of Ballitore
to thee in it's present [unclear]stript[/unclear] state it has
undergone various alterations since thou knew
it first I believe none much for the better
& it has considerably degenerated since I
knew it first, my aunt still continues to creep
about with her old attendant Mary S is quite
an Invalid I may say she bears her sufferings
heroically she was a fine active useful

creature & now she can hardly use any exertion
 without injury to herself which to one of her [unclear]former[/unclear]
habit seems to be one of the greatest trials she
could be subjected to Betsy is her kind & anxious
attendant, Richd is amusing himself in the
South & has been there for more than 3 months
[unclear]R S Leadbeater[/unclear] & his amiable wife are very well
she hopes to increase her family in the course
of a few months, he is busy as ever delving
away in the mine of business & bustle looking
for ore with but little success - Thos & Elizt Cole
are living in Dublin now, Thos has got nine pupils
& they have let part of their house which makes
to rent come [unclear]easier[/unclear] to them & I hope they will
succeed in their undertaking few are so
generous & open hearted as Elizth & her husband
does not control her - I have scribbled away
without paying enough of attention to my writing
which I fear thou canst hardly read. thou

must employ the [unclear][/unclear] eyes of thy fair granddaughter
on this occasion, I must now bid thee adieu telling
thee what I am sure will gratify thee that we are
all very well I hope thou hast the same to tell
me in return, I wd like to hear of Richd I believe
he is but a slow correspondent, I hope we shall
all be favour'd with a portion of tranquility
in our later days at present there seems
room for nothing but hurry & bustle at least
it seems so with me I sometimes say to myself
shall I ever have time to die? or rather time
to live so as to be able willingly to obey the
last call - Thou art my encouraging example
I often think of thy happy cheerful
temper which has received good & evil with
calmness & faith taking all for good what
a precious state of mind is this! now
my dear Cousin farewell I hope ever to be
from thee in thy affe. [unclear]S[/unclear] Barrington
