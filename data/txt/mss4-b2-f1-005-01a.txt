My dear James
        ++ I remained at Kilconner & in the neighbourhood till I saw the last of poor, dear Robert Watson [name written over in pencil] - I saw him die, & saw his remains interred - he died I hope in the death of the righteous, as the symptoms which attended him, the good fruits which he brought forth at the close copiously & plainly manifested.
