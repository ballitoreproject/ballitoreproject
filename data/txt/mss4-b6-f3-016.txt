March 8th 1811
I am much obliged to you, my dear friend
For your kind letter, or rather note I should say; when the
letter was handed to me I promised myself much pleasure
from the perusal of a long letter but you may suppose how
much I was disappointed to find only a few lines from you
& my dear Betsy. However even the few lines were very
acceptable as I was very anxious to hear about Lydia -
I fear you have little to hope, yet.
from amidst affliction's night
Hope bursts all radiant to the sight
Her words the troubled bosom sooth.
It is natural for us always to hope the best, but I must
confess I think you cannot expect her recovery. Her long illness
will prepare you for what I think we have too much
reason to fear will happen, but even long illness will not
reconcile you to part with her - It requires so much fortitude
to bear the constant and anxious attendance on those
we love, thro' a lingering illness in which we are still
deceived by hope, that I fear Betsy's health will be materially
injured - I would write to Betsy if I did not think
my letters too trifling to engage her attention now- I could
not avoid mentioning my fears about Lydia to her, & if she
has any hopes I would not like to destroy them - & if I
wrote on indifferent subjects she might well suppose me
unfeeling; this would indeed be very far from being the

case as I have felt too much on the illness and death of
some of my dearest relations, not to feel for her. Tell her I
I have received her letter by James Christy - and that my Father
has sent Lancaster's lessons with the last Magazines. I
was very busy the morning the lessons were sent & I
begged my father would write [insertion]a[/insertion] few lines to her in my
place, & he, with his usual wish to gratify me, complied -
I cannot say any thing favorable of my Father's health
but I think his illness entirely proceeds from the rheumatism -
He looks ill but his spirits are as good as usual
& I hope if the weather was a little milder he could
with care, soon recover his usual health. We have been
very uneasy about Betsy - she has had a severe cough
for several weeks; we have now got her muffled in flannel
and I hope we shall be able to remove her cough soon -
she always thought herself uncommonly strong & that
it would be almost impossible to injure her health - I think
this has tended very much to make her delicate
My father got the agent for forwarding the Magazines
to write to Lees about charging so much for the
Magazines & to say that they would not be sent by post
unless he [unclear]preoarded[/unclear] them at 20d per number - He gets them from
the magazine proprietors at 15 - He replied he would forward
them as formerly - my father desires me to tell you not to
say more than 20 as he thinks Lee's will try to impose
on you again -
William Lefanu's paper will be
in the next magazine; we have got a great number of
schools on Lancaster's plan in the neighbourhood - Our
little school improves every day - we are accused of making
our girls [underline]too conceited[/underline], this would be a heavy [insertion]charge[/insertion], if I thought

it well founded, but I cannot think that cleanliness and
tidiness is conceit - & I must confess that when I see the
miserable & dirty houses of the poor, I wish to make the
children at our school neat both in their dress & in their
houses. I am such an advocate for tidiness in all
ranks that [insertion]much as[/insertion] I dislike conceit, I would rather see people
conceited than slatterns. If the cloathes of the poor are
ever so old, they look much better when they are well
mended, & for this reason we are very careful to teach
the children at our school to mend their cloathes - We
are also in the habit of calling at their houses, & they are
always anxious to have the place clean lest we should
not give them a premium for cleanliness - Excuse me
if I tire you on this subject -
Have you ever read the life of Dr. Beattie?
I have just been reading it. I always admired his Minstrel,
but I think his pension from government made him
too obsequious. We are quite in a bustle here
about poor Finnesty; my Father is quite enthusiastic
about him. He is endeavouring to raise a subscription
to defray the expense of his prosecution, & to support him
in gaol; as his chief support was [insertion]derived from[/insertion] writing news for the
news-papers he must now be deprived of that means of
subsistence - & another reason, perhaps stronger with
my Father, is that by supporting those who are prosecuted
for libels, the people will convince those despicable, &
mercenary agents of government who wish to shackle the
press, that if they oppress, the liberal & enlightened will
support. You will perhaps think I am too violent in politics

& indeed it is not a study I particularly admire, but it [deletion]is[/deletion]
would be quite impossible for me to be so much the companion
of my father, & not to enter into all his studies
with interest - & Finnery has a particular [unclear]claim[/unclear] on the
Irish. I am very glad to hear that Deborah likes
Mountmellick - she will I am sure be very anxious about
Lydia. Indeed every one who knows her must be uneasy
I fear she was injured by the application of that large blister -
Dr. Crawford, a physician [insertion]on[/insertion] whom we have great dependance,
[deletion][/deletion] often told me that when a person was very weak never
to suffer a blister to stay on more than three hours, merely
to let the skin be a little irritated - I am very sure that it
must weaken very considerably to let a blister remain on for
several days - Is Elizabeth at home? Please give my love to S.
Shackleton & tell her I am much obliged to her for the message
in Betsy's letter - I shall not send any more [underline]love[/underline]
as you may be convinced that I love you all, but
I dislike the formality of sending it - Your very
affectionate SH
