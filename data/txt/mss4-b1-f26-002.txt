My feeling & sentiments of friendship
are much above my outward condition,
& tho' I do not murmur, I am almost
tempted to it when I consider what opportunities
it deprives me of enjoying in the
company of my dearest friends; & how little
I can help those in distress, for whom I feel
the deepest sympathy. Think of this & be
thankful, you whose lot is in a southern
land, yes, & let me consider it & be thankful
too, as appointed by him who is only
wise. For these light afflictions are but
for a moment, & truly my mind is frequently
raised above them, looking forward in
hope towards that blessed state, when all
the baneful shackles of mortality shall
be put off; & the children of the kingdom
be put off; & the Children of the kingdom
meet in him, who is the center of unity
meet in him, who is the center of unity,
beyond the limits of time & space, no more
to be separated.
John Thorp

Extract from a letter of Dr. Fothergill
to a young Phy[insertion]si[/insertion]cian.
I wished at my first setting out, most
fervently & I endeavour after it still, to do
the business that occurred, with all the diligence
I could, as a [underline]present duty[/underline], & endeavoured
to repress every rising idea of
its consequences, knowing most assuredly,
that there was a hand which could easily
overthrow every pursuit of this kind, & baffle
every attempt either to acquire fame or wealth
And with a great degree of gratitude I look
back to the gracious, secret preserver, that
kept my mind more attentive to the discharg
of my present, anxious care, than either to
the profits or the credit resulting from it:
& I am sure, to be kept under such a circumscribed,
unaspiring temper of mind, doing
every thing with diligence; humility, & as
in his sight, frees the mind from much unavailing
distress, & consequential disappointment.
