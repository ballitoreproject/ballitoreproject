Ballitore 9th of 2nd mo
My dear Lucy
R.S.L. came quite
unexpectedly yesterday from
Carlow, whether he had gone
to obtain a certificate of his
membership from the mo:
meeting [insertion]in[/insertion] order to presenting
his marriage next 3rd day;
he took Sarah with him,
this morning, & she requested
I would inform thee lest
thou shouldst be expecting
her next week, but she
hopes to pay thee a visit
on her return. I think

Sarah very far from well;
her head quite ill when she
left us this morning; change
of air & scene I trust
will benefit her - as Patty
Stephens is at her house;
her mind is easy about
the children. It affects me
very much to see her so
ill - I have already lost
one beloved younger sister
& I cannot suppress my
fears that I may soon
have to mourn another,
& Sarah is very dear to me.
Poor Edward is much to

be felt for.
I hope thy accounts
of thy dear little girl are
favourable & that these
at home are well - my
dear Lucy parents have
many anxious hours.
Believe me -
Thy affte- friend
ECole

for
Lucy
