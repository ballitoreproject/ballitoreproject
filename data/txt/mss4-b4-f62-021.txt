Solomon Watson of Clonmel dined here yesterday, to
whom I communicated the dull news of dear cousin
Thos. Grubb's decease; (I do not think he felt it much.) -
It seems but a few days since I saw him cheerful
& in health apparently, in Youghal, & a gentleman
he was, & a kind friend in his own house: upon
reading thy account, four lines I have seen in one
of the Belfast magazines occur'd, viz:
"When our friends drop off around us,
"Sinking one by one to rest,
"Let not grief or doubt confound us
"Hope will whisper, they are blest."
Altho' it may seem unccountable [underline]for me[/underline] to have any
Altho' it may seem unaccountable [underline]for me[/underline] to have any
Altho' it may seen unaccountable [underline]for me[/underline] underline to have any
business to transact, yet I have certainly a little here,
which would be accommodated better by my staying
a while longer: when we meet I can tell thee about
it, till which I expect to remain very affectionately
Summerville:
29/8 mo: 1809.
Becky Harvey sends thee love.
Your
S: Shackleton.
