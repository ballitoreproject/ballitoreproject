93 First-day 13/10 mo: Was a sweet day (in [word cut off]) to my spirit: I remember we are very [word cut off] to complain of poverty & painful feelings, then why may we not as re^a^dily confess to the feelings of what we suppose good. - I know I thought I was made sensible of this sweet feeling soon after sitting down in meeting this day, & while enjoying it a little, a poor man (who perplexes them here with sort of preaching) stood up & began to say something, which did not distress me equal to two men friends (& who very like did right in so doing) taking him out, partly by force: - if it be possible to bear a little with such intrusions without hurting the meeting I always wish it to be done, - Ah I remembered this day, as often before, the meek & bearing & forbearing example of our gracious Master: - I thought when He was upon earth, would He have done so? - I thought was this poor little man rich & great in this world, would not some other way have been contrived:
