 92 my friends telling me they believed it was not a wrong step. Sixth-morning out again came home pretty late from Wm. Rathbones (where dear M:D had a very open sweet time) visited five families this day. Seventh-day morning M:D very poorly with the colick, was ill in the night, & up taking medicine, so was delayâ€™d rather longer than common in the morning, & got but four families visited this day. the last was one lone woman, whose husband was not as good as he ought to be, & has left her here my faith (if it was faith) was closely tried, for I could not get rid of a [unclear] verse, - nor could I (I thought) express but as I did, which was as follows,
	Good when He gives, supremely Good,
	Nor less when He denies,
	Even crossed from His bounteous hand
	Are blessings in disguise.
Here my true motherly friend M: Dudley did not leave me in dismay, but sweetly expressing it rightly, (ie fit for a meeting) shewed she had unity with it which was a great comfort to me, - & I was not uneasy about it afterwards.
