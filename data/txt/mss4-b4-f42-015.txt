Clonmel 20th of 11th mo 1794
My dear Mother,
It is long since I had the satisfaction to address
a few lines to thee, finding it difficult to get quiet enough
to converse in this manner, & now, I am not situated very
agreeably in this respect, some of the children have been very
poorly, [deletion]with[/deletion] affected by an epidemical disease, feverish &
swellings about their throat, in particular Anne has been quite
ill & her throat much ulcerated, but thro' divine favour is
finely recovered. Robert seems the worst at present, being very
puny & fretful, as if the disorder was not wholly gone off
he has a cough & little appetite, & the weather is not favourable
to take the air we expect in a little time to move to
a more airy situation, having taken Richard Sparrow's
house on the Quay, I dont remember whether thou [insertion]saw[/insertion] that
house, it is pretty convenient, & has a little flower garden
at the back, my Husband says it would be better in a
yard for the children to play in: there may be a pretty border
for flowers, & the middle left open for that purpose I think,
it is situated very conveniently to our field & garden, not
very far from our old house where the Widow Davis lives
& joins our Stores, so that a door may be opened out of
& joins our. Stones, so that a door may be opened out of
them into the [insertion]little[/insertion] garden, which thou may think would be a
considerable convenience to us, especially at night to the
children who are obliged to go back & forward in the dark
evenings. Richard Sparrow has taken the great Mills of
evenings, Richard Sparrow has taken the great Mills of

Martfield. near which he intends to build a house, he
proposed in the mean time to reside in an old Mansion
house of John Bagwells, but whether he will put that
schime in practice or not, I cannot tell, so that we are
scheme in practice or not, I cannot tell, so that we are
not certain when possession will be given us, so cannot
fix any time for giving this house up to another, I was
greatly pleased at our getting this house, & the prospect
of removing there a pleasing one, but all things of this
nature are so uncertain, that a change of events may
frustrate its accomplishment, how soon was blooming Tommy
Fayle cut off, just entering into the enjoyment of [insertion]a[/insertion] fair
outward inheritance, his wife having brought him another
addition to a beloved offspring in a few days sickness
he was removed from all these things, & left a mournful
young Widow, scarcely believing it possible that
she was so bereft, I believe he would have occupied this
house, which we have taken, & perhaps have had the
Mills in town, which are now to set, he was a partner
with Richard in them. I wish much to see thee my
dear Mother, & had a view of going to Dublin meeting
but was prevented. now I flatter myself with going to
but was prevented, now I flatter myself with going to
Carlow, cannot tell what may occur then to hinder, for I
am much tied to home, finding my care greatly wanting
there, tho' the children are generally pretty healthy, Thomas
the most delicate of the flock, we would be very glad
to have thee taking a view of them here, Elizabeth
Pike

Pike gets out, & who knows but thou might be strengthened
to perform one journey more to Clonmel I want thee
to perform one journey more to Clonmel, I want thee
to see all thy Grandchildren, & they want to see thee.
Margt & Samuel greatly desire it, & Sally thinks she [insertion]ought[/insertion]
to be taken to visit thee, Richard often talks of thee
Abram at times, but he is one of few words, Anne expects
to go first opportunity; but to see [insertion]thee[/insertion] here is the most
desirable to us. I heard Molly's youngest child was poorly
I hope she is better, Sally went to the North, & I was glad
to hear so agreeable an account of dear Hannah Davis,
that she has a living child, what a comfort to Sally to be
a witness to such a favour! I hope Molly will write to
for thee, & say how you all are, is dear Richard
Shackleton come home, & how is he?
ckleton come home, & how is he?
I think there is not any great alteration amongst our
I think there is not yet any great alteration amongst our
friends here quite new, they are mostly pretty well, M:
Dudley has been poorly, but is better. Jane Jacob very
lustly, the family there pretty well. Jervais Johnson from
the Northren part of this land has been amongst us acceptably
on a religious visit, William Hogg a hopeful
youth came with him, I went to Garriroan meeting
with them, Mary Jackson was very ill, it looks as if
she was drawing near a final leave of Time, the other
branches of the family seemed in health, except her
sister Hannah, who looks breaking, old age having made
great advances on her.
My Husband & children join in dear love to you all
I remain they affectionate Margt Grubb

I intended to have sent this by Robert Dudley, but as I
hear his going is uncertain I am obliged to have the letter
go by post: I wonder he don't go, my Brother had best write
him I believe if he does not soon.
