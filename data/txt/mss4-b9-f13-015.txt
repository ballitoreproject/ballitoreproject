Richmond 3rd - of 11th mo: 1824
My dearest Sarah,
I could not write sooner to thee
for I was not able to handle the pen, - or I would
to tell thee I was glad to get thy few lines in
my mother's letter to congratulate [insertion]thee[/insertion] on the fruit
of thy painful perseverance. --- I send thee
the yarn at last - some of it is unscoured & I am
ashamed to send it so, but I had not time to get
it done & feared missing the oppy: -- I wish
greatly to see John. but I suppose not more than
thou dest Joseph Lussy Dobbins was here yesterday
spent the day with us I was delighted to
have her, She says she is soon going to Dublin
& will so see thee. She has three lovely sweet
children - I suppose thou heard of her good fortune. -
I had a letter the other day from Fanny Lefans 
as soon as my fingers will permit me to
write decently for I cannot hold the pen long - I intend
replying to her tell her so if thou should see her
Be sure send me letters by Dennis Fisher he
lodges at 3 Trnity street & has thy parcel. I tell
thee here again because James says thou will
not see it under the seal. - I would thank thee
to send the enclosed to Slynes Bridge Street

[deletion][/deletion] Joseph has got shoes & stockings - but he
does not stand alone yet. He is beginning to talk
at least his aunt Sally says so - he can say Mama
& baba & boo - but nothing else. I have put him
in nanbreen frocks. _ Picture a chubby little fellow
with [double underline] rosy [/underline] cheeks & large dark blue eyes in a
little dark sable's skin hat & dark blue julisse
7 thou can see my [underline] Patha beg a thee [/underline] little pet of the
house). I am indeed longing to shew him to thee
& to see Meg & John. - I shall be anxious to
hear how thou proceeds. - Is Mary with thee
still. - I heard Mother & she were to return
soon. _ Will Debs be soon with thee. _ I wrote
to her by today's post. _ _ I was disappointed
not to get the yarn spun sooner & fear it was
inconvenient to thee to be without it so long
My dear love to Edward. _ I really intend
to take a good pen some day , & write a
letter to him. _ I should do it before the busy
season comes as I won't get an answer till
doomsday . _ I must call on James to day

something fer my finger pants to be
freed . _ Ever my dearest Sarah thine
affectionatly
L J Fisher
And he my dear Sal obeys the call [underline] con amore [/underline] --
I am truly happy to hear of you & your children's welfare __
how that termination [underline] ren [/underline] adds to your matronly
respectability - We have heard but little of John & imagination
or fancy can do but little to image a dear
friends child - more particular son & heir - We had
[unclear]Lipy[/unclear] Dobbin here yesterday as Lyd tells you - She is a pleasant
little creature & has three fine children - I could not
help telling you also for her visit to
us was a very agreeable one __ I am
very little in the habit of writing letters
at all now or I dont know but I should have attempted
to renew my correspondence with Edward __ such near
communications should not be satisfied with holding their only
communications at such long intervals as our visits to
each other allow for __ but I believe it is I am somewhat
indolent and indeed when I am at home Lyd has constant
calls upon me to amuse Joze & top him about than
which he likes nothing better _ Lyd has made no hunde
the pen for her indeed once she took to handling phosphong.
I suppose you will soon see Capt Medwyn's Conversations

with Byron, and I suppose we shall not until the quarto
addition has satisfied the avidity of the Immortal Poet's
[underline]rich[/underline] admirers, and an humbler volume is issued from the
press to feed the voracity of the more humble craven after
such [underline] heliconian [/underline] [deletion] drafts [/deletion] draughts _ We had a letter from Thos.
lately but his number of pupils had not increased. We
had tremendous doings here the other day employing the
proxy of Lord Wellisby in the person of Lord Clare to do a
bit of a job that I have no doubt would have been better
done & I am sure without half the noise, by a common
mason's apprentice [deletion]ship[/deletion]. Do you often see Dick Webb _ my
correspondence with him seems to have ceased almost altogether _
I should like to hear if he be quite uncovered
With dear love to Edward I am my dearest Sarah most
affectionately yours J J Fisher
Jennie Fisher brings there to thee _ he lodges at
3 Trinity street & please to [unclear][/unclear] there for the
parcel.
