St. Andrews day -
30th Novr 1789 The 44th Commemoration of the happy
union of an Ancient Couple who were married
in 1745 when the Rebels were at Derby.
When Rebels roused the hostile hand
And Spread confusion thro' this land
[underline]One female[/underline] found among the fair
Protesting Providence's care
That best of Gifts reserved for me,
Whom virtue, Truth & sense have joined,
To form a perfect female mind,
And time the beauties constant spoiler,
Arms his Shafts in vain to foil her -
Two last lines of another for the yr. 1788
in spite of age in Spite of time,
She's still my lovely valentine. -
Carlow 5th. mo: 16th 1790
