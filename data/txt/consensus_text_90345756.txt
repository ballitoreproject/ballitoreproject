severe pain in his back - and hardly
able to walk without pain - We are
daily expecting to hear news of Polly.
13 Thursday - Went down to Bray -
all ready to go to town in case I got
a letter from Margt. with [underline]directions[/underline], [deletion]but[/deletion]
I did get a letter but with very different
news, announcing the birth of a
fine little boy - and saying that
both Polly and [insertion]her[/insertion] baby were getting on
well - the child is to be called
Edward Barrington White a fine name.
I am so glad it is over and that all
went on well - Papa not being
any better sent for Doctor Darby who
says it is [underline]only[/underline] lumbago - which ails
him - bad enough I think - Cha came
out to tea but went in again
14 We had a visiter here to breakfast
J Perry Jr - I rode down to Bray
to get the letters soon - but alas no
letter from Orange Hill - had an escort
most of the way -
John came out to tea -
May
Grandmama Aunt Eliza
and Emily drove over
and staid to dinner and
tea -
