Richmond 8th of 7th month 1828
My dearest Sarah
So thou hast been rambling
through the Country of the Poppy War & I am fearful
that that excursion will prevent thy seeking the
scene where the famous treaty of Limerick was signed
Ah!. do not let it. I have my mind bent on having
thee this summer & Edward encourages the hope
On the other side I send the requisite to pay John
my candle bill - I have been thinking that it would
be impossible for me to get the dinner service before
the meeting which is only one week from next first
day. So I must rub on as well as I can & strive to
match in time articles which I have not - the rest
We had quite made up our
minds to have got the brown
ware[underline]Italian flower garden"[/underline] but
knowing thy absence from town I delayed
writing & it is too late now. I also want some dozen
dinner glasses & ale glasses but I hear they are a great
deal dearer so as I am offered a loan for the time of
the meeting[insertion]I must be content[/insertion]. Indeed after my return from Dublin I
was so dull about hearing this, that I could not think
of any thing else almost - If we were once past the meeting
I might so without [deletion]it[/deletion] [insertion]them[/insertion] for perhaps two years. for this
makes me at present more careless than I otherwise should
be - however if thou hast bought them I will send thee
another bill on La Touche for the amount with many
thanks. James is much obliged to Edward for sending
the leases. We have got Sally home greatly to my father's
& James' ease of mind. I cannot say that I feared
her not being home in time & I had good help at
home from 4 servant women so that I have nothing
to do I may say Tell Grace Thomas that an opening
the moreen I toured is full of little Hack spots, which
spoils the look of it. Considerably, when opportunity
offers I mean to send thee a bit to show
her. Charlotte Dawson tells me that John was
very ill & that Eliza went to Bristol - how is
all this? I hope John is recovered. As Lucy was
with thee in Enniscorthy I hope Selina will accompany
thee here how are the children Have you at home
Willie - Mine are well except that Jose has got a
sore face from cold & the heat of the sun being out
constantly during the hay maturing & bees swarming time
Charlotte would be much obliged by thy telling some of
the Allens that she arrived safely to us & that she
gave us a most pleasant surprise. Wert thou
not astonished at Sarah Godlee I was but recf
at John Rickman It is a queer world I have
no more to say & write in great haste - I am obliged
for the gown & scarf which look very well I think
James is fine & free now & has great enjoyment in
in the country, rescued to us. I saw it is all over & we
mean to preserve the knowledge to ourselves for
the future. What say you to O'Connell - he made
a great stir in the town yesterday & is panting
away merrily. I wish I had one of his paintings
now. Love to Edward Fare Well saith thy affec
