It feels pleasanter to me, & more like doing as I
would be done by to mention a circumstance to thee wch.
happened last first-day morning. The young-woman I
have to asist me in taking care of my mother & I,
take our turns in going out, I generally prefer week-day
& afternoon-meetings to 1st morning, – so, as usual,
I was giving my mother her breakfast, – Mary just going
out of the door to meeting, when upon raising my
mother up to take her to the other room. I heard her
make a strange noise in her throat seemingly, & sink
from me to the ground, I shriek'd for Mary, she heard
me & run up instantly,- [underline]we[/underline] were not able to lift
her up, I apprehended it was the bit of bread & butter
she was eating stuck in her throat, & that she
was [underline]without the least doubt choaking,[/underline] Oh how
was [underline]without the least doubt choaking,[/underline] - Oh how
dreadful were my feelings, that she should, after
all my watching & anxious care, come to an untimely
end, & [underline]I[/underline] the means too, by perhaps moving
her in the act of swallowing:– but to my, I hope
I may say, thankful astonishment , she, after some time.

time breath'd, – but it was a struggle past description:– I
know not W:L was returned from Munster till I saw
him in the room, he & Mary Doyle were able to lift my
poor mother up on the side of the bed,– in a few minutes
I saw around us, W:& M:L, A:&L:S, M:& A: Doyle,
& G:Lee, beside comers & goers– when she got
recovered the suffocating we got her into bed, where
she lay all day in a very restless state: –2d day, we
took her up & dress'd her, & she walk'd, with difficulty,
to the other room, where she dos'd in the easy-chair
till afternoon, when she reviv'd wonderfully, & continues
quite finely ever since.– It is now supposed,
without do[insertion]u[/insertion]bt, by most, that it was a pretty sever
paralytick-fit:– she now walks about finely, & takes
a good deal of supping food. I thought those particulars
were due from [underline]me[/underline] to [underline]thee[/underline], my dear sister,
relative to whom I know thou loves, & who
dearly loved thee. Dear sister Molly, what with
the fright, & her fatigue, attending to two of the
children i the chin-cough, seem'd almost overpowered
on 2d day, but look'd cheery yesterday & to day.

I have, since this shock, received thy letter, & wish
when inclination occurs thou would not be anxious for
a free conveyance for thy letters, I would not grudge
postage to hear from thee. As to Jane Haughton's marriage,
thy letters came late to prevent Betsy's attendance,
some conversation pass'd before she went upon the subject,
Jane seem'd earnest to have her, & she to be with
her:– some hoped I believe, (of which number I am) that
the practice of disowning for attending the present marriages
would not be persisted in, –if so I suppose
it will deprive our society of many of its
worthy members:– It would trouble me, to cause
my friends [underline]trouble[/underline], & I think this would be the [underline]only[/underline]
objection I would have to be a witness:– I hear Corry
& Jane conducted themselves very agreeably, & that
it was a time of solemnity, that they spoke, after
a pause; & an agreeable certificate was read, & signed
by a few. It seems to me vastly preferable to employing
a priest, & rushing into the state in a giddy
manner, which I apprehend has not been their case: there
are numbers of [underline]members[/underline], very inferior indeed to [underline]Corry[/underline].
My heart entirely accords with those words in thy last, "Whereas
"our safety & comfort lie in being content to know nothing but
"as

"as the heavenly father is pleased to reveal hidden things to his
"babes, to whom he holds forth, in his own time the breasts of his
"consolations". I am not sensible of [deletion]those[/deletion] the feelings of desiring to
unravel mysteries, or craving ungranted knowledge, I think [underline]that[/underline] wch
my soul covets is, "Wisdom to worship God aright,
"To know [underline]his[/underline] holy will
"To do my duty in his sight
"And [underline]his[/underline] commands fulfill.
[unclear]covered by stamp[/unclear] as much of this resigned, quiet, peaceful feeling as I
remember ever to feel, I have of late passed several solitary
months, wishing to be preserved steady & "firm" to
whatever I believe required from [underline]within[/underline], & if I am judged
unfavourably of, why, if I do my best, I hope to be enabled
to bear whatever may come rightly. As to erring, I think
all men (of my acquaintance) are given to err, & I believe there
is but one unerring [underline]guide[/underline]. My very dear sister farewell.
