indeed I'am afraid the Doctor is
rather a prejudiced man from several
other remarks he made.
x 20th. Second day - Had another reading
and working morning - till past 12
when the Doctor had to leave us, as
he was going by the train to Besbrook,
In the evening we went to James Bells
where we met most of the last
evenings company and spent a
pleasant evening -
x 29th.. This evening at the Haughtons, company
ditto. A Mr and Mrs Malcomson
from America are staying at James Bells
John Malcomson was formerly a friend
and went out when very young to America
where he married. I believe this is his
second wife, she is rather young and
very lively, from [insertion]one of[/insertion] the Southern States
I think. No letter from home.
x 30th.. Nothing at all particular to day
which I spent very idly indeed
31st.. William Chandler breakfasted here.
