Ballitore 1st of 2nd.. month 1704
Dear Thomas
I wrote to my Uncle as thou desired me & I hope to be
bound next 5 month for I am tired of Ballitore & when I'm bound I
hope it will be in Dublin. I requested of my Uncle to procure me
the pleasure of seeing my mother but if I do be bound next 5 month
which I hope I will I have no occasion to go to see her untill I be
bound which she told me [insertion]in[/insertion] one of [insertion]her[/insertion] letters it was not in her power to send
for me but when I would be bound we would see one another
for peace or rest in my mind I will not have untill I see her for
my heart burneth within me when I think of her. I have learned
high enough in Arithmetick to be bound & if thee be particular about
the rule that I last learned [insertion]it[/insertion] is Fellowship with Time
and in Book-Keeping Im, in the Journal.
I would be obliged to thee if thee would send me word when
I will be bound & to what I Trade & what place.
I am thy Affectionate & loving friend
Aaron Atkinsone
