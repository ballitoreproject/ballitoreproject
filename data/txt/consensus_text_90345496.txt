to leave so we have to disappoint
the Shackletons again - Erasmus
went with an apology and as
he did not return tonight I suppose
was prevailed upon to stay.
31 Thursday - Another broiling
sunny day - The Doctor called
again - and finds [insertion]one of[/insertion] his patients
much better, but as for poor
Ned he still looks most wretchedly.
He was recommended to take a
row out on the sea so Philip accompanied
him down after dinner
bringing Alexander with them
so they had quite pleasant row.
Erasmus met [deletion]them[/deletion] and came
up with them and tells us how
he staid the night; saw the
regatta at Dalkey this morning
and had ever so much fun
and amusement-.
Aunt Elizabeth called to see
the invalids - but did not
stay long -.
Alexander
Barrington
came out
to stay a
few days
and Grandmama
and
Aunt Lucy
drove over
to dinner
