Anner Mills 20th 5th month 1820
Thy kindness my much loved friend made my heart to overflow
so that I could many times since have [unclear]saluted[/unclear] thee as to feeling
but not conveniently as to leisure for pen.
Our Elizabeth returned in better state than I could have
expected which I very much impute under the protection
of Providence to the cheering effects of the society of her
friends, all combining to do her good - she found her flock
in favoured health, and the old Mother enlivened by her
safe return accompanied by her honest husband who
notwithstanding his anxiety, exhibited improvement
by his excursion - There was not another place so likely
to revisit Elizabeth as within your precints; the
harmony & vivacity of the scene in addition to your unceasing
affection & withal your skill & tenderness for
invalids qualified in an especial degree to restore -
I am much gratified with the reciprocal opportunity for
cementing friendship, and that my daughter should become
more intimately acquainted with those whom I prized in early
life

I hoped as she bore the [unclear]Journey [/unclear] so [unclear]tobrhy [/unclear] that by dyrus the
painful sensation in a Chaise would be overcome, but as these
efforts this last week she suffered so much as to afflict
me and by ceasing from the attempt she appears better
We have not a horse to be depended on for the Pillius, her
own favourite Physician prescribed that mode of exercise
long since as the most likely to prove beneficial
I am cheered by Elizabeths descriptions of Ballitore
Dear Lydias latter days being so tranquil is truly consoling
to me. I have always felt interested for Richard and
I am comforted that his attention is so bestowed on his Mother
Present my love to each of the family and to thy own
and thy sister Chandler & hers and to our other kind friends
Our amicable niece Deborah has lost her brother Thomas
which must plunge the family into affliction; he died about
6 on the evening of the 18th. Susanna has to contemplate
her Brother Roberts fractured affairs, his door was shut
15th So trouble takes its round and calls for universal
sympathy - the pang of feeling others woe is almost unceasingly
my experience of latter times - though we

indulged with rewarding blessings which I struggle to be
thankful for - I fear thy loving Elizabeth has not been
much with Anna Richardson she would not absent
from Mary - James was returning and is I hope at home
ere now he left Rebecca & Sarah well at Tottenham
he hoped to meet Stephen & William at Worcester
Now my precious Mary Leadbetter very dearly farewell
S.G.
