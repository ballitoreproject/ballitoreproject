not had thine, the Expectation of which has made me
Differ writing till now but am glad to hear of thine and
Cousins wellfare, and by these thou mayst know that I with
the rest of our family are in good health hoping they may
find thee partakers of the same mercy; and Dear Aunt please

with thee which will be great pleasure and satisfaction to me,
My Mother wrote in my [deletion]I[/deletion] last letter where she mention'd the
Decease of our friend Rachel Arnold which if thou recd. not

Smal time after and now our Neighbour Jane Aldam is departed
