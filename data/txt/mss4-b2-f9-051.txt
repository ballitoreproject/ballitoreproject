	Ballitore: 6/2 month 1781.
		I would not willingly have been so long in replying to my dear Cousin Debby's Letter, but engagements of one kind or other came in my way, among the rest a Tour to Dublin about some business was an impediment - Considering the circumstances of affairs with you, I do not wonder at thy being perplexed - I was almost sick, reading thy detail of your situation, though I knew the matrimonial part of the story before - thou need never expect that matrimony-affairs will be kept secret - I had heard of T: Phelp's application before I wrote my last to thee, & found it was ^even^ known in Nicholson's family in Dublin - things of this nature (I have often observed) transpire wonderfully - they are very subtle & slip out at a narrow chink - besides, in a plot of this kind, a Woman is always one of the party - but I will say no more on that head - Seriously, (though I pity you so much, I think it would be no harm to make you a little merry) - but seriously our poor dear Peggy as well as her mother must have had a troublesome time of it. However, when this fermentation shall have subsided, the liquor will be fine & clear, & these dregs of perturbation & perplexity will sink to the bottom - It's an affair that intimately & ultimately concerns the young woman herself most, & there should no undue influence be used even by parental authority, much less by any subordinate, delegated power. Let her take her own time, maintain her own prerogative, keep ^as^ quiet & still in her own mind as possible, & determine at her leisure according to her best sense. Men take what time they please before they venture to offer their dear selves - Why should the Women be precipitated into an Answer? Not that I like unnecessary delay; for I think a man & woman between whom such a thing lies out an awkward sort of figure while it is depending. Indeed the matter is of great import, & & deserves deep inquiry & solid attention: but when a Ray of Divine Light points out the object, & the decision is come to, it's idle for any to presume to prevent the junction - Men in their own spirits may embarrass, & cause uneasiness for a while, but patience & meekness of wisdom being exercised, the impediments will gradually be removed, & things work their quiet way into the natural channel of divine appointment - Peggy has lost no time, & yet young as she is, we are so puzzled & hampered about her, I could wish her well married to some honest friend, out of our way: there would then be some chance for other people's daughters, who can hardly get one Lover apiece. I hope thou wilt soon let me know what turn things take, for I really am uneasy about your situation in divers respects, though an involuntary spark of pleasantry flies out. Thy intelligence, my dear friend, is always agreeable to me: even when I am pained by it, thy friendly, confidential effusions please me - I love & pity you all - but whence can I help you? I look on myself as much your Inferiour in best knowledge & capacity - but my good desires are for you, when it's in the power of my heart to offer them - I suppose ye had Robert Dudley & Robert Grubb at your province meeting - I would like to know how things went on there - whether there be more of Concord & Unanimity among the Princes, &c., &c - Poor Joseph Tomey was the only Ministering friend at our Province ^Quarterly^-meeting at Carlow (20th & 21 st ultimate) It may be said I think respecting him that "Joseph is yet alive" - he was (in my estimation) much favoured. Our next Province-meeting is to be at Mountrath in due course - The next Province-meeting is to be (for Munster) two weeks hence at Clonmel - I have some thoughts of attending it, & taking the opportunity of paying a visit to my children & grandchildren there - I would be pleased to hear from thee before I leave home - I hear that Chrissy, Phebe, & their trusty attendant John Conran have got to Dublin, but but their future destination, & whether John has left them are unknown to me - I would like to know what it was that T: G: said in the opportunity, which gave offence ^concern^ to our English friends - There is danger on both sides - they may have occasion for advice & caution: & he may not administer it in a proper manner - I believe I am not altogether in their good graces - but that's very immaterial - I would rather that they were right, & I wrong in my apprehension concerning their connexion with John Conran - Indeed there is great necessity for the inward man to have the spiritual senses well-exercised; that as the outward mouth tasteth meats, & receives & refuses according to a right taste; so the spiritual ear may try words, & distinctly know what language they are uttered in, whether of Canaan, or Babylon - I had a trial of this sort at our Meeting here 4th - Andrew Delap (who had been a Speaker among the Methodists) appeared among us as a Minister - I hope ever to be cautious of judging on such solemn subjects even in thought. But I expect Time & further experience will manifest to others & perhaps to himself more fully - At present it seems best to follow the Apostle's advice, "Lay hands suddenly on no man" - Andrew has parted with his uncle (who lived at or near Castlecomer) & thought to live with Robert Dudley as land-steward: but Sam Haughton being desirous of having him to assist him while his wife continues in her present weak situation, I know not but he will settle with the latter for a while - it seems uncertain - Andrew is but a weakly man - Sally Haughton is in a very poor way, & yet the symptoms of her disorder do not seem to increase - so that she is not given up quite - Joseph Tomey was remarkably led in the publick Quarterly Meeting to supplicate on behalf of such a state as her's - I spent a little time with her 2d instant having accompanied hence to Carlow Robert Watson's wife & sister Sally, who were so kind as to come on purpose from Killconner to pay us a visit of a few days. Old Surgeon Pope of Carlow is dead - We have dull accounts of the state of old James Malone, & old Samuel Elly - John Conran about 3 years ago sent us a Gardener from the North (Owen Campbell) he gave us a great deal of satisfaction by his honesty, industry & ingenuity - he lived in a little house of Aby's in this village - his wife gave suck to Aby's daughter in his own (Aby's) house - Sickness came, or rather was brought (it is said) into the poor man's family - his eldest a fine boy took ill but recovered - his next (a fine girl) died in the bed (I am told) by her fathers side - The father himself fell sick & died 28th ultimate, to all our great concern - Aby had a physician to attend him - he is now likely to have the poor man's son & infant daughter a charge to ^on^ him, which he cheerfully undertakes - Our little Peggy does not appear to suffer much from her nurse's trouble - Poor, giddy Ruth Nicholson! She was not likely to keep - I pity my dear friend her Grandfather - Tis one other stroke of the hammer of affliction before he goes off the Stage - Surely he is like beaten gold - If thou hast opportunity, please present him with mine & wife's very dear salutation - I have been favoured with Letters last week from several of my English Correspondents - John Pim's family much as usual - Morris Birkbeck has been very ill, but thought to be recovering - M Ridgway & Jane Watson in London pretty well in health, & good accounts of their service - Betty Gregory also writes that she gets better health - I hear Jo Sparrow has sailed from Waterford, in order to sue for Molly Davis - I commend him much for his choice, hearing a very good character of her, though not personally acquainted with her - I wish poor Jemmy Lecky, after all his trials, may make such a wise choice - I saw the Widow Stewart & her son William, when I was last in Dublin just the old way - she very poorly, & he very tender of her - her son George in the College, declines going into orders, & seems addicted to a modish life - her daughter Bell married to a Surgeon Hartigan, a young man of good character, but inferiour I suppose in point of fortune - the mother assented to it. Our families are favoured with tolerable health - My wife at times complaining, but gets about - My Grandson & Namesake a very fine fellow. We all join in dear love to thee, & Peggy, all the James's, R & W Pike, & Aby Atkinson (his little nephew is come to school here.)
	With cordial desires for the welfare of thee & thine, that best Wisdom may guide you, & best strength support you, I remain very affectionately thine
