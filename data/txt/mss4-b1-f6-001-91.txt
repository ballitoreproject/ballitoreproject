Seend, near Devizes, Wilts. 15th Nov 1790.
My Dear Sir,
Yesterday I rec'd your favor of the 30th ult
you do me justice in believing that an account of the
welfare of yourself & family would be gratifying to
me in whatever situation I am or may be - it is with great
pleasure I learn that you were all so lately well, and
I sincerely wish you all a continuance of that blessing
I have had tolerable good health lately the gout not
having paid me his respects these three months - Mrs. Eyre
has been [underline]very ill[/underline], but thank god is now in a fair way
of recovering health - I beg my most hearty & sincere
congratulations on the happy event about to take place
in your family, & that every possible comfort & happyness

constant attendant, is my most hearty prayer.
As to the bond you hold from my brother with all
its &c. &c. I am quite at a loss to know how to answer you
it is a very great pity you shou'd be so long kept out of
money which you have so deservedly earn'd, and which
in justice & honor shou'd have been long since paid
you, it is quite out of my power to discharge such
a debt for my brother, & to tell you the truth his
