My dear Lydia,
Am sending
buttons - I think
it would not do
to send by parcel
post - the boxes
as soon as I can
& ask him what
he will charge. &
I will take the
odds & ends &
send them separately
in a box. or today
if I can - with
buttons = The name
of our Laundry
is The Dublin steam
Laundry Compy Limited
Co Dublin
Milltown

would have to be
carefully packed
as the wood is old
& I have watched
them throwing the
parcels about in
the offices -
 I wont be able
to do any thing
about them until
the end of next
week - as I am
expecting Mrs Cope
tomorrow, & I
am [underline]not well[/underline]!!!
so cannot go
out = & sending
messengers all
unsatisfactory -
I will go to Hick

again with
much love -
Believe me
Yours affetly
Lydia
The key is belonging
to tea-caddy -
P.S. I have heaps of
things to tell but had not
time
