Dublin 6-11 month 52

My dear Wife,

	This with dear Love to thee, father, mothers & Sister & enquiring friends may let thee know we got well to the City, & I have lodged these two nights with Cousin James Pim at Peter Judds. I desire a few lines from thee directed to Isaac Jacksons informing me how ye all are, particularly thyself.
	My Dear, desiring thou wilt keep this to thyself, & in hope that thou wilt fulfill this to my desire, I open my heart to thee at this time, & let thee know that I trust it is the Lord, the God of our fathers & forefathers, [2 words crossed out] even the Lord who I believe was with us in joining us according to his holy Ordinance, he has appeared in my heart at this season both in publick & private, as a Refiner with fire, & as a Fuller with Soap, to the cleansing & purifying my heart, & fitting it for a Temple meet for him to dwell in. May thou & I, my dear Wife, patiently abide the day & way of his Coming, that in due Season we may be know & witness our sins blotted out, & the times of Refreshment from before his Presence, that so having desired & permitted him to be the stay of our Youth, we may experience him (if length of days be continued to us) to be the Staff of our Age.The Pennsylvania & English friends here. Tommy Greer James Christy & William Neville from the N. already, Thomas Christy & more expected thence. The Boy is waiting, & I have made an appointment for this hour, so in true love remain
	thy tender affectionate husband
