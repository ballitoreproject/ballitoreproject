Ballitore: 2d. of 9th month 1808.
Dear Friend,
I received thine by my Brother, & as a free conveyance offers I thought
I would tell that I was much obliged by thy remembrance, though concerned
to find thy health & spirits not so good as [deletion][/deletion] when thou wrote last
but I hope these clouds may have passed away, & a brighter sunshine have
illumined thy path. We have our ups & downs our lights & shades, but we
know that through all we have one unfailing friend whose arm is underneath
to support in the deepest trials, if we seek for that support.
I shall feel for you all, & for thee in particular, if you lose J & N: Davis
they are kind sensible friends, & have had their trials, an unsettled situation
in the evening of life is uncomfortable - but perhaps all is for the best. Our
nieces are likely to make a little stay amongst you, perhaps thou will see
more of them. I expect they will be delighted with their visit, & recall pleasing
as well as painful reflections, by the descriptions they will give me of scenes
once familiar, when they return. Their father was much pleased with his
excursion. I am quite concerned that thy name was not amongst the
subscribers. I do not find it in the list returned to me by Jonathan Pike, but
I intend to write it amongst them when [insertion]ever[/insertion] I meet with the Book, as I have done
with several friends whose names have been omitted.

I hope, dear friend, thou art somewhat mistaken in supposing thyself less
dear to thy friends - circumstances may prevent these friends from being so
well able to evince it as formerly, but I do not mean to flatter when I say thou
art one from whom a friend I think could not be alienated. Those of tender
affectionate dispositions are prone to let in a little jealousy of their friends which
it will lend to our peace to guard against - but this does not lessen love to our
friends. - O this golden band of Love! I think there is nothing so desirable as
the preservation of it. - If a link in the precious chain is displaced - it feels like
a broken limb, our movements are impeded till it is restored. Often I wish for the
continuance of it - without it our enjoyments lose their seasoning - with it, welcome
the poor hut[/unclear] & dry potatoe! If we feel it in ourselves, we have a treasure the
world cannot take away, & tho' the want of it in others may grieve & wound us,
we shall be enabled to possess our souls in patience, till the day break & the
shadows flee away.
Our School here gets on well. James & Lydia White are well qualified to
superintend it. I mourned for the suspension of it, & am almost ready to fancy
myself young again, when I see the same scenes passing again before my
view, but my youth has passed away with them, while the seriousness &
respectability attending advanced life I fear is still at a distance from mine.
I blame myself much for trifling, & letting one year pass over another without
a proper consideration of the importance of their flight

John Murray, his wife, & one of her nieces are now on a visit in Ballitore
the two former at John Thomas's, the latter with Mary & Anne Doyle, who have
past of our house. John remembers thee affectionately, & they purpose paying
thee a visit I believe. They are now childless, & I suppose the mother's feeling heart
will never be healed of the wound caused by the untimely death of [unclear][/unclear]
little boy; though she is often cheerful & pleasant. Farewell, dear friend,
I am disappointed of a free conveyance
affctly thine
Mary Leadbeater.
