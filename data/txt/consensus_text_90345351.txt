Jacob Green and two of his nephews
William & James - in the gallery
as several others whose names I do
not now recollect. We all dined
at George Phelp's except R Pike who
was invited some place else. We there
met John and George Pim from Belfast
the latter with his wife and four
of his children, three rosy cheeked
girls and one nice little boy. This
little fellow has been lately bitten by
a dog that ran into the shop - and
away again, and has not I believe been
seen since. His parents are still rather
anxious about him, as they had quite
lately heard of a little boy who had
been bitten in a similar manner
and died [insertion]about[/insertion] six weeks after of hydrophobia
They took all due precautions about
the wound for he was immediately
taken to a doctor; still they cannot
help being uneasy about the poor little
fellow. Well we also met here
