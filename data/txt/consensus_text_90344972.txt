After breakfast the three
of us set to walk, Florence
helping us - like a good
girl as she is -. -
twelve O'clock - and clearing
up. sun shining - busy
still settling [unclear]florens[/unclear] - supper
table getting into shape -
expect 35 - and hope there
will be room - One O'clock,
Ran up stairs to do our hair
and have that job over -
After dinner - busy again,
I forgot to say that Philip
went to town this morning.
as his hair was rather
too long for fashion -.
[extra line]
too long for fashion -.
Well! at seven O'clock
the company begin to
arrive -
