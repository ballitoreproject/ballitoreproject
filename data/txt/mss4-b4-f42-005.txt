My dear Mother,
instant, & intended to have sent it directly to Athy
to avoid any delay, as Debby wrote me she did not even
hear [deletion]the[/deletion] [insertion]my last[/insertion] Child's sex, & I wa dissatisfied my Husband
did not write to her on its birth, as her strong
affection often is productive of uneasiness & jealousy to
her mind, when she conceives [deletion]that[/deletion] [insertion]there[/insertion] is want of attention
to her: but my Husband sent my letter to Ballitore to
be forwarded from thence, in order to convince my
friends there of my recovery, which perhaps was very well,
as it also made me easy at not writing to you sooner.
I was indeed very ill while it lasted, & much alarmed, not
knowing but it was a Messenger to take me out of this
World, & I felt a strong draft if it pleased Infinite Goodness
to remain a while longer in it, not only on account
of the near & dear connections I have here, but also
Clonmel 8th of 9th mo: 1783
I wrote to my sister Chandlee the 4th
that

I might have an opportunity to approve myself more deserving
of Eternal happiness, by fighting more steadily
& more zealously that Good fight which the Apostle witnessed
[underline]he had[/underline] fought, & for which he was to obtain a
Crown of Righteousness, thus my mind laboured under a
sore conflict. I had a good time as to the delivery, I
had a good deal of pain from about 12 to 4, but was
enabled to bear it in quietness & a degree of patience.
my Aunt Sparrow, nor no other friend was with me,
for I thought I should be longer ill, & was unwilling
to disturb her House. I got my Mother to bed by
making her think I was not bad but going to Rest,
(as I really was sleepy between the pains) & I knew she
was not able to be up at night, & I had all things
prepared before, therefore Nurse Bleach, sister Becky &
the Doctor seemed quite sufficient, with having my inward
eye turned to Him who is invisible, & a present help
in the Needful time; the fifth day following I found
my Head much affected, I went to bed early, & the
next

day my Head continued to be attacked, but just about
the time to settle to rest I was seized with violent
pain in my stomach I believe the colick, & vomiting
I thought if it lasted long Nature must yield, the good
natured, skillful Doctor seemed greatly alarmed, as he feared
to give me hot things to ease [insertion]the[/insertion] pain, for fear of an inward
inflamation taking place, next day I had the
pain as violent as before I think, my Aunt Sparrow
proposed a flannel bag [insertion]applied to my stomach[/insertion] of hot bitter herbs, which I
think was of great use [insertion]to[/insertion] me, & also injections which
the Doctor ordered, he lay in the House two nights, &
did all in his power (I believe for me.) I saw myself
surrounded with [insertion]the[/insertion] kindest affectionate friends, Aunt
Sparrow, sister Hannah & all my sisters, with looks of
anxious concern, all exerting their utmost skill & demonstrating
the sincerest friendship for my relief, neither is
Aunt Susy's kindness to be forgotten by me, sister Becky
up part of two nights, rubbing my clammy cold feet
on her knees, which I thought afforded me relief, she desires
to be remembered to you: a first day I found
myself

myself (tho' quite relieved from the pain) exceedingly low &
weak, & as if I could scarcely support under the lowness
I had a moisture all over me which my Aunt Sparrow
wished me to incourage, but the Doctor ordered me
to dry myself up all I could, & [insertion]not to[/insertion] suffer those profuse
sweats to come on me, which at last I tryed, &
found myself much relieved, & that the sweats were more
than I could well bear, Edward Hatton & Mary Moor
were at meeting that day, I wished to see Edward
tho' I feared it would exhaust me too much, in the evening
Sam told me Edward was in the House, so I desired
him to [insertion]be[/insertion] asked up, he came in pleasantly, & his conversation
seemed relieving, but after a little of that he retired into stillness
& he had a sweet, reviving testimony, giving me incouragement
to believe that Gracious Providence would see
meet to raise me up again to my near connections, &
that he had pity on me in my sore conflict of mind, &
what could we render to him for all his benefits? but to
dedicate our Hearts, & all our faculties to his service,
remembering that if any prefered Houses or Lands, Wife (or
Husband) or Children, or any thing to him they were not Worthy
