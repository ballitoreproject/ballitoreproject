My dear Mrs. Leadbeater
I received [insertion]the letter[/insertion] that you and Mrs. Shackleton
were so kind to write to me, and fear that you
and she may take it ill that I have not sooner replied
to it. I assure you that my silence has not
proceeded from any feeling of indifference to the
highly laudable object you are endeavouring
to advance, the employment of the female poor
of your neighbourhood. But I hoped to be in
Ballitore shortly after the rect. of your letter
and have been unexpectedly delayed in
[unclear]Town[/unclear] partly by a soreness of my eyes, from which
tho' better I have not quite recovered. I regret
that heavy losses to which I have been exposed
prevent my subscribing as much as I could
wish, but I will most cheerfully subscribe
a guinea a year for the present.
And am my dear Mrs Leadbeater
with best regards to your good man & family
in which all here join
Most truly yours
Anty [unclear]Mills[/unclear]
