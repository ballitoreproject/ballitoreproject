					Dublin 8th of Fifthmonth, 1770.

		Dear Child,
			I have thy agreeable letter: thy grandfather also received thine. ** We are in usual health. The concluding meetings are to be to-morrow. It has been with me as is usual in my attendance here. The several dispensations which we are under in our religious pilgrimage may be compared (I think) to the various turns, roads, and lanes in a journey. I am at present, and have been for many years, in one long lane: when I shall get out of it I know not. The believer is not to make haste. The great point is to make straight steps, and keep steadily right on our way in the right road, without loitering, looking unnecessarily behind, or, in the impatience of our own spirits, pressing too hastily forward. Indeed, I find the road of this life so bestrewed with difficulties and dangers, and myself so exceedingly weak, and unable, by my own powers, to preserve alive my own soul, or even to succeed in my temporal trans-actions, by reason of my peculiar incapacity, that, under this sense, I cannot but commit me and mine with great earnestness to the protection and help of Divine Providence.
	I have been several times a little in company with thy sweet friend, as thou callest here, (Elizabeth P.) I have found my spirit renewedly and nearly united to her and her sister since I came to town. There are too few here of their stamp. Too many are taken up with foolish, trifling gewgaws, quite unworthy of the noble, rational mind, formed by its great Author for far higher contemplations and enjoyments. For want of spiritual exercise they have lost their spiritual health; they have no appetite for sound, wholesome food; their vitiated taste must be gratified with something that gives a little momentary pleasure, but fills the body with distempers.
				Thy affectionate father,
							R. S.
