Ballitore: 26/8 month 1783
My dear Cousin,
	I wrote to Molly last post -- hope my letter has got to hand -- to that I refer. The present is to request thou wilt seal & forward the inclosed letter to James Morton -- I had a letter lately from Peggy Grubb -- she writes herself better in health & spirits -- she expects to be down (i.e. lying in) in 2 or 3 weeks. --- I also wanted to tell thee that I spoke to Chrissy Hustler about thy spectacles & proposed to pay her, but she said she had got some linen from some of you, & there was an account to settle, so declined receiving my money -- I dont like these nugatory commissions -- they are like the definitive Treaty of Peace - One can see no end of them -- I forgot to tell Molly in my last that there have been (as Fame reports) divers battles lately between Bob Armstrong & Motley, & a reciprocity of black eyes. Bob was displeased with Motley skulking after his daughter -- they are an illiberal couple -- his daughter Sally is married (with consent) to young Richardson -- they live at Cottage -- her father had blows lately (I suppose) with old Richardson uncle of his Son-in-law. All our dear love attends you all -- will expect to hear from thee when convenient. I cannot conveniently enlarge at present. Thine affectionately
Richard Shackleton
P.S. when thou favours me with a line, mayest thou address thy letter [2 words crossed out] to George Dunbar Esquire Member Parliament Ballitore

& put RS on the back.

Tell Molly several new scholars have come of late to her brothers
