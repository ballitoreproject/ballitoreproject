I agree with you, my dear friend, that
part of my book is too deep & mysterious for
my understanding , - I do not repine that it
is so, because He who has revealed himself
in part, has thought fit to exercise my
faith in that which he conceals. I should
Faith in that which he conceals - I should
think myself ungrateful & unjustly suspicious
if I doubted the word of any Human being
who had been uniformly kind to me merely
because I did not quite comprehend how they
were to save me, - & still more reprehensible
were to save me, & still more reprehensible
should I be, could I doubt that [underline] all [/underline] will be fulfilled
which the Almighty has decreed. Enough of
past Prophecy is completed, to satisfy me
 that [underline] all will be so - finally [/underline]_ The practical
part of my ever Honor'd Mrs. B's book, is clear
to us all, & that is the part which most concerns
us to understand - It is a proof of
superior abilities, as well as of a truly Christian
mind to think humbly of the talents we possess
I will therefore say nothing to the opinion which you
Mrs. Leadbeater

profess to entertain of yours, than that in my
estimation - they are well applied, & will receive
a richer reward hereafter, than the trifling
admiration of yours very affectionately
