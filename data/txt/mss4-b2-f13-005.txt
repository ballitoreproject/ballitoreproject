Dear Cousin / I received these per last post, I had writ to thee a week before but was prevented sending it, as no post had come in of a week before the Day I received thine, the roads being entirely blockd up by a greater quantity of snow than was ever known to have fallen in the memory of the oldest person now living, it fell gently & without any Tempest, & we have had no Account of any hereabouts being lost, & it goes away by fine easy gradual Thaws or might have been of bad Consequence to this Country  I likewise received thy other Letter which thou supposd had miscarried  My long silence was partly occasiond by my Brothers situation &c of which I still hoped one time after another I shoud have been capable of giving a better Account; after he had put his Affairs into the hands of his assignees to settle for him, Morris Birkbeck, who is one of em, wrote to thy Father & several other Friends to enquire for a school for him none offering, he took him to settle where by their Interest he had a very good Day school was at first diligent & tolerably weand off Liquor & low & unsuitable Company, but very desirous to have his Wife & 2 Children with him, she being unwilling to go to him unsettled him much, he came to see her frequently & I believe his coming was a hurt to him  One of her Brothers had presented him with a Bill consisting chiefly of sums of Money he pretended to have lent my Brother, or his Wife, to a considerable Amount, my Brother insisted on the whole being an unjust Demand  from very strong Circumstances his Assignees were of the same opinion, & shall continue to think so, but after he begun to come to Skipton amongst his Wifes Friends he was prevaild upon to acknowledge it, as just by which means & his Wife not giving up her Thirds &c., his Creditors will but have about 15 or 16 per pound ^at most^, not withstanding his House, ^his^ Furniture & Land were all sold, & himself left entirely peniless, & yet he might live well if he woud but be sober & industrious, but he seems at present fallen off, his school dwindles, he is still at Settle but in a poor forlorn, discontented situation, he thinks his Friends look coldly on him, indeed he has given us all but too much reason to think meanly of him, as he denied for some Months the Account of his Wifes & Brothers & gave good Reason for it, & afterwards to acknowledge it, is I think by far the worst thing he ever acted, but he is in reality extremely weak, knows little or nothing of Mankind, or the World, has no Resolution of his own, & too often he has been the artful Family he has married into coud by fair Means, almost persuade him to anything  his Wife & 2 little Boys live in a House of her Fathers adjoining to his own, & by whom she pretends is supported, how that is I know not but believe she wants for
My sister Sally continues with Morris Birkbeck, her situation is perfectly agreeable, as she is treated by all the worthy Family with the greatest Regard & affability, she is not with Cousin Morris in the Quality of a servant, but has the care & oversight of his House, & a sweet little Boy his Wife left him, & he being much abroad, Sally rarely leaves her Trust I have not seen her for near a year & half, but expect to have her with me a week or two if I live on a certain Occasion; having an awful Event in prospect hastening upon me, if I live to get well over it & design to write again soon after - It is an affecting Account thou gives one of thy Sisters Death - I hope my poor Cousin is happily releasd from all trouble, & her little son will I doubt not be the object of your Care & Affection, shoud be glad to hear the Child was under your Care, as he woud then have the privilege of a good Example & Education, doubtless if his mother was apprehensive of leaving him she woud ^have^ been anxiously desirous of it  I remember thy father ^when here^ told me he thought his Daughter woud not continue long she having then such poor Health & Spirits - I often thought of her she was an early Correspondent of mine, I think my Father brought one her first letters when he returned from Ireland, we were both then very young - it woud give me great pleasure to be personally acquainted with thee & thy Wife & if it shoud never so happen I beg the continuance of thy correspondence if we live - I have you all in frequent & affectionate remembrance & sincerely wish thee & thy spouse your Health and the Ability to support you under the great Fatigue of your important Business, till such times as you can decline, as with the same pleasing prospect thy Father had of its being carried on by Some of your Children, and if it be the Will of Providence, I coud wish you to enjoy the Fruits of your Labour, in a pleasing retreat from Business, before you grow too old to relish it - My very dear Love attends thy Father Mother & Aunt Barnard self spouse & children & I am Dear Cousin with grateful acknowledgements of your kind regard for me Thy affection kinswoman
