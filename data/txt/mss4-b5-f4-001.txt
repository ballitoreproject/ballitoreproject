Cork 10mo: 10th 1796
Dear Mary,
I received 160 of thy books
of which I sold 44 which amount to Â£2 .. 7s .. 8d. I
paid 3s. 91/2p for the carriage & 4s Custom: I sent thee by
Elizabeth Pike in the 4th mo: 1795 two Guineas, so
that the acct. nearly balances; I endeavoured to sell as
many as I could, I even informed friends when at the
Men's Meeting: I have had some thoughts of keeping
them for my own acct. but I have already upwards of
200 Narrative pieces for young readers, which are
very well calculated for their capacities. however I
intend to endeavour to find out othirs who may be
prevailed upon to purchase some of them, perhaps if
an advertisment was put in the News-paper it
might draw the Attention of others who are not of
our Society who may be inclined to buy some of them
if thou woulds't approve of an Advertisement please
to let me know by a line by some friend who may
go to Half-year's Meeting: thou mayest rely upon it
nothing shall be wanting on my part to dispose of
them, I expected to have sold them all long before this
time but friends here sometimes are not forward in
procuring books which they do not immediately want.
I remain with love to Wm., thy Mother's & Abram's family
thy assured friend,
Thos. Knight Albey.
