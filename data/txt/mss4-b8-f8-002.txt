Sept 7 - 23.
Dear Elizabeth
I send herewith the Poem
you lent me, and thank you
for it, I hope I did not keep it too long.
I did not meet with the 2nd vol of
Modern Philosophers yet. Am I right
in saying the 2nd Vol for I lost your
note. I hope soon to have it for you.
I send a parcel for E Gough which you
would oblige me, to send to her the
first opportunity, there is no hurry
so dont inconvenience yourself. Do you
hear often from Lydia now, the last
time I heard was from Eliza who had

a letter. Little Magt. is very well
she is in the Glen and looks right well
you would scarcely know her she has
grown so much and smiles and
laughs as usual I hoised her the
other night, that is, Wednesday night
the last time I saw her. I've heard from
Sarah & Edward yesterday, they are
at present at the Lakes I suppose.
and have fine weather as yet.
Remember me to Richard and hoping
you are all well I remain
yours John Barrington Junr
