	It is very kind & quite right of thee, my dear cousin, to give us frequent information of the state of thy own & familys health. We are I believe deeply interested at heart in one anothers welfare; & I trust our little flock & families are under the notice of Him who is best able to help us  Trials & afflictions take their round, & will, sooner or later, come to us in course  but to be in favour with the Almighty, to keep the vessel of conscience clean should be the great business & our lives  then there is a place of refuge provided, a munition of rocks. I hardly credited the account in the newspaper of the two friends being executed ^[in America]^: but by a letter from England I fear it is too true  by this letter it seems ^looks^ as if they had made themselves too busy in serving a party, & that they did not suffer on account of their religious principles, but on the principle of the cruel policy of horrid war. +++ There may be & doubtless are false reports purposely or accidentally propagated  but I think it needs must be that our friends there are deeply tried, even to the very foundation of their faith. May we who enjoy a present temporary tranquility, a momentary calm, the sunshine of an hour  may we make good use of this quiet season, be diligent in spirit, wrestling for the blessing of preservation, & the support of the divine arm under the pressure of the calamities which may yet be before us, perhaps nearer than some are aware of. +++
	The division of my family, & the establishment of my son & his help-mate in their important charge & office have come very near me, & frequent & strong have been my petitions that the Lord of Heaven & Earth might bless & prosper us in that way which we are about to do, not rashly nor out of his fear, but I trust in his counsel, & under his approbation. We heard here what thou mentions about thy Peggy ^M^ - poor child! - it is time enough for her to enter into those cares - & this thou knows, & I doubt not but she also thinks so. This is her time for opening her heart to the instructions of pure Wisdom - to feel after the operations of the Divine hand, humbling & contriting her spirit, breaking the little clods of earth (the world) & preparing her mind for the reception of the seed of the kingdom, that it may grow up a plant of renown in her, & in due season bring forth fruit meet for the husbandman who has condescended to water, prune & dress - When she happily finds favour in the sight of Heaven, best Wisdom will be her counsellor on every most important occasion & Almighty help Power will be her help in every difficulty. She will not let the eye of her mind out to the splendor of the world, nor its riches, nor be taken with superficial appearances, but when she is sought for in a fair & honourable manner, she will take the advice not only of her parents & friends, but ask counsel of the divine Oracle, consult the guide of her youth, & in all humility spread the matter before Him who at one view sees the past, present & future, & only knows what will be best for us in every respect. How happy for young people to have such a Counsellor, such a Friend to apply to in cases of such great consequence & uncertainty! Surely it is their greatest interest early & earnestly to solicit, & diligently cultivate a near acquaintance & intercourse with [H]him who is so able, & at the same time so willing to help His humble votaries, who have resigned without reserve themselves & all that they have to His holy protection & disposal. ++++
