the latter is the most likely
reason for contrariness, for
when, having given up the
bridge as a hopeless case,
we tried the river, she was
just as refractroy. I did
succeed in getting half across
but the stupid thing instead
of proceeding, repented I
suppose, and turned back
again. At last after nearly
half an hour's [unclear]vain[/unclear] exertions
we called to our aid some workmen
who managed her for us.
After all our trouble, the
Dargle won and would
not allow a donkey in
so we had our journey I
may say for nothing, indeed
it was most provoking, how
ever we had plenty of laughing
to compensate for our disappointment.
