I suppose you are now fit to be seen, & I am positive if you carry yourself
upright that you will be a greater man than your Father, &
will be an honour to your family - I shall endeavour in my sphere
to promote myself by good conduct, Bob I do not fear, so that I hope
we shall one day or other, all three, make a figure in the world.
++++
I have no more to say only wishing you all imaginable happiness,
[deletion][/deletion] prosperity, & success in this world, & in case of accidents
here, Joy & Happiness everlasting in Heaven, where I hope (if not in
this precarious & uncertain existence) you will meet your truly
loving & ever affectionate Brother.
Saml. Eyre
The following is a copy of advice I rec'd from our old Master
Mr. Shackleton applicable I think to you.
"A military person ought above all to be most distinguished
for [deletion]their[/deletion] [insertion]his[/insertion] piety - Marshal[deletion]l[/deletion] Turenne of France & Col: Gardiner of
England were as famous for their attention to the duties of their church
& their duty to their Creator, as renowned for their courage & conduct in
the service of their king & country - Keep such bright [deletion]examples[/deletion] [insertion]models[/insertion]
of imitation before thy eyes, & never be ashamed to be religious."
Fare, fare you well:
Sam Eyre
