My Dear Friend


        Under a renewd feeling of that Love which often enables me to remember thee as a Father and a Friend, in best fellowship, I am once more emboldend to take up my pen in order to acknowledge the receipt of thine and Dear M Shackeltons affectionate remembrances and to assure you they was, as evry [sic] communication of thine ever hath been, reviving & strengthening, for tho I ever wish to draw my highest consolation from the proper source, yet its truely [sic] comfortable to receive it through the medium of a Beloved Friend & thus, while we are looking through all Gifts both spiritual & temporal to the ever adorable Given, I believe we are permitted with approbation - to cherish that badge of Discipleship even the having Love one towards another, not only to the Children of our Heavenly Father in general, but that some should members of the Body, should feel nearer one to another. Then some others according to their growths & stations, I for the answering of particular purposes, thus my Dear Friend, as an Elder in the Truth thou has felt, thy way opened to a degree of union & sympathy with me who am but a Child, in order that a Door of communication might be experiencd, for thee, to throw many useful hints before me, exceedingly strengthning [sic] & instructive and which hath often proovd as bread cast upon the waters  that hath been found after many days  I write these things in the flowings of that freedom, which is not at our own command & with a view to animate thee, to faithfulness, & a continued waiting on thy Gift, which as it is dwelt with, will keep thee growing in the root even to the latest period, & make thee a constant blessing to the Church at large, & to individuals where thy lot may be cast - Oh how dignified are these Servants in the Lords house, who by constant watchfulness, & prayer, are enabled to make example & precept harmonize  pray for me my Dear Friend, who am a poor feeble Child, that whilst I am at times lead to view the Vineyards of others, my own may not be neglected, for I often conclude that those that travel in order to promote Truth & Righteousness, are likely to gain as much, or preach as loudly, by an uniform steady gathering to the Root of Life, as by precept, & indeed it is by this constant centering that all true ability is received, to move in acceptable service 
        I wishd to have wrote thee before my leaving home, with a desire to share thy sympathy & prayers in the engagement before us of Ann Summerland, & myself setting out the 2nd of this month, in order to pay a Religious Visit to Friends in Scotland and some of the Northren Countys [sic] - it has been a subject of close thoughtfulness to us both for some years past, that tho deeply trying to myself to leave my near & Dear Connections at home, we are thankful in a hope of having waited the right time, & been strengthened to set out, trusting that a blessing may go with us, even that of preservation, which is all we aske - and it is a great favour to me, to go under the wing of so valuable a Companion, & I hope I may be helpd to make travilling [sic] less difficult to her, at her advanced age, by tender attention, & endeavouring to do my own part of the work  we have nearly gone through the County of Cheshire, and are going to take a part of Lancashire  we travel in one horse Chaise, my Companion being unable to ride on Horseback, & this is an excuse for me on the present occasion  my Brother & Sister Reynolds Brother Darby & Sister S Darby, are all in London, by whom I find thou art not there, which will be a considerable dissapointment [sic] to thy Friends at Sunniside. I felt much in the prospect of being absent, when I apprehended thou would be there 
        If Anna Travener is still in mutability I should be glad thou would convey affectionate sympathy, which the account of her patient sufferings has from time to time raised in me, but whether this sickness is unto Death or like Lazarus, for the Glory of God. there is no doubt with me, but these light afflictions which are but for a moment, will work for her a far more exceeding & Eternal weight of glory my Dear Companion joins me in dear love, and thine  which Concludes me thy sincer[e] Friend  Deborah Darby
