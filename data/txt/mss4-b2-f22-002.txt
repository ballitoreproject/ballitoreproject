Clonmel, 2 month 14th 1786.

My dear Grandfather,

I am much obliged for thy kind Letter, and for thy good advice. I have not got into Latin yet, my Father thought it best to put me in French, that I might learn to pronounce that language properly whilst I am young. We are all pretty well at present, only my little sister Eliza who is very weakly and had a sore Mouth lately. We were very glad of my Aunt Sarahs company.

Please to present my dear love to my Grandmother, my Uncle, Aunts, and Cousins, in which my Brother and Sisters desire to join.

I am dear Grandfather, thy dutiful grandson Abraham Grubb.
