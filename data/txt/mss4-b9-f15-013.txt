Dear Sarah
I received thy letter which
was truly acceptable; it seemed as if
we again met to conversed, only that I
had not the opportunity of returning back
what I thought & felt. I heartily
thank you for inviting us; we all enjoyed
the day exceedingly. Thy reflection on
it was precisely the same as I made
myself; that it seemed when it was
over as if we only met & parted.'
I send thee along with this three newspapers,
dated respectively, the 16th., 17th- &
21st containing speeches made at the
Deaf & Dumb Meeting. Doctor Copen's
is to be continued. I shall send the continuation
by the next opportunity after
publication. I would be obliged by thy
returning the paper containing O'Donnell's
speech, when you have all read it, as
I could only get two copies of it, & Joseph
Humphreys is going to send one to London. I
send thee also the American Magazine. I have
Sarah Leadbeater
Ballitore

I sent thee the 12th number of the "Friend
of Peace"? I believe not, if I can get
it, I shall send it in this parcel. -
Tell sister Lydia I shall write to
her soon - We had hardly time to speak
at Paula ponea, but I hope I shall
soon see you [underline]where[/underline] I would rather
see you than any where else, & [deletion]where[/deletion] [insertion][underline]when[/underline][/insertion]
I shall have [underline]leisure to enjoy myself[/underline]-
With love to you all
I remain thy sincere friend
Thomas Fisher
It is raining now pretty heavily, so as I
cannot go out, I may as well go on talking.
The Quaternion will meet next 6[underline]th[/underline]
day evening for the last time - for several
months at least, as Joseph Humphreys
goes next second day. I have not seen
Copen this long time. I hope I shall,
before he goes. The Deaf & Dumb Report
is published; I suppose he will send
it to you. I hope thy uncle is getting
better - Didst thou tell Deborah to
write to me? My uncle Fennell went to
Limerick to vote for Vischer; which is
really carrying his zeal for what he calls
[underline]loyalty[/underline] too far: The man he votes against
is not a party man; but because he
is not a mere tool of ministers to vote
always on their side; my uncle votes against
him. Must every Quaker be
a [underline]loyal[/underline] man? - I believe the only
loyalty which becomes us is passive
loyalty, that is obedience [deletion]& patient[/deletion]
to the laws where our conscience allows
us, & patient submission to the consequences
where it does not. - Hast
thou read the critique on Chalmers,
& what dost thou think of it? I believe
thou hast not read any of his writings.
half past 3 - I have since found out that
the 12[underline]th[/underline] no. of the "Friend of Peace" is at
Rathmines; I shall send it as soon as I
can. Farewell till we meet.
