Dear Aunt
Thy last by way of Shipton Free. I Irecd. & would have
Answer'd before this, but deferr'd it till I Could give thee an
Agreable answer in respect to Brors. proceedings with H. Wilson
Which has but been Dilatory; by reason a Considerable part
of the Summer was lost by her accompanying her Sister Rachel
on a long journey, in a Visit to Friends in ye. West of England
London Norwich &c. And as Winter is not so suitable [deletion]to[/deletion]
To Accomplish their Intentions, there apears nothing to the
Contrary but it may be perfected Early next Summer Phaps
By the Middle of the 3d Mo.; & [deletion]h[/deletion]as I have been Inform'd those.
past some Thoughts of Coming to reside in Thy Native Country,
I Believe Bror. would be pleas'd with thy Company at ye. aproaching
Solemnity if it may Consist with thy Circumstances; but wether
it may or not I do asure sure thee we shall be glad of thy Company
here awhile before thee art setled. -
I with the rest of our Family are at present thro' mercy favour'd
with pretty good Health; Excepting poor Sister Deby who has
Been Extream ill of a very Violent Fever; that we were for
some weeks in dountfull Apprehensions abt. her which was
the Most material Cause I delay'd writing, till I could give thee
Information of her Recovery, but as Mother joins me in this
I refer thee to hers for particulars she attending her most part
of her Illness, but hopes these may find thee with my Cousn. enjoying
a good share of Health, that most Eligible & valuable Blessing
So Concludes with mine & Brors. Dr. Love to thee & Cousins
from thy Affectionate Nephew
Danl. Barnard
P.S. my kind love & respects to Cos. Richd.
& his Wife & say in thy next how
how many Children they have D.B.
