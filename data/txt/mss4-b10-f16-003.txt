To be by taste's and fashion's laws
the favourite of this fickle day;
To win the drawing room's applause,
To strike to startle and display,
And give effect, would seem the aim
of most who bear the Poet's name.
For this, one idol of the hour,
Brilliant and sparkling as the beams
Of the glad Sun, culls every flower,
And scatters round dews, gems and streams,
Until the wearied, [unclear]acting[/unclear] sight,
Is "blasted with excess of light."
Another leads his readers on
With scenery, narrative & tales
of legends wild, and battles won -
of craggy rocks and verdant vales;
Till, always on amazement's brink,
We find we have no time to think.
And last, not least, a master mind,
Around whose proud and haughty brow,
Had he but chosen, might have twin,d
The muses' brightest, greenest bough
Who, would he his own vector be,
Might seize on imortality.
He too, forsooth, with morbid vein,
Must fling a glorious fame away;
Instruction and delight disdain,
and [unclear]makers[/unclear] own, yet loathe his sway;
From Helicon he might have quaffed
Yet turned to Acheron's deadly draft.
O Shame and Glory of our age!
With talents such as scarcely met
in bard before: thy magic page
Who can peruse without regret?
Or think, with cold unpitying view
Of what thou are, and mightst have been,
Dear Eliza
The attached verses are by the American
[insertion]Quaker[/insertion] Poet Barton, we have got the new Endinburgh Review
which has an article headed, Quaker Poetry,
in which it speaks very favourably of Barton.
The beginning of the article is in these words 'Though there is much that is pleasing in this
little volume, the thing that has pleased us most about it, is to learn that it is the work of a
Quaker; - and that, not merely because a Quaker Poet is a natural curiosity, but because
it is gratifying to find that the most tolerant and philanthropic and blameless of our sectories
are beginning to recommend themselves by graces of elegant literature, and to think it lawful

to be distinguished for their successful cultivation of letters, as well as
Sciences.
I guessed RD Webb at meeting though I got no discription of him.
I suppose you have heard of the new Education Seociety that was formed
here, they had their meeting at the Rotunda on Friday, then they elected
a committee. They disdain all meddling with the religious opinions
of any one. they will have another meeting in four Months to see
how they are getting on with the funds necessarry for conducting it.
I hope it may prosper, for if it was nothing but the opposition it would occasion
with they Other Society it would be of use. My Father I believe intends transferring
his subscription to it; but he thinks the Clergy have to much to do with
it.
I have read Kenilworth which I think is fully equal[deletion]l[/deletion] to any of them
for description and deliniation of character, but there is no character in it,
on which you would dwell with pleasure after you had read it.
The moral seems to be to shew the dangers which insincerity and duplicity
well lead a man if he [insertion]once[/insertion] practices it. If you can get the Lounger, there
is a paper in the 2nd Volume that explains admirably the ill effects
of novel reading which I think you would like to read
Edward read it out on Sunday night with his usual discrimination.
Eliza and Richard were speaking one night you were
here of Edwards want of communicativeness if there is such a word,
now I think his manner of answering questions proceeds unawares to
him from his principles with respect to Self instruction, which I have

heard him express; he knowing from his own code what Self instruction
will attain considers it better that a person Should find out
things for himself than be told them by others, as it will lead to greater
activity of mind 'give a person but a motive, says he, to acquire [deletion][/deletion] [insertion]knowledge[/insertion]
and he will acquire it much easier than without it and any new
thought that he does learn, [insertion]he[/insertion] will have a much greater pleasure in
knowing from its being the birth of his own mind.'
I am almost ashamed to make an excuse for not writing sooner,
but the more a person's time is taken up with that kind of employment
which require only activity of body and not of mind
the [unclear]more[/unclear] difficult it is for [deletion]t[/deletion]him to excite his mind to any [unclear][/unclear]
of [unclear]thought which[/unclear] even a letter cannot be written without; and I [unclear]know[/unclear]
no person whose time is mostly [deletion]employed[/deletion] taken up with that
kind of employment can ever become [insertion]as great[/insertion] an intellectual character
as he whose employment requires more exertion of the mind than
of the body.
I am sorry to hear Ebenezer is not well I hope he will soon recover
to ease the disquietude of all those friends by whom he is esteemed
I do not know that I have any domestick news to tell you of
I remain yours
