London 5 mo 30th 1797
My dear Cousin
I should be sorry to let the friends
from your Country depart, without an acknowledgement
of thy short, but truly acceptable Letter - I had not a
doubt but my last to thee would be received in that Love
which dictated it; & that the freedom in which it was
written would meet your approbation - We are far from
thinking " your proposal originated in weakness," or want
of dependance upon that Hand, which had hitherto sustained
& will I trust be your support. The account I heard
this morning from Ireland is very affonting! Worthy
Joseph Inman & his Wife, I understand were obliged to
leave their own Habitation & remove to Dublin - when oppy
offers, our dear Love & sympathy attends them.
I had pleased myself with the expectation of seeing my
dear Cousin Sarah Shackleton here; from her I hoped to have
had a more particular account of my Dear Relations in your land,
for whom I feel great affection and sympathy [deletion][/deletion]; you
are often the subject of our Conversation; as it does not seem
likely we should soon meet, yet, whilst favoured
with an opportunity of conversing in this manner

I hope we shall each avail ourselves of it; I need not tell
thee, my dear cousin, that it will be very satisfactory to
hear from you, more especially in these [underline][/underline]trying times[underline][/underline]—we do
feel ourselves nearly interested in your welfare
Please to remember us affectionately to thy worthy Mother,
tell her, we often think and talk of her, & were pleased to
hear she was enabled to attend the Meetings in Dublin—
The removal of her old friend Elizabeth Pike, would be
affecting to her, I doubt not—our dear love to cousins
Sarah, Abram, Lydia, & their dear children
I have sat down several times to this poor [unclear][/unclear]serane[unclear][/unclear], having
had many interruptions, which must plead my excuse
Thou wilt excuse my enlarging, having heard the friends
leave town sooner than I expected—
My Husband writes in dear Love to thee & thine, & to your
dear Children with thy truly affectionate Cousin
Sarah Birkbeck
