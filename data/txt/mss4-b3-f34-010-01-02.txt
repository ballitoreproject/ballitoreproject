Ballitore 17/1 month 1792


My dear friend,
        Thou expected that thy last kind, acceptable letter would have met me at home, enjoying my domestick comforts, with which good & gracious Providence hath abundantly favoured me  but I believe I was abroad, when that messenger visited my habitation. Anna Taverner, a dear friend, found a concern to join Friends on the family-visit through the wise, extensive monthly meeting of Mountmelick  I had been there already, & there repeatedly-knew by cutting, feeling experience what sort of service it was  but this beloved child must be encouraged & assisted  so I accompanied her in the freedom, as a thing that seemed reasonable & proper. We were mercifully helped along every way  our province meeting at Castledermot intervened  we diverted to it  & reverted to our business  which I think has been pretty fully completed. We had along with us occasionally at different time & places, J.G & his son John, J.C. M.B. & his wife  I think these had all their part in the work  & indeed were mostly better furnished than I expected  but the last mentioned dear creature (perhaps) exceeded us all, & I believe exceeded herself & her own expectation. I have not heard of her breaking out in such a manner before  there seemed to me to be the pure, limpid stream of Gospel-ministry in it & her words were indeed fitly spoken  the matter, in my apprehension, exceedingly pertinent & close  & delivered in ^as^ apt ^ suitable terms  as a Fothergill would be likely to employ. So here is cause of rejoicing in heaven & on earth  for the church militant & triumphant act in unison  I returned home 9th instant & found our families in general tolerably well. +++
When Annas present prospect of service was over, she purposed to return to Limerick, & give up her certificate  but was disappointed of the opportunity, so she came with me to Ballitore, & has been prevented going farther by indisposition of her own  +++ Our Sally was very desirous of seeing her dear friend Samuel Neale, who we understand has been dangerously ill, & to console ^(if practicable)^ her cousin E Penrose under her grievous [page number] 140 trial. Sally proposed also to be with her sister Grubb at her expected time of confinement & increase. So she is likely to have her heart, head & hands full abroad  & yet we want her much at home, her company being very necessary here, & very desirable. She is a good lass (I trust) simple & unaffected, much reduced as to self, waits in deep humility for the fresh anointing, & evidently moves under the influence of it. This I mention, as I know thy heart is connected with the prosperity of this glorious cause, & that thy friendship for her fathers house interests thee in the welfare of every member of it. Thou hast doubtless heard, or wilt soon hear of the sort trial, which has happened at Anne Shannons in Mountmelick  her little niece going too near the fire the 13th instant was so burned that she died next morning. What distress will the poor parents & aunt be in! Here the balm of hurt minds, the solid comfort of religious feelings will be found the only effectual refuge & support  & these I hope will be their happy experience  & that the varied dispensations of the Rod & the Staff administered in infinite wisdom will tend to the ^refinement &^ improvement of these two valuable sisters, & to their preparation of for greater degrees of ductility & unreserved obedience. ++++
        It is a day indeed, as the prophet said, of trouble, & of treading down, & of perplexity, ^breaking^ treading down the walls, &c  It is a day in which the living should travail deeply, stand firmly & unitedly, & act zealously under the influence & direction of their heavenly law-giver [sic no closed quote]  There is a report that that golden pipe Catherine Phillips is restored & refitted, & again made to empty the golden oil  What hearest thou of this matter? Poor, dear Mary Merryweather is no more: her husband lately forwarded ^to^ me a letter which she had left with him for that purpose  it is a melancholy pleasure that her last epistolary performance (I suppose) was addressed to me. +++++ My beloved friend, farewell
        Richard Shackleton
