Ballitore 18/1 - 1876
My dear Emily, June &
Lucy
Had I been able Ellen
& I would have gone to see
you, but I could not even
write until now. I have
lost another dear old friend,
& I feel it tho' I never expected
pected to see him again
He has been happily released
lease from a very tried
state, but you, his loving,
& beloved children must
keenly feel the separation

from the object of so much
tender & assiduous case.
It must be a consolation
to you that you did so
& never left him alone
I sympathizise most truly
with you for I do not
forget my own sorrow
at losing my parents,
& know that it will be
long [unclear]er[/unclear]the the wound shall
close. I do not think
my dear friend was ever
the same since he was
bereft of your beloved

mother, she was a fine
wife & excellent mother.
I loved her dearly from
her youth - her affections
were strong &
sincere, but I need
not enlarge. your
aunt [unclear]Herry[/unclear] must
feel this fresh severance
of early this, my dear
love awaits her.
Ellen desires to have
her love & sympathy
offered to you. she [insertion]too[/insertion] lost
a good & tender father.
your very afft old friend
Eliz Cole
