Dear Friend
        Though I have been often led to remember thee since thy visit here in a degree of that love which first united our Spirits in gospel fellowship and when permitted to feel a little of the flowings forth of those streams that make glad the heritage of God, I have at these seasons felt an Inclination to Salute thee this way but as these times of favour are not often my portion but rather an inward sense of much barreness [sic]I am ready to conclude  I have nothing to spare worth offering to another so have put it off till now indeed a mournful there hath prevented which hath so deeply affected my mind with heart felt grief that its [sic] ready to arise above all other feelings the permission of Unering [sic] Wisdom respecting my late dear friend E Lovell & the young Man that was with her, at the hearing of which silent astonishment with secret tears and deep inward [illegible] of soul seemed to be my clothing for many days in much tender near simpathy [sic] for her Husband & Children and oh for the Cause She was I have not the least doubt rightly called to & engaged in the searching of heart I have and yet do feel cannot be set forth in word. was [sic] also fearfull [sic] it might add to poor Roberts [sic] distress if he reflected that she was not permitted to go when it first appeared to be her duty which I know hurt him at the time, but was thankfull [sic] to receive

Letter will [?] my dear Aunts I hope thou hast got safeand now my dear friend unless I give thee some better account of ^my^ late short Journey I am so poor I know not what to fill up my paper with and as thou dost not like much blank prehaps [sic] it will please thee better then [sic] nothing so may inform thee I was aboute [sic] that time got into a very low spat [?] and under much discouragement of mind respecting that important Work I had in time past apprehended I was called into when my beloved friend E Tuke who has often been made Instrumental of good to me as well as to many others was so at that time by stirring up or puting [sic] in rememberance [sic] again what had long been before the view of my mind She believing it to be the right time to pay a family visit to friends in their Citty made the proposal and then found her mind engaged to inform me of it which came so close I was fearfull [sic] of puting [sic] it from me any longer so with my Husband Uncl [sic] & Aunts consent laid it before my Bretheren [sic] our monthly Meeting being just at hand [illegible] their prayers that I might not go before or stay behind my only true guide for I went forth in much weakness [?] and could see but very little, so having a Certificate that did not limet [sic] me to any part of the County set forward same week being accompanied by my Husband to York who left me there after staying their quarterly Meeting which to me was rather above time yet I hope some would be profitably instructed, on first day morning following the visit to the families was again mentioned and it appearing acceptable to friends and Tabby Haibend [?] being there to gain me therein we began in the Evining [sic] at our lodgings in which favourd [sic] opportunety [sic] I trust the love of our HEavenly Father was felt to bow every mind then present, and in receiving the beautifull [sic] plantation of my worthy friend was lead fervently to pray that the fence might never be broken, nor one of the stakes removed, it was a time of rneweing our love as Children of on Father in [illegible] the Divine Author & one towards another. were favourd [sic] through close labour to get through by that day week having the Company of thy Country Man, with our [illegible} her Children as they thought but & I believe were well received and left an open door to all that opened it to

in the removal of our beloved M Beheniore [?] but surely the Righteous Judge doth right & saw meet to call her home before an event come out that would have been cause of deep sorrow to her mind, her Father being lately become a Bankrupt who indeed I greatly pit tho fear some blame is due but from this digression shall go back to say we had ^an^ & Evening Meeting there where many of the people who profess not with us came which brought much exercise over my mind for some time but was enabled to discharge my duty and favourd [sic] with peaceRobert Grub [sic] left us next morning for York & we proceeded to Hull under some apprehention [sic] of like engagement there but said nothing of it being desireous [sic] to sit their Meeting first in which my mind was so dismayed at the prospect that I
