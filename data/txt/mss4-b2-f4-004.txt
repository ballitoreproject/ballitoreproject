Hanford 4 month 4th. 1788.

Dear Cousin,
	The Yearly Meeting is fast approaching, which most of this Family have thought of attending; & where to meet you, should Providence so favour, will, we trust, add to our Satisfaction; but whether we be so favoured or not, my Wife & I are both inclined thus previously to salute you, to acknowledge the receipt of Cousins acceptable Letter, dated 27/11 month & to inform you that the Blessing of Health is mercifully continued to us; may we ^conscious of our unworthiness^ be made still more humble & more grateful; rightly using, not abusing the manifold Favours bestowed; [word crossed out] Our Sister Margaret Bradford, Morriss Aunt, is much recovered; she is going to pay Cousin Sarah Stephenson a visit at Melksham, from thence to London, & back thither; Our two Nieces from Ulverstone are here; at the time thy Letter reached Hanford I was out, with my Son on a general Visit to our Relations in the North, when Brother & Sister Fell kindly permitted us to bring them away, almost 300 Miles; the more kind being now their all; it was a precious Charge, they are, however, a very agreeable acquisition to our Family; after the Meeting they go into Norfolk, to see their Uncle & Aunt Birkbeck John & Martha at Lynn, & return hither again; we are also expecting Brother Samuel Bradford after the Yearly Meeting -- Besides the above & several lesser Journies since I saw thee, I also have been allowed to accompany some of my Betters, under appointment of the Yearly Meeting. to the Monthly & Quarterly Meetings in divers of the Southern Counties, as Surrey, Sussex, part of Hampshire & Kent; this took me near 7 weeks from home; our number was various, but generally Eight or more; namely Thomas Corbyn, Thomas Hull, Joseph Docwra, Joseph Row, Robert Edes, Robert Horsenail, Richard Baker, William Cowper; [illegible] three of the latter did not go through Kent, it being their own County; Jeremy Waring senior was our very acceptable companion for a while in the beginning & on my return I staid two Nights with him at his Son-in-law Finchs, near Egham, at whose House he now resides: I think he grows ^stronger in the Faith,^ more lively & fresh, as his outward Man decays; Our antient Friend Thomas Corbyn too holds out wonderfully: Henry Wilkins, of whose sudden removal thou probably hast been informed [paper folded] he was prevented by a fit of the Gout, from which I understand he pretty well recovered; being desirous to know how we proceeded, & faced by the way, I wrote him a pretty circumstantial account at our return; which, on hearing of his decease I was glad I had not neglected; he was in my Estimation an Elder truly worthy of double Honour, & as a faithful Servant, is entered into the Joy of his Lord, I doubt not; I loved him, & much regret the Loss; he hath left few his Equals in these Parts; & according to our weak apprehensions can be but ill spared. yet, if a Sparrow fall not without Notice, the removal of such certainly is in the true [?] order of Providence.
-- Our distance from the Metropolis ^the center of Intelligence,^ often prevents our early knowledge of Things that might be acceptable to our Friends & selves, whilst fresh, which at times discourages our Communication; yet, though perhaps out of season, as thou hast enquired particularly about the French & Guernsey Friends, I intend to transmit a Copy of a Letter, dated the 18th of 2 month from de Marsillac to our mutual Friend John Eliot, giving account how Liberty of Worship, &c. has been obtained for them, in common with other dissenters; which it seems was strongly opposed by the Calvinists who wanted to enjoy the Privileges exclusively; this attempt, made there, in a Catholic Country, confirms the opinion I have long entertained not to be uncharitable but true, That rigid Presbyterians are more intolerant than Roman Catholics -- The Number of Friends in Guernsey continues to be small, only Four I think that are received into Membership, one Woman having removed, with her Husband, to London, leaving another only & Three Men on the Island: Nicholas Nastel [?], the youngest, about 26, came over intending to be at the last Quarterly Meeting, held at Salisbury for Hampshire; but, landing at Exmouth, was prevented reaching in time, by snow; I met him at Ringwood a few days after, & accompanied him to Fordingbridge & Salisbury, visiting most if not all the Friends Families at each Place; after which he & John Merryweather favoured us with their Company at Hanford two Nights; he is an agreeable &, I think, a solid young Man; I have had a pretty Letter from him since his return home. It is likely you are informed that the Friends sailed for Holland more than a Month ago; viz.t Robert & Sarah Grubb, Mary Dudley, George & Sarah Dilwyn; intending to go through some part of Germany in France where John Eliot & Ady Bellamy ^do^ still hold themselves in readiness to meet them ^there^ if desired: J. de Marcillac is informed of their Intention: I do not hear that our valued Friend Rebecca Jones has any Prospect that Way, but I shall [word crossed out] be neither surprized nor sorry if she find a like Engagement. She has been in & about London sometime past; she was lately joined by her endeared Christiana Hustler; in what particular service I have not learned, but should they be with Ady Bellamy & John Eliot be added to the little Army already gone, such an Alarum will be sounded as hath not lately, been if ever, been heard in France -- We have had comfortable accounts of late, I think, from our Relations in every Quarter, North & South, East & West; at Settle there is little alteration save the addition of a Daughter, Hannah, to Cousin Johns Family; Brother & Sister Fell have been enabled to bear the Loss of their Son with becoming resignation; we frequently hear from them, more especially since our acquisition of their Daughters; Brother & Sister at Lynn have a Son, Henry, more than 6 Months old; by Letter just received we may expect them here soon after the Yearly Meeting: Our dear aged Aunt Forster of Tottenham, holds out wonderfully, her Years & past Exercizes [sic] considered; which is a great Favour & satisfaction to her Family & Friends; the Schools I believe continue in their usual state; Cousins Sarah & Jane, the oldest Daughters still reside in Bishopsgate Street, but are not expected to remain together much longer; if report be true, Jane is on the eve of Matrimony with a Friend named Elgar, a Shopkeeper in Windsor; he is a Widower, having Children; we understand this to be no sudden hasty affair, but the renewal only of an old attachment; & we think, as it seems not an unsuitable match, if she do at length incline to marry, procrastination would now be wrong; I believe she will make a prudent & affectionate Wife & Step-mother; Cousin Mary Fairbank intends to be at the Yearly Meeting; Uncle William Dillworth is surprizingly recovered from a second Paralytic Stroke which he had about a Month since, whilst on a Visit at Kendal; excepting the removal of Cousin Bella Wakefield, who had long been consumptive, the Families there are much as usual; at Lancaster also, only Brother Samuel Bradford, during Sister Marys Absence lives with Aunt Sarah & Cousin Lydia Dillworth; Aunt is tolerably for one above 80. Notwithstanding the salutary advices & cautions so frequently issued, we have had some disreputable Failures among us lately; John Walliss & John Listers particularly; the former poor Man is dead without any apparent remorse or sorrow for his Misconduct, that I have heard of; his Case indeed, as expressed by a sensible Friend, informing me of his decease, is [word crossed out] observe [?] [illegible] Conduct rather -- The Abolition of the Slave Trade is likely to meet with great Opposition; I trust however that some Good will arise from the pains taken to effect it; at least that some Relief at least be obtained for those now in Bondage, by a mitigation of their sufferings: The Archbishop of York, Lord Hawksbury, with divers interested Individuals have the Effrontery publicly to advocate this most abominable Traffic; those of the latter description are not so much to be wondered at, but that the Archbishop should thus stand forth is astonishing; can it be the the effect of the Hierarchy, or any particular antipathy to the Colour that prompts him? it certainly will be a blot in his Character not easily effaced -- We all are obliged by thy kind Notice of regard, & I hope we shall be favoured with more of thy company this time of coming than the last; to have thee under our roof would greatly add to the enjoyment; though Morris has yet no Wife, he wants not for our Encouragement; & I hope & trust there is a good one in reserve for him, he having no objection we know to the married state -- He is skilful & industrious in his Occupation so far as I am capable of judging; Love to thee & Cousin Elizabeth, (whom we long also to see here) & to all your Children & Connections.
	I am thy truly affectionate Kinsman

Dear Friend/
	I find myself engaged with a pleasing satisfaction to write to thee, to communicate to thee & Friends in England the first events in our affairs in France. --
	Last year during the life of our respectable Minister the Count de Vergennes (whose loss we much regret) we were informed by publick report that the Assembly of the Notables were employed about the means of bestowing on the Protestants of this Kingdom a civil rank or station -- As till then we had been in a manner unknown to the King & his Ministers, we felt ourselves engaged to give them a faithful representation, in order to inform them of our existence as a people, & to solicit for ourselves the same priviledges as were about to be granted to other Protestant Subjects: In consequence whereof, I was commissioned to write the following to the Count de Vergennes.
	The Friends of the Christian Society, called by the scornful name of Quakers, to the Count de Vergennes, Minister of the Kingdom of France.
	As the simplicity of our principles does not permit us to address thee with praises or compliments; we have with joy given thanks to the Almighty, that he has been pleased to afford to the distressed a protector, & to employ the abilities & power which he has entrusted thee with, to contribute to the relief of the sufferings of mankind & to cause the empire of peace and virtue to be established in the World.
	We have learned with respect & satisfaction that our Sovereign intends to grant a civil rank to the Protestants of his Kingdom, & to secure them in all the Priviledges of Citizens, & subjects, but as hitherto our peaceable principles have kept us at a distance from the throne, & we are therefore probably unknown to the Monarch, we have found it our conscientious duty to inform thee that there are in the southern provinces of France, many hundred dutiful subjects, who though they are neither Roman Catholics nor Protestants, yet worship God in those Temples that Jesus & his Apostles did (viz in the inward of their souls) & pursue in reverent silence the [obscured by seal] of Christ only, without any mixture of human innovations.
	On this memorable occasion, we have thought it our duty to address our humble solicitations to thee requesting thee to communicate them to the general Assembly of the Notables, that are appointed to present to the King the humble petitions of his afflicted subjects. We hope that the Spirit of Truth which speaks in the hearts of all that attend to his divine Voice will manifest the innocence of our principles to the Notables, whom the King has appointed to be the dispensers of his justice, & in whom he has deposited his benevolence.
	All the inhabitants of this great Kingdom are equally the children of the Monarch & since we love & respect him as a father & protector, we humbly entreat that his beneficence & that of his Ministers may be extended to us & to all the inhabitants of this Kingdom who are not Roman Catholics. -- We are with respectful affection thy
	assured Friends. --

	The Count de Vergennes answered that he would make a proper use of my observations & desired me to give him a memorial or short account of our civil & religious principles, which I did, & he seemed satisfied with it. The Protestants being alarmed at the steps we had taken strongly solicited that themselves alone might be included in the plan of toleration: but notwithstanding their invectives against us, to which we made no reply, we have partaken of the Kings beneficence, & obtained the same rights & advantages as they, & not only for us but for all sects in the world that maintain good order & peace -- Accordingly in the eleventh month of last year, the King gave forth an Edict, by which all those without distinction who do not profess the Roman Catholic religion are accounted good Citizens & Subjects of the state. Their Marriages, baptisms, & burials acknowledged to be legal, provided a declaration of them is made to a magistrate -- Decent places of burial are granted us, & we are confirmed in all the rights of property, possession & inheritance, the same as the Roman Catholic subjects -- As in the short memorial I gave to the Count of Vergennes I informed him that we did not own any other baptism than that of the Spirit & divine Fire, which regenerates the soul from the defilements of the flesh & saves us by the resurrection of Christ. Peter Ch: III. -- The same Edict provides that where a Child is born belonging to a sect that does not believe in the necessity of baptism, the Father or Mother shall declare the birth to a Magistrate. Such wise laws give us a prospect of peace & of being more free from storms in future, & we are in hopes that our silent worship can alarm nobody, & that we shall not be hindered from meeting together quietly in our houses for the purpose of worshipping the Almighty as we always have done. -- I intended to have sent thee a copy of my memorial to the Assembly of the Notables, as also a Copy at large of the Kings Edict in our behalf, but I declined it on a supposition that the Edict is already known in your Country. Our Friends in the South remain in much the same situation, except that the favours we have received, have made us more inward & humble -- They are all very sensible as well as my self of the tender regard which our Friends in England & America entertain for our little flock; which I expect to visit again next summer if it please the Lord. --
