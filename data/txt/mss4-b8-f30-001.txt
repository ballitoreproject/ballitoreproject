Moonth with us

My dear Williame
No doubt you & my sister will be anxious to know how [unclear][/unclear] is - and
I therefore thought it not improper to incloace her own Letter to you which
will give you a more exact Idea of her present state than perhaps I could
describe it - We hope her own home will work a Change soon in her for
the better - Her mind will be at ease also, & whatever medicine she may take
will have a better effect than it could have were she at a distce. from those
to whom she is so much attach'd - She will also have the Comfort of a
tender Nurse to sooth & caress her in her affliction - So that putting every
thing together we may entertain with God's assistce. a speedy change [deletion][/deletion]
in her favour - Nothing New since you left us - The Country furnishes
no News worth communicating - My Love and aff'tn Regards for your sister
and all the little one's & believe me ever yours
