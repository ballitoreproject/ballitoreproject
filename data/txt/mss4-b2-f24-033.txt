Clonmel 20th of 5 month 1786

My dear Father,

	Abraham is urgent for his letter to go to his Grandfather, which is pretty much composed of his own words, therefore to save a groat I thought I would add on the same sheet; I am in thy debt for two kinds letters, the last from Dublin; it does not appear convenient, or prudent for me to accompany my dear friend M. Dudley to London this year, I think it would require a concurrence of circumstances to make it easy, & particularly leaving the family in health, Elizas state is precarious, & her eye an object of much attention, it would be an affliction to me, for her to lose it, I would like to do all in my power for its preservation, we talk of taking lodgings in Youghal, & trying what bathing her in the Sea would do, Doctor Harris recommends it, she is a constant subject of uneasiness, or however an alloy to other gratifications, but I trust I do not repine, but am humbly thankful for innumerable, unremitted favours I enjoy, & perhaps this dispensation is appointed for my correction, in order to reduce me to a greater degree of submission, a greater degree of watchfulness & deeper searching of heart, if possible, that every thought may be brought into captivity to the obedience of Christ. It was a mark of great kindness in thee to stand Abrahams place, I hope the journey will tend to the ad[seal] ment of his growth, & to the encrease of best knowledge, that so the knowledge of this glory may cover the Earth (the [word crossed out] fluctuating heart) even as the waters cover the Sea: we have all great need of helps, may we cleave to the best helper both at home & abroad! It looks as if sister Hannah could not give up to cross the water, she is quite discouraged in herself about it, I greatly wish our dear honourable friend could go, E: Pike & represent this Nation, such a weighty, wise, steady, valient [sic] Woman I think would be wanting now, I wish those who go may (shall I say?) go accoutred with the whole armour of light ^God^, whereby they may stand boldly & firmly for the cause, the fear of Man being taken away. Our dearly beloved friend & relation ^Sam Pim^ being taken from us was a great surprise, Sister Sally (John) my Husband & I went to the buriel [sic], Sister was not well so did not go to the Grave yard, I did, & was pleased I went, I have a comfortable hope he is entered into rest, I observed (I thought) him growing nearer friends, & more of a friend, I took him to be one who loved the Truth, & I had a secret satisfaction in this contemplation: Providence saw meet to take ^him^ out of the way of further temptations, & snares of this World, & I trust accepted of the sincerity of his intentions: we have lost a kind friend, in losing him. Poor Molly Davis continues very ill, her recovery has a doubtful aspect, her pain at times is great, we hope for her being raised up again, because we desire it, yet it appears amongst the very great uncertainties: My Mother better again.
Margaret is thriving well on her change of Nurse, my anxiety about Eliza I believe helped to injure my suck. I am quite satisfied with the change, how is my poor sister getting on with her Nursing? I hope she will not lay too many burdens on herself, the Nurse in the house ought to relieve her all she can about the care of the Child, if gratitude be in their breasts, it ought to be in hers to my sister. How is sister Lydia & Ebenezer? my dear love to her & to you all, I want to write to Sally I received her letter by Becky. Please give our dear love ^to^ Betsy Pim.
My Husband unites in dear love & duty to thee & Mother, perhaps we may see you here this Summer, it is long since Mother was here. The friends got home well from Dublin, except Robert Dudley not yet returned I believe. I hope soon to hear from thee, may tell Ephram Boake his ^son^ was well, also Abby Widdows that ^E:^ Pope was well also. I remain thy affectionate daughter
	Margaret Grubb
