Ballitore 12th of 2nd month 1782

Dear friend
+++ Perhaps I went too far in saying that Horrour is peculiar to death of every kindbut am not certain. I allow a good many may expect and wish for death, and not dread its approach, but welcome it as his release to a happy eternity: and David says, Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil. Yet we are creatures of a mixed composition, body, soul and spirit; and though the spiritual part may rejoice and have hope in the death of the natural, yet I think it does not follow but that the natural part, to which self-preservation is an inseparably adhesive quality, must recoil and shudder at its own dissolutionwhich is all I meant by the word horrourDeath simply is not an evil; but Sin is an evil, and that being removed, the good man cannot fear what does not existThese conjectures would be best exemplified by mens feelings: but no man comes back to relate to us the circumstances attending this narrow and dreary passage +++
	We are pleased that thou and the other friends got well home from the meetingas also that none professing with us happened to be in the Room at the  Fishamble-street when that dreadful disaster befel. I wish that all under our name would decline taking a busy, active part in these Elections. Manifold inconvenience and little advantage often attend a contrary conduct.
 Between 3 & 400 persons being assembled in an upper room belonging to the Musick hall in Fishamble ^to give their votes towards electing a Member for Parliament^ the loft gave way, in consequence of which many received severe injury & some lives were lost.
