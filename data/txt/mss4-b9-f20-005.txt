16th of 6th mo: 1827
My dear E - Henry Allen told me he had a letter
for me - I have not been much in town
since I saw thee & could not got so far
as Aungier street but still have it in my eye
Jane Chandlee has taken Anne to mind the
children & sent off Ally Mohan who seem'd
so very discontented & dissatisfied that she
could not keep her, our tall cousin complain'd
of a head ake & went away to see if she'd get
better so I do not know how all the
changing will end I have at present Jane
Chandlee's a decent girl - Dick is
a married man at last this 15th of 6th mo
the bridal party drove to the Glen in
4 crades at least the youthful part of it
except Edw John & myself who came home
to stick by the staff 13 1/2 couple of us
went to meeting all of course as nice
as hands could make us Then we
are to be 40 in number to dine & many
more to tea poor Jane Malone what a
bustle & hurry she must be in & how
quietly she will lye down to night & say
that all is over, since I wrote the
above, I re'c'd thy letter & money how
very punctual thou art I thought to

have bought the tea for Deb to day but
could not perhaps I may tomorrow
I am beginning to fear not getting to
Ballitore at all this summer I seem
as if I was making game of you
but I always liked to keep it in view
in the hope that I might accomplish it
I heard from Lydia the 2nd time
she was getting on well but suffer'd
much from nursing Rich'd got there
just in time to help to nursetend
We had a prodigreous wedding dinner
two long tables with every delicacy
to be had on them among which
were peas & new potatoes
Henry Allen will give you a full
& true account of all when he
goes home I wish our party
was over, I miss Rose very much
she was here attending to day
I am at Werburgh street now
& mean to send this by noon
Bop Brennan who is going home
to her children dear love to Deb is
she angry with me - for not writing
has my father any notion of
coming to Dublin? my dear
love to him
