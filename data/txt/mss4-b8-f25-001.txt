Dear William
I expect there is a sufficient understanding,
& mutual intention, to do what is reasonable,
that much more explanation is unnecessary; I
only want what I think I should be willing to do,
in such a case, was I to be the Landlord; to receive
the house & concerns, in tenantable order of condition,
& at such a time, as any impartial [insertion]fit [/insertion]person, should
say was proper; there are many things to be done
[underline]by a tenant[/underline] for his own particular accommodation
& fancy, but the substantial parts both in the
house, Yard, & inclosures, which must be given
up to the Landlord, & form the Basis of his rent,
are naturally expected from him; even so, an
improving tenant, will still make it better,
& as my tenure of it, is somewhat different
from many others, it was my wish to increase
the rent, on a good percentage, that there may
be no objection on that ground; the house I
suppose to be pretty dry, yet was it to be now
inhabited, the walls wd soon appear damp,
not being 3 months plasterd - what seems
wanting to the Shop on thy part is only the

the door fitting for it, I need not I expect,
point out any thing about the offices, I will
give the Rack & manger, from this for the
stable, when it is suitable to move to them;
the whole of that ground outside the house
being so sunk by the removal of the earth
will require a good deal of materials to fill
up again; when things are defind properly
between Landlord & tenant, what each expects
& executed accordingly it is the way to make
things comfortable afterwards; wch I wish.
if the premises are in dire state & condition
it is no consideration to me whether I commence
full tenant 1st of 8 mo. or 29th 9 mo. without any
reference to the Cottage [insertion]from that time [/insertion] which I must pay
for till 1st of 11 mo. Thy sincere frd
