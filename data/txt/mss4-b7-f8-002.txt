Santon Barsisa.
When the Officers had received the
Kings answer, they all retired & the princess
remained alone with the Hermit. Night being
come the Devil presented himself to the [unclear]Santon[/unclear]
saying - Canst thou let slip so favourable
an opportunity with so charming a Creature
Fear not her telling of the violence you offer
her if she were even so indiscreet as to reveal
it, who will believe her? The court the city
& all the world are too much prepossed on
your favour to give any credit to such a report.
You may do anything unpunished
when arm'd by the great reputation for wisdom
which you have acquired The unfortuna[insertion]te[/insertion]
[unclear]Barsisce[/unclear] was so weak as to hearken to the enemy
of mankind. He approached the princess
took her into his arms, & in a moment cancelld
a virtue of 100 years duration.
He had no sooner perpetrated his crime
than 1000 avenging horrors haunted him
Night & day. He thus accosted the Devil O
Wretch said he tis thou who hast destroyed
me Thou hast encompassed me for a whole
age & endeavoured to seduce me & now
at last thou hast gained thy end. O Santon

Answered the Devil dont reproach me
with the pleasure thou hast enjoyed Thou
mayest repent But what is unhappy for
thee is that the Princess is impregnated
& thy sin will become publick Thou wilt
become the laughing stock of those who
admire & reverence thee at present.
& the King will put thee to an ignominious
death.
Barsisa, terrified by this Discourse
says to the Devil What shall I do to
prevent the publication of my shame.
To hinder the Knowledge of your crime
you ought to commit a fresh one, answerd
the Devil Kill the Princess, bury her at the
corner of the Grotto & when the Kings Messengers
come tomorrow tell them you have
curd her & that she went from the Grotto
very early in the Morning They will believe
you & search for her all over the city
& country the King her father will
be in great pain for her but after several
vain searches it will wear off.

Dear Molly
I hope by this epistle to
make up for my past neglect. I own
I have been greatly to blame in not
answering thy letter but I hope
I will not be so remiss hereafter.
I would have gone to the Mill
last Seventh day unless Sally
desired me to come any day but
seventh day.
Williams gives his love to thee
& desires thee if thou correspond with
A. Forbes to give his love to her (since
he sees Sally neglects him he is
resolved to neglect her)
I am &c
W Rayner
Dont shew this.
