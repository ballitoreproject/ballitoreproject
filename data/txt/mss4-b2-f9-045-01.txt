	++++ I doubt not but  has his buffettings & conflicts as well as other folk. The enemies of our own houses watch their opportunity to hurt & annoy us. The enemies of the cross of Christ, & of the discipline of the church wage & have waged long war with the house of David: but whether it be scripture or not, it is most true that the Lamb & his followers will get the victory. Whoever stands on the bottom and ground of Truth, & keeps in the meek, innocent spirit, will assuredly sooner or later prevail. +++

	The continuance of our Christian society as a light in the world depends much upon the visited youth giving up all, surrendering at discretion, without any capitulating in order to preserve this or that favourite object alive, which ought to be slain. We have many miscarrying wombs, half-baked cakes, flitting morning clouds, & momentary early dews amongst us. All states have their trials & temptations, & in faithfulness or disobedience lies our increasing strength or weakness. Little, trivial circumstances of dress or other light matters are presented by the Enemy to young & tender minds: The sure Friend & Monitor in their bosoms dehorts from entering into the temptation - here the conflict begins - army against army - the free agents have to make the choice whether ^which^ standard they will join - & in this choice is involved their safety, their preservation, & capacity for further growth in holy stability & religious experience. In their making a right choice, & in their diligent waiting for renewed help to preserve in that choice (through Divine mercy) consists their happiness in time & eternity.+++
