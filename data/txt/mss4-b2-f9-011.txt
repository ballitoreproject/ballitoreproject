My dear Cousin,                                                 Ballitore: 28/7 month 1776.
	Through the gracious protection of Divine Providence I got safe & well home to my family 17th instant. I wrote to T: Greer from Liverpool (I believe 13th), set sail 15th from thence, found the generality of my family finely - Joseph Pike & wife had not gone to bed when Sam: Neale, James Abell & I appeared at their door about 12 oclock at night between 16th & 17th. They let us in most readily, next day my kind host, hostess & their niece ^& I^ set off for this place, & the following day we proceeded towards the Province Meeting at Enniscorthy. My Son, daughter Debby & Sally were with me there, my wife staid by the stuff. The English women friends were there, & the Testimony of Truth exalted (as usual) through these first-rate Servants. Thy sister Abby ^& brother Watson^ & Johnny Chandlee were there, as I doubt not she has wrote thee. Abby came to take leave of Peggy the day before she went for Clonmel, for which place Peggy set out 25th with her mother, husband & sister Mary. We have not heard from them since they arrived there. Cousin Sam Carleton went to the Royal-oak with them & returned hither: he has got a sore leg. I hear Johny Thompson of Leighton-bridge is away somewhere from his family these many weeks. I believe poor Abby is put to her shifts. She has leisure (if she has the gift) to repent. I suppose Johny Carleton & his sister Phebe agree pretty well together so far. On 26th I attended the funeral of poor Jonathan Watson at Ballybrumhill: he had been very puny, & declining some time before: I believe there is ground of hope that he has obtained a place of Rest. Dolly had not determined when I last saw her how to dispose of herself, but seemed to incline to stay somewhere in that Quarter. Jonathan had fallen out with his nephew Sam & altered his will before his decease: I believe he has left Sam nothing in the will of much value. Joseph Jacob, Walter White, & James Lucky are Executors. Yet Sam has picked up his crums [?] very well under his uncles wing, & if he behaves well, I believe Dolly will be of further service to him: but I suppose the Rupture was so great, that he quitted his uncles house for some time before he died...among them be it - Robert Lecky took me with him in his post-chaise to & fro between County Carlow & Enniscorthy: he behaved better there I think than could be expected: but he seemed resolved to go on with his Manoeuvres & buildings, &c. How far Providence will permit this Frensy [sic] to transport him I know not, but I rather hope his gracious hand will prevent the dear, good man from running to very great excess. his sons were well, & Jane Watson (Rathrush) finely, & got to Enniscorthy with her son Robert & his wife: these two last I think are improving both in body & mind.
	My dear Cousin, my Journey in England was very agreeable: Sam Neale, Jimmy Abell & I kept together, travelled in carriages, S: N: followed I believe the motion of life, & we followed him: his Testimony in the several places made way in the hearts of people; they flocked much after him to his lodging & haunts in friends families where we were, & when they thereby became acquainted with his companions, they were indeed exceedingly kind, friendly, respectful & affectionate. We were at Meetings at Woodbridge, Norwich, Nottingham, Manchester, Lancaster & Liverpool, saw dear John Griffith about two days before his Exit, & spent a very agreeable season with him in conversation, I am thankful that the Great Master was pleased to allow me this Excursion: it was in many respects so very pleasing & satisfactory, & I got thereby to be acquainted with such a number of valuable, agreeable friends, to whom my spirit has been nearly united. There is a crop of youth in that kingdom that would do an honest friends heart good to know: & I trust they will many of them be preserved & neither neglect nor slight the visitation with which they have been honored.
	Agreeable, honest Jonathan Hill is paying us an acceptable visit here. Its time for me to say something to thee about thy little boy, but I cant with much experimental evidence pronounce a great deal concerning him yet, being myself much a stranger at home: but I may tell thee I have felt much love for him since my Return, & if he be spared to us, & we to him, I expect we will make something of him. My poor dear sister is in the old fashion, was out at Meeting to day. My son fine & steady. I am concerned to hear of Joes indisposition. Do, let us know how he is, & how ye all are. The Parting with Peggy was very twitching to some of us: it was like the cutting of the heart-strings. But Time & use wear off the fine keen edge. I think she has got a worthy honest man for a companion, & they are very fond of each other. It was not likely she would be suffered to stay always with me. I trust Divine Providence has been pleased to condescend to dispose of her, & I ought to rest not only satisfied, but thankful.
	I scribble over what occurs without premeditation. I love to converse with thee. hardly any of my correspondents afford me more pleasure than thou does by Letter: I expect cousin Morris Birkbeck & Sally Hall will accomplish their affair 22 proximo. I believe but few from England will attend, & that they will make very little delay after. What is left of us here salute thee, thy Father & children with much affection, thy Son joining us.
	I am, My Dear Debby,                                     thy very affectionate kinsman
Richard Shackleton
