My dear Cousin,
I am obliged for [unclear]th[/unclear]
[unclear]tion[/unclear] to accompany thee to [unclear]Hoc[/unclear]
& should gladly have accepted [unclear][/unclear]
that my seat was [unclear][/unclear]

Atty [unclear]tre[/unclear]

I had rather die no pain
in Heaven - trouble here
every day - - Providence
will forgive me as he
does other people"
