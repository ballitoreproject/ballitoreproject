Dear John
When I am writing a letter
the hardest part is how to begin
it but once I have it done I
can go on with it well enough
I am translating the [unclear]Incas[/unclear], I have
not got very far in it yet. will
you send for the first volume of
Anacharsis travels again for me
if you please I want to write [deletion]out[/deletion]
something out of it, that I wish
to remember. I am sorry to say that

I lose a great deal of idle minutes
 but I hope I shall [unclear]snend[/unclear] I shall
try. Whe I begin to learn a thing
I find as I go on with it the better
I like it; I am afraid I shall never
have resolution. In what time did
 a Lupus Africanus live, and [unclear]Dyoenicius[/unclear]
the tyrant of Syracuse
I intend reading the Athenian
letters if the do not go in before
I have them finished, I have
read a little of it, Richard
Josiah Lucy Elizabeth Malone and
I went out to walk this morning
to the Dingle, we got fine wet
Was there ever such people as
Achilles Ulysses Agamemnon
or any of those people that are
described in the Iliad or Odysees
or the Eneid? Did you ever read
the Messiah, is it anything like
the death of Abel, I like it
very well, I mean the death of
Abel. I am very much obliged to
 you, for the paper, I will not
use it except in writing to you.
I wonder will we go up the county
Wiclow this summer, if we do I

hope you will be with us, it is
your turn. If you see any fault
in my grammar or writing I hope
you will tell me of it
Write soon to your affectionate
sister
Emily
