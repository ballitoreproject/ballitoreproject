My dear Elizth - I am sorry you should have been so uneasy
about Margaret she had a heavy cold when we came home
but is now quite well - I went to Sally Howe to day
to speak about the bombazine & she gave me a piece
[unclear][/unclear]3/4 of a dark puice almost a brown for 17d a yd. I intend to
send it by RSL that thou may look at it & if thou
likes then may keep it if not send it back again
& I will wait for a brown - I read the book for [unclear]Elria[/unclear]
by [unclear][/unclear] but was out when he call'd so did not see [unclear][/unclear]
I saw Debby Johnson to day & gave her thy message - [unclear][/unclear]
says [underline]Mr Harris[/underline] knows the receipt to be a perfect case
I hope my mother got the [unclear]gum[/unclear] I sent to J Williams
Richd bids me tell my mother to go on being fat & that
he is much obliged to her - Doctor Harvey disappointed
me greatly about D's pill box which he has not yet
sent I suppose he thinks I will not suffer from the
want of the pills he promised to send them in time
for M Richardson but did not however I hope R
will not go without them I forgot to deliver a message
of my aunt Gough's to thee when in Ballitore
[insertion]begging[/insertion] an excuse for not writing to thee but her sight
did not permit her, her dear love was added -
Eliza is to go to Carlow to E [unclear]Eaves[/unclear] ever thing with dear love SB

Dear Mother,
I would be obliged by thy [insertion]enquiring[/insertion] of John Thomas
as to the best method of curing a Horse's knees, wch were
cut by a fall/ John's Horse fell under him last night
& cut her knees very much! John Thomas told me some
time ago [deletion]of[/deletion] a method so that it would not be known
when well. please [deletion]Ed[/deletion] write by return of post. & let me know
what John Thomas says, I know he told me they should
be blistered, which has been done & what next
I forgot, please do not forget enquiring of him
as it is very material to know immediately. - I am
finely. -
Thine &c Richd S. Leadbeater
