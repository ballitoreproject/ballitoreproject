Nice indeed and [unclear][/unclear]
nice indeed and reminded
me greatly of that at Glenagary,
After dinner we girls chatted
by the fire, I wanted Fanny
to return with me on second
day as we wanted her to come
up to our party, but she could
not do so well as her things
were not ready. She has however
promised to come up with
Uncle Francis at the end of the
week and Jane also if she
can.
25th.. We left Dunlavin this
morning at seven O'clock,
altho' they wished we could
have staid longer, which
however we could not do
well as Papa wished us to
return. ~ Polly gave us
