Clonmel 26th of 6 month 1791


My dear Father,


        I would not wonder if thou felt my silence unkind, as I have thought so myself, thy truly valuable letter from England deserving an earlier acknowledgment, the account of thy safe arrival was grateful intelligence, & that thou wert in pretty good health, except a sore eye which Jane Taylor informed me of, I ^hope^ it is also better, Jane gave us particular information about you, I was concerned to hear poor Richard Shackleton did not seem so well as he was, hope the salt-water may prove serviceable again to his health. We hear our Richard is well, Abraham is agreeable in his conduct at home, & we are obliged to my Brother for his improvement; our little Samuel met with an accident last week by a fall; as he was walking, his foot hitting against a stone he fell down, & his forehead, (just over his eye-brow) received a deep cut, which swelled so, as to close up the eye, & he was so hot & uneasy 6th day-night as to prevent my going to our Province meeting in Youthal, next day I observed a thick rash on his skin, which must not proceed I suppose from the wound, but both together made him very heavy & restless, he is now much better, Doctor Harris attends him: our little Robert is better, tho delicate, I believe the fresh Nurse was of service; his first Nurse is about going away the last Nurse is apt to disagree with her, & the other servants, & I have had a troublesome time with em, but must bear for the childs sake; as I cannot converse with his Nurse I am at a loss to convince her what I mean, & she is apt to imagine the servants communications are not what I say; Betsy Pim is pretty well, she did not go to Youghal, we expect sister home soon.
        Our last monthly meeting was held at Garriroan last 4th day thither many of us went, & had some exercise of mind, which I wish may conduce to our spiritual strength, I regretted not going to Youghal, especially as I was named a representative, but I feared to leave poor Sam, lest he should suffer. Anne Broadhead & Betsy Taylor with others are gone.
        Our friends here I think are generally pretty well, James Malone is at Ballyspellen-Span for his health which appeared to decline, but we hear he is better, Tommy Taylor recovering out of a smart fever he has had, which alarmed us greatly, & Tommy Greer (prentice to William Stockdale) is now apprehended to be in one: D: Harris attends them.
        I took notice thou wert with thy Gentile friend, I have been with him too in imagination, for I dream of him, & awake with emotions of friendship & regard for him, perhaps reading some of his book on the Fresh French revolution occasioned my thoughts to be on him, for altho his subject, or his sentiments, may not always tend the right way, ^yet^ his brilliant stile, & lively imagination lead one to admire him.
29th I wrote the foregoing first day, & having the offer of a frank have delayed sending it, which causes me uneasiness, fearing thou wilt impute it to neglect, or insensibility of the favoured ^conferred^ by thy last letter. Since, some of the friends are returned from Youghal, my Uncle Benjamin got some hurt coming home, a Horse Kicked him in his leg, & gave him considerable pain, to reliefe [sic] him therefore, he went into a Cab with sister ^Hannah^, which was overturned; my uncle being under his head was very much hurt & cut, so that (dear Man!) he is laid up, Doctor Dudley attends him, & I believe does not apprehend danger. Anne Broadhead stayed in Youghal to join on a family visit, also Loveday Allen, I suppose by appointment. John Davis of Cork is deceased.Our Samuel is better also Robert much improved, his first Nurse is gone: so I hope we shall get a little settled again in our domestick arrangements: Molly Phillips I believe suitable for me, more so than any other I have had in her place, she is smart & notable, all alive in her feelings, as most clever people have quick sensibilities, but if she continues to be so useful as at present I need not give her offence: she seems to understand ^almost^ every ^necessary^ branch of domestick eoconomy, & is a remarkably smart ^at^ knitting & needle work. 
        I know my dear Mother (as well as thee) would like ^to hear^ how we go on in particulars. Betty Wilson is complaining of cold & looks think her last Child, a very fine one. I believe they are in a very good way of business, & might grow rich if they, (or he) attended to it, (& perhaps he does) I dont hear much complaint of late . Nancy Hughs has lain-in of another Son lately, her eleventh, buried one girl.         My Husband joins me in dear love to thee & Mother William & Mary, & relations over the water, I owe Richard a letter, intend to pay him, he must trust me, as I am often busy working for him, & his Brothers & sisters, his shirts are cut out, & I hope will soon be ready to send him, I often think of him, & much desire he may be a good boy, & learn mind his learning; there is nothing thats good got by idleness
        In books, or work, or healthful play
        Let my first years be past
        That I may give for every day
        Some good account at last.


My dear Father, please to excuse me writing to Richard in thy letter, it just came into my head, & perhaps he may mind it better, for passing thro thee.
        Farewel [sic]. I remain thy
                affectionate daughter
                        Margaret Grubb
