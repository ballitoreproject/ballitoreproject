1st
My Soul ascends in humble Flight
Above these transient woes,
And filled with Songs as in the night
She to the Mountain goes;
2d
With harp & pipe, to celebrate
The praise of Lions King
And with a weaned mind prostrate,
An humble off'ring bring
3d
Prepare the off'ring sacred flame
And consecrate my Ground,
That by the Nature of thy name
Acceptance may be found.
4th
Thy gracious Majesty that deigns,
The Contrite Soul to hear,
Thy wisdom, that for ever reigns
Bid humbled minds draw near,

5th
Shall I refuse then to present
The off'ring of my will
Shall I ungratefully consent
Th' immortal Birth to kill;
6th
Forbid it Lord, '& aid my Soul
The conflicts to endure,
Which through thy merciful Controul
Make all things new & pure,
7th
O grant thy all sustaining Aim
My drooping Mind to bear;
And with thy Consolations warm
Preserve me from Despair
8th
Thou know'st the tribulated Path
Which leads from Death to Life
Thou know'st the banefull Dragons wrath,
His Enmity & Strife.
9th
Thy Light & Truth most gracious God
With hold not from my Soul
Nor yet thy wise chastizing Rod
Nor David's Washing Pool
10th
In Faith & Patience, center deep
The Misteries thou reveals
And with an everlasting Sleep
And thy immortal Seals
11th
Envelope each unworthy View
That sanctified aright,
Thy Glorious Cause I may pursue
And witness to the Light.
12th
Thus thro the few succeeding Steps
Appointed me to run,
Thy Honour may be all in all,
Thy praise alone be sungâ€”
