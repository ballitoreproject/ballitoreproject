My Deare Brother,
This will be handed thee I suppose by Cd Morgan who
intends for Clonmel tomorrow
I forgot in my last to thee mentioning of Peggy Herby's Illness, who
has been these two or three weeks unwell with a kind of Histeric on Convulsion
fits (at times') which seemed to affect her spirits very much for a
time, about two nights ago she went to bed low in her mind, & was not long
before she was taken with them to a very great Pitch untill near morning
during which time her mind was very deeply impressed. She broke forth
in the following manner (or nearly so) 'The lord has led me thro a miry
"Road, & then to a green hill, where I saw at a distance a beautiful
"house, which I went up to, & I when came to the Gate it was beautiful, &
"the Pillars thereof were of white marble, inside there was another Gate
"when I came to, I saw our saviour sitting on his throne, & his looks were
"very innocent he looked downwards at me very innocently, & his countinance
"was innocent & sweet. I saw many people, & they seemed to make
"room for me also many Lambs at his throne, with people on their faces. I
"also saw a dismal dark place, nearly opposite this, which seemed to be as
"a furnace, & I saw an innumerable deal of people Black, & fire coming out
"of them". This was the place [deletion]of[/deletion] [insertion]for[/insertion] the wicked. The former place was Heaven (I
suppose) & the latter Hell, this seemed to be as a vision as she says she saw it
inwardly with her inward eyes, & that she was to turn back again, she hoped
for some good. She also saw a glorious light, such as is impossible
to express by poor mortals, but she cannot help thinking of the latter place
wondering that people's eyes are not opened, & that they will not give up their
hearts to God alone, & not be hastening to that dismal place, but to keep a
conseience clear, cleaning it every day, & that if they would but be humble,
& keep a clear Conscience, that the Lord wou'd do the rest for them, & altho
her bodily pain seems to be great, she says she thinks nothing of that in
comparison

Comparison to what si went thro' in spirit, & that she would go thro' as much
more, If it would bring a sinner to repentance, often devoutly praying for hers
& all the worlds preservation, & giving suitable advice to those present. Thou
mayest think strange of this as we all thought so; but the Lord is able to make
the blind see, the dumb to speak, & the deaf to hear, when they give up the[deletion][/deletion]ir
whole heart to him alone. She speaks to us to avoid vain dress, which takes
away the mind from God. This Eevening I was with her, & she said if
we were to see half what she had seen it would humble us all, She was
in almost constant prayer for about two hours (I believe) praying for her
self to be preserved from temptation or Sin, & for all Sinners, that the
Lord might break their hardened hearts, & show them what she went there
or what she had seen, & then she thinks they never could render enough to the
Almighty, nor serve him too well
If she goes, I believe she will go well, but we can't tell but the Lord may
raise her up to honour and glorify his name, as she says she is willing to
die or live which ever he pleases.
I hope thou & all of us will keep this in our minds not to let it slip our
memory too much but to be plain in Dress as well as speech & behaviour
I cant well tell what I am writing as my heart is so affected from hearing
her, hope it will make a lasting impression on my mind.
wth. dear love I remain
thy lov'd & affectionate Brother
 Thomas Lecky
