endearment & happiness that I believe the conjugal state admits,
being one in heart & spirit, one in sentiment in religious
matters, & temporal concerns; No jar, no uneasy
contradictions or counteractions between us, it was mutually
a pleasure to be first in kindness to each other, we
were each others nearest and dearest bosom friend, in a
natural and sp[deletion]r[/deletion]iritual relation, there being no more
reserve between us, than if we were one person, it was
mutually a pleasure to impart, & communicate our minds
& experiences to each other, wereby indeed we were true
helpmeets to each other, & our society was sweetly agreeable
beyond my seting forth, so that I think our life in a married
state was an example of conjugal felicity; & great
was the care often upon us, to know our love to each other
so bounded & limited, as that we might not rob our heavenly
father of his due: she was to me precious indeed,
a faithful affectionate wife, a true bosom friend, one
that partook in my joys & nearly sympathized in all
my tryals & exercises, inwardly and outwardly, was beyond
expressing tenderly careful of me, & with great pleasure
did whatever was in her power to render my life comfortable
every way, her complisance & unity with me, being so

so entire, that she often expressed she had not a wish for
me to be in any respect different from what I was, which
to be sure was more owing to goodness in her, than merit
in me, but a lass for me! but happy for her, she is gone,
she is removed to take her lot in that blessed inheritance,
which it was her principal concern while here, to be entitled
to, and I have no doubt, nay I am fully in the faith,
she is now in possession of; so that I have not to lament
her departure upon that account, it is on my own account
I mourn, I lament I am so left, so destitute, so
lame, so weak, like a body b[insertion]e[/insertion]reaved of its better half. How
shall I bear up? what shall I do? I can turn my eyes no
where with pleasure, a veil seems to over spread every
part of the creation, that I can not think of living or
staying long here without her; and O may I never forget,
nor one day neglect, ardently to press after those perfections,
that entitle to a portion among the blessed, when
these few weary & afflicting days are over, that we
may meet never more to know what separation meaneth:
O my soul and spirit seems to reach after her, as
if at this instant I embraced her, in a state of unspeakable

unspeakable peace and joy in the holy paradise; in the
sense of which I am overcome, and all that's within
me desires if it be the Lords will, to be now dissolved
& seen of men no more, that I might join her, in singing
the joyful Halleluijah song, that is the employ
of glorified & redeemed spirits for ever and ever.
My endeared friend excuse my writing so much,
I have said but a part of what is in my mind to say
to thee, who has been, & is yet to me a particular friend
but my paper confines me, & perhaps I may write
by the next ship; for this time I bid the affectionately
farewell, remaining with dear love to thee and family,
thy sincere tho lonesome & deeply tried friend

My dear friend,
Elizabeth Wilkinson
It is long, yea very long since I had a line
from thee, and I think it has not been more desireable, it with
the solemn prospect of this being the last time my dear friend
of ever writing to thee I now write. It is now near one year,
since I have been waisting a way with a consumption disorder,
am now so reduced that I have been confined for many weeks
within doors, & have great reason to look for the closing period
before long; it is with more difficulty I now write than
I have before experienced, so that I cannot say a great dale. -
My dear friend my love is to thee in the truth as strong as
ever, & that innocent friendship & nearness continue now in
this trying time with solid satisfaction, pleasing would it
have been to have heard from my dear friend once more,
before I go hence, but I give it up; there does not my dear
friend seem much in my mind to say, I have nothing whereof
to boast, yet have a secret trust that when this earthly
houre shall be dissolved, I shall have a mansion on high,
amongst the many in my heavenly fathers house, may our meet-
