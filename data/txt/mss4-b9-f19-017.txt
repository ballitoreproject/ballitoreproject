My dear [deletion]M[/deletion] Elizabeth
To day I received thy
acceptable letter & one [insertion]likewise[/insertion] from Mary both of which
would be much more so I must confess if they
contain'd fewer commissions, however I intend
going about them tomorrow I have bought the
seeds for Deborah which I will send along with the
poplin & my mothers red ink powder & Indian
rubber by R [unclear]Relville[/unclear] since I am on the [underline]Quay[/underline] of
business I must request thou'lt tell M Shackleton
That I went several times to Cork Hill about
her straw & they still told me that they would
have it the next day Harriet Lefanu says
she thinks she has sold Mary plait but that she
is not paid for it yet.
We dined at Monkstown at T Pims yesterday
& had a delightful ride there only for the
dust & the wind but coming home the Tide was
full in therefore we had a fine view of the sea Inded
I cannot say the view was very fine as it was then
past ten o'clock, however we had the pleasure of
hearing the rolling of the waves over one another
which let me longing to bathe. I would wish
to tell thee about a ride we to took to Dun
Drum to day but I have to incounter both the
darkness of the evening & the ringing of C which
quite sets me asting

I forgot to say that on my return from Monkstown I call'd
to L McFarland & paid 2/6for Deborah she was out herself but I
saw her husband who was busily employed playing backgammon
with a man of the name of George Manger who as soon as he
heard the name Shackleton enquired kindly after you all
said he had gone to school in Ballitore & that the last time he
had seen my aunt Sally was in Gaueney where she went
to preach but unfortunately he was on [unclear]panucle[/unclear] that
day therefore could not go to hear her.
I am greatly afraid I cannot get any flowers for
thee or if I do the worst which would be scarcely worth
[deletion] bringing home, next third day we are to go to
see the College museum & library. I have not seen
the wild beasts yet I think I will enclose this in the bundle
for Ballitore I send a note from [unclear]WRL[/unclear] to my mother he
has not given me A Roberts's papers give my dear love to all
Thy affect. YL. there is scarce any writing with this pen it is so bad
this may plead my excuse
I have just bought thy shoes & MO
it 7/7 per pair I have also bought
1/2 dozen of artificials & put one of
them in thy bonnet which &
is n 8/10 for
Elizabeth Leadbeater
Ballitore
