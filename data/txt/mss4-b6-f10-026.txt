Carlow 31 Mch. 1812
My dear friend
I was pleased to hear thou recd my poor scrool
yesterday - and as I wd wish thou & many others of our frds in Ballitore
to partake of every thing interesting at my command I
thought the enclosed letter from our mutual frd J:H recd this
morning - woud come under that denomination - more especially
that from E:B poor man he has experienced
great affliction in passing along this stormy sea - and
altho his idea of things both here & hereafter are very different
from those entertained by the majority - yet we
cannot wth certainty pronounce him in error - but
must esteem him as a brother beloved - because his conduct
thro' life has been (I believe) uniformly on the side of humanity
& universal benevolence & indeed my friend in my
view - this short creed (if but into effect) woud do more for
the amendment of the people & the promotion of righteousness
on Earth - than all the discordant creeds that ever
have appeared in the world wch. have principally tended
to foment the angriest & most malevolent passions of the
human mind and to make [insertion]use[/insertion] of the sentiments of an elegant

historian on this occasion & wch. indeed my friend I can nearly
adopt - Viz "They give a check to Religion in its happiest principle
"of universal benevolence, they are guards to prevent the
"truth from taking its boldest & wildest range, the advantages
"they produce compensate not their calamities
"and perhaps it woud be fortunate for human affairs,
"if the expense, the formalities, and the abuses of religious
"establishments, were for ever at an end, if society
"were deprived alike of the Scon. Pontiff wth his tiara, the
"stalled bishop, and the mortified presbyter. If no confessions
"& creeds were held out as standards of purity & doctrine;
"If faith & fraternity were left unfettered like philosophy &
"science; if nations were not harnessed in opinions like
"horses to a carriage; and if every mans heart were the
"only temple where he was to worship his God."

I must conclude thy Affte & obgd. friend
