Holywood 8 mo 20th 1809.
My dear Friend
I hasten to reply to thy very acceptable
letter which I received this morning from Lisburn, as my
Father wishes 25 of the "Anecdotes" to be immediately
sent to him; he will dispose of as many as he can, &
the remainder he will put into a booksellers hands,
but he would wish to dispose of a good many himself
as the booksellers charge is so very high - Please
tell Betsy Shackleton I am much obliged to her for her
short letter, & that my Father will write to London this
week for the machines for splitting straw. I will write
to her very soon. The poetry thou sent will be inserted
in the magazine, but the remedy for the bite of a
mad dog will be decided on at the next meeting
of the proprietors - my Father is doubtful about its
insertion, as he thinks nothing is effectual in this
dreadful case except excision with the knife, or
burning with cautery, & that this remedy would only
give delusive hopes & occasion delay, however the
meeting of proprietors will determine about its
insertion. I am glad Ida is not a favorite
if I consulted my own wishes & not propriety - but my dear Friend we
must sometimes attend a little to propriety & fashion - Yesterday we
dined with an uncommon large & splendid party at a gentleman's
in this neighbourhood - We came home very late; but let me be in what
company I will my friends are always in my thoughts, & late as it
was I sat up to write a long letter - In short we bathe; walk about
& perform a round of visits every morning, & are scarcely ever without
company, or visiting in the evening. This all does very well for a little
time, but I wish often for a little quietness - my father sometimes
tells me I do not read as much as I did in Lisburn, but I tell him
that my friends here seem to suppose I agree with them in thinking
the study of books may be sometimes [deletion][/deletion] laid aside to study
"men & manners" - But my dear Friend I tire thee with my
nonsense, & the Letter is so shamefully written & so incorrect
that I am ashamed to send it - With dear love to Betsy
& Mary Shackleton &c &c I am most sincerely thy affectionate
S. Hancock.

at Ballitore, it is worse than silly, for it is dangerous
& in many places highly improper: Dr. Cupples a clergyman
who lives in Lisburn is very intimate with Miss
Owenson; he told me he corrected the manuscript of
the two first Volumes of the Novice of St. Dominick,
& he once took the liberty of speaking to her about coining
words & writing in such pompous language, she replied
that in her writing she always considered the smoothness
of the sentence & the sound, more than the sense; if
this is the case, she has succeeded, & answered her
purpose very well. Once thing I must admire Miss
Owenson for, is her evident partiality to Ireland, &
I am very much prejudiced in favor of my country,
& I hope I shall never live to be otherwise; this
partiality of Miss Owenson's, & that she is an Irishwoman
makes me regret very much that she should so
far forget what is due to her country & to her
sex, as to write in the manner she generally does.
I have read the Memoirs of Klopstock, which
have disappointed me. We have succeeded in borrowing
the "Pieces of Irish History," & the "Memoirs of

Counsellor Sampson, which my Father will send with
the other books thou wishes for, by the next parcel
of Magazines - By a mistake the Magazines from
the beginning of this year, was all that was
sent to the proprietors of the Ballitore Magazine,
but the others will be forwarded with the next
magazines. If the gloves are not already sent the
Ballitore magazines could go with them, & they shall
be returned safe. My Father thinks you would receive
the Belfast Magazine much sooner, if thou thinks
any one would sell them in Ballitore at the allowance
of 10 per Ct. I am much obliged to thee for
prescribing a jaunt to Ballitore [deletion]with[/deletion] [insertion]for[/insertion] me, but
that is out of the question this summer as
we do not intend to leave this place for
some weeks; however we have formed a plan for a
jaunt to Ballitore early next summer, but I sometimes
fear this jaunt resembles a [underline]castle in the air[/underline] -
I am much obliged to your friend W. Lefanu, for
wishing to see me, but I can assure him that to see
me thro' the medium of partial friends, & to see me
as [underline]I really am[/underline] are very different things - There is
very little progress made in printing J. B. Trotter's poems.
Miss Balfour's poems are just to press, & I have seen a

proof sheet of the first half sheet - The book will be entitled
"Hope & other Poems." My Father wishes Abraham Shackleton
to send him the extracts from his journey to England by
the first opportunity - We find Hollywood very pleasant,
our lodgings are a few yards from the sea which makes
our view very pleasant- I bathed nearly two weeks in
the tepid bath; for three days I had large [deletion][/deletion] [insertion]buckets[/insertion] of water thrown
over my head, which was a most uncommon shock, & this week
past I have bathed in the sea - I am a great deal better,
& the unpleasant pain in my head is quite gone, so that
I am quite pleased I attended to the Doctor's wish of having
my hair cropped short, that I might bathe without a
bathing cap - We have some very pleasant acquaintances
here, & some very [underline]stylish[/underline] ones - [deletion]which[/deletion] [insertion]the latter[/insertion] I could dispense with
