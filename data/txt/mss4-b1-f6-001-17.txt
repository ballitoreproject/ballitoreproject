Dear Master /
By my own desire - & ye Approbation of my late
Capt. I am going out to India in this Ship (flag Ship)
with positive assurance of being prefer'd, before ye Expiration
of my servitude if my behavour entitles
me to it. I am strongly recommended - that is
a tacit way of boasting of my own worth as it is not
to be suppos'd Capt: Jervis wou'd recommend me if
I did deserve it. I owe all to him who first formd
my mind & made me a scholar. Consequently if
I have any Gratitude I must thank him as for all
ye benefits &c that I may hereafter reap in consequence
of care that was taken in my Education.
I have written several letters home, upon this
Occasion - Bob will inform you of ye purport of
them - I am in ye utmost hurry so pray excuse
my method of writing & ye writing itself which I
am asham'd of -
