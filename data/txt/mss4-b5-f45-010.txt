Esteemed[underline] Friend,[/underline]
The present is to acquaint thee that
some of the children are arrived here from Dublin. and
more of them are expected next week. but I could yet
ascertain the No. of them that will come to my School.
I have put up some of the Cards and will put
up the rest, they will do very well for sometime, I
have been considering what thou told me with respect
to the Model School, and if thee and thy friends would
approve of it, I would go there myself and I think I would
be able to take of the place in a very short time.
I have drawn some copy's from the Original thee
I have drawn some copy's from the[unclear]bugied[/unclear] thee
has given me and will put them up for the Public. I
have read it for the Scholars and gave them positive
orders to bring the sums as appointed on Monday &
so on every week as now would be admitted on any
account without the money, but on account of change
I gave them liberty to pay as many weeks in advance
I remn, thy Mt. Obd. Servt.
