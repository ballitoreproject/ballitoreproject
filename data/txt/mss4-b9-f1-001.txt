London May 6th 1831
My dear John
I write home this day a hasty
letter, to make amends for which as I have a
few moments to spare I now commence another
tho' when I shall forward it I know not. I want
you to send me a letter as soon as you can to Paris, giving
me [underline]your route[/underline] and directions for a short tour in
Switzerland. We seem now inclined to shorten our
stay in Paris in order of [unclear]possible[/unclear] to see something of
the monarch mountain of Europe. Do not be alarmed
at this, it will not I expect lengthen our stay from
home much, even already I feel an odd qualm
of nostalgia. Tell me then every thing you think
will be of use to us, should we go to that country.
and direct to me Porte Rectanto Paris;
7th Dover - We have travelled this far since 10 oclock
this morning and have had a most interesting drive
We have seen greatest part of the course of the Thames[insertion]to the sea[/insertion]
after leaving London and this country has far exceeded our
[deletion]ou[/deletion] at least my expectation, for beauty and variety. The French
coast appeared to us this evening almost as near as [unclear]Howth[/unclear]
or Lambay. The Packet starts in the morning for Calais at
1/2 past 1 and we hear the Diligence[insertion]goes[/insertion] at 10 so that I 
presume we shall be in Paris on Monday. It seems
strange to me to be in sight of France and still more
so to be going there. When shall we hear from
you again, we have left directions with J Fisher to forward
any letters you may direct to London to us to Paris, but
it will be better for you to direct to Porte Ristant Paris on receipt

of this. [insertion]as[/insertion] It is probable we shall not leave that city
at all events before the 16th Instant. I thought a
deal of you all last night. If Richd has not
heard from C Fausset since our departure, I should
be obliged to pass to him to call to know whether it
is really [unclear]imperative[/unclear] on me to be home before
the 3rd June [insertion]as he said something like that, [/insertion] I should hope it is not. If it be
any information that is required should I be wanting
perhaps I could communicate it by letter at least
let me know how things stand as to this point.
and also whether any thing else has occurred out
of the [unclear][/unclear] course. I hope Rich'd is particular
to [unclear]Secure[/unclear] the fees well spent which can only be
to have the Lees well spent which can only be
done by watching that they do not run them
down too fast and that they are well shined
in [unclear][/unclear] Vat. I left North Goddard free on Coutts of
acceptance and it is [unclear][/unclear] London [unclear][/unclear] of ex
Friend not in docked. I shall I think desire him
to forward it to you unless it appear likely that
I shall want its amount before I return. We
had two long walks for our passports in London
but obtained them early and without expence.
The Zoological gardens exceeded our anticipations
and considering the infancy of the Collection are
extremely well worth seeing. The dromedary of Africa
is a very unique looking animal The Grace[insertion]Grice[/insertion] of
South America is a beautiful creature its head & ne[unclear]ck [/unclear]
like a bull, its limbs and body like a horse. Some of the
Water foul seem in as good health and spirits &
beauty as if they were at large on the lakes and moun[unclear][/unclear]

There are great alterations and improvements taking place
in London particularly about Charing cross, where a vast
number of Houses have been pulled down. New
London bridge is really a magnificent thing, th [deletion][/deletion]
buttresses go a long way into the cities at each side of the
river so that Thames It in the London side and some
other street I think on the Southward side seen under
it by means of two [deletion][/deletion] arches. We have been
in Canterbury Cathedral this evening. They have
dressed it up inside as good if not better than new.
I like the venerable appearance of it out side much
more, particular the cloisters which are [deletion]the[/deletion] most
perfect and highly ornamented. We were shown
the tomb of Edward the Black Prince with the
coat shield & helmet he wore at the Battle of
Cressy. How are your elections going [unclear]on[/unclear]
Liverpool has almost wiped out the [unclear]con[/unclear]
[unclear]Liverpool[/unclear] has almost wiped out the [unclear][/unclear]
stains she had on her, by throwing out Gascoigne
[unclear]stairs[/unclear] she paid on her by throwing out Gascoigne.
Manchester and the midland counties [unclear][/unclear]
England were exceedingly agitated and I [unclear][/unclear]
[unclear]fine[/unclear] continue so still. I do think that of
the questions of Reform [deletion]is[/deletion] [insertion]should[/insertion] not [insertion]be[/insertion] carried there would
be a revolution. And not withstanding all this the
[unclear]Friends[/unclear] seems rather to advance. Sarah mentioned
by my Mother what a fine opportunity went as of
[unclear]seem[/unclear] Broughham. in which we were particularly fortunate
as he held during the June eve looked at less a
conversations with the Solicitor General. I forgot to reply
to Richd' questions about Beuly Cotters in my last. The
bargain I made with them was that he was to take

the five [unclear][/unclear] of Rufus Tallow at 47 [unclear][/unclear] to pay
at least for 2 of them and Send us Cotton & the
Remainder at least [unclear][/unclear] also. It was wrong of
him to lend us so much as he did not [unclear][/unclear]
what fund we should want. Rememb me kindly
to Martha & all & believe me yours as ever affectionate
