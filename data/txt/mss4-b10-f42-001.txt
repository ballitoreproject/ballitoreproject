New York 21 of 10 Month 1818
Dear John
I wrote thee a few lines from Belfast
we saild 30th down Channel the wind chang'd in the night
when we returnd and went out [unclear]a berth[/unclear] about the Children &
myself were from one to two days sick - Betty was very ill
for two weeks that I was apprehensive of the Consequence but by
care and taking Bark daily her stomach was able to bear
light food such as gruel and Eggs the latter was most grateful
to her she was much reduc'd in flesh and strength but now recovering
tho weak - I think the children and myself had as good
health as at any time we arrivd here 16th being 45 days but
not without experiencing some hard weather and the loss
of one of our seamen being [unclear]washd[/unclear] off the Boom in the Storm
the [insertion]night of[/insertion] 27th 9 mo we experienced another more severe the morning
of the 2nd 10 mo I was an eye witness to it being most of the
time on deck (my Idea of a storm was erroneous) I expected
the sea to be mountains high on the contrary it was not
as much so as in a Gale, the sea seemd to [insertion]be[/insertion] kept down by the
violence of the wind and the surface was all spray yet several
times the sea washd over the ship and I was drench'd from head
to foot we were very near losing our foremast the Man [unclear]kept[/unclear]
the Hatchet in his hand to cut it away when a Sea broke
over him and the ship righted; at that time Margaret was
scalded from her ancle to her knee it is now healing tho
she cannot yet get about which is a loss to us all we did
not get out of the ship until second day I met my old acquaintance
John W. Wright here he got us a Room to ourselves for
which we pay 2 dollars p week it is no easy matter to get lodging

here without Board - we are nearly in the Middle of the City which
may be termd the subburbs all round [insertion]us[/insertion] is the trading part near the
two rivers this part was once marshy ground it is now filld up
and setting in lots for Building, Buildings are going on in all
quarters and it is probable in a few years more N York may be
double its [insertion]present[/insertion] size which I think is nearly double that of Cork it is a
great place of Business all is motion very few Idlers no Beggars nor
any of the ragged people we see in [deletion]other[/deletion] [insertion]the[/insertion] towns of Ireland I think without
exception the Carriages [insertion]& Horses[/insertion] for hire are the neatest I ever saw and most of
them elegant vehicles of which there are upwards of 100 there are many
of the Houses of wood but now they build of brick and the rents are
high flesh meat nearly the same as in Dublin the Beef is good but
the mutton inferior Potatoes are higher in price than apples & I
think all vegetables double the price they are in Dublin and not so
good the Cabbage does not head [unclear]mole[/unclear] peas come in all at one time
let them be sewn [deletion][/deletion] [insertion]when they may[/insertion] the people are pale & have a sickly
look except those from the Old Country & they in time lose their complexion
the women dress in shewy colours & are now as much rap'd
up in thick cloathing as we would see them in Dublin in the Winter
at this time the sun is as hot in the mid day as I have felt it
during the summer the evenings and nights are begining to be cool
yet I do not find them so; a heavy dew falls when the sun is down
which drive the Inhabitants under cover of their Houses they avoid
it [unclear]more[/unclear] than we would rain, consequently few but Irish walk
the streets at night & they are compristed 1/3 of the Inhabitants
27th Since writing the above I have made enquiry & taken the advice of a
few friends here particularly Abm Bell & his wife who are very kind indeed
they came to see us & brought us ready dress'd provisions they pressd us to go oftener
to their house we din'd there twice the result of their advice [insertion]was[/insertion] not to proceed
with my family to the west so late in the year and so small a means
the whole of which they say would be expended in the journey there, mortifying
as this intelligence was to my inclinations and plans I found it the
most prudent plan to submit. I then concluded to proceed myself [deletion]but[/deletion] [insertion]and[/insertion]

leave my family here to promise [unclear]employ[/unclear] at their [unclear][/unclear] but on more
mature deliberation Margarets being an invalid Bettys delicate health I have
concluded to stay by them this winter & to get a few Cows that concluded on
I have been in search for several days of a place to suit me but it is a
difficult matter to get a House [unclear][/unclear] Wright made me an offer of part
of his if I could not do better which I accepted of last evening, it is a Shop
(or Store as they are call'd here) two rooms a celler and a Garrett or loft, with
a shed in the yard for Cows which I have to cover myself he is a Brewer
therefore I have the Grains at home there are two distillerys at hand &
I can have his horse to draw the wash, by paying him a proportion for
his keep in the Store and intend setting Potatoes flouer Butter Bread Milk
Soap & Candles, &c and ready made needle work or to take in work - for
this place I am to pay 100 dollars until the 1st 5 mo next a dollar
is 8/s here, Milk is 8d per Dt. 4d Irish and not good, Beef 6d to 8d Mutton the
same Pork 1/- [unclear][/unclear] dip'd Candles 17 per [unclear][/unclear] 20d N York money, I hear
 Chandling is a [deletion]good[/deletion] [insertion]profitably[/insertion] Business here [deletion]they are[/deletion] [insertion]Chandlers are[/insertion] [unclear]snug[/unclear] I ha[unclear][/unclear]
been more than 2 miles in the Country it is sandy soil I h[unclear][/unclear]
[unclear][/unclear] they say it is better as we advance I saw wheat [unclear][/unclear]
they were cutting green - I made out Sam B. he has chang'd his lodging
since I came here [unclear][/unclear] is 70 Miles from hence and the Delaware in [unclear]unpleasant[/unclear]
at 8 drs per week I wish I could say the same of his father - it is our
 intention to save what we can & early in the spring I purpose proceeding
to the mast. Having my Family here until I get a place ready
for them I have not for one [unclear][/unclear] regrated leaving Ireland and
I can say the same for the thinking part of my family I have met
some here who are preparing to return they brought out goods
and expected to make handsomely but were disappointed for al[unclear][/unclear]
but all cloathing is as reasonable here as in Dublin making up
is higher - I have written to my Bro in law 2nd [unclear]Allsmont[/unclear] and Saml Haughton
should they leave any correspondance for me to send it to thee & thou will
forward it [unclear][/unclear] tho [unclear][/unclear] at all events I would like to have a letter
from thee as early as may be that I may regulate my following plans towards the
accomplishment of my original plan I find in general they are as I [unclear][/unclear]
the Western country as we are in Ireland & tho I have heard [unclear][/unclear] to take a farm in
this quarter up the [unclear]Hudson[/unclear] river where they say there are many good tracks yet
I am not partial to it not notwithstanding this is a good market for trading but the
[unclear][/unclear] of the winters here & the hot summers there being no spring as they say
are strong reasons in my mind to proceed [unclear]more west[/unclear] It is my intention to work
to [unclear]Berkwich[/unclear] direct & expect a reply before [unclear][/unclear] of the late Ind. Nickolson
& seen him & is expected every day on his return he has not [unclear][/unclear]
in favourable account of him in his settlement in his letters to his Sister & mother
who are here at A. Bells - I leave [unclear][/unclear] love to C Allen & finally also to [unclear][/unclear]
S.B. says he wrote to the latter - Margarets [unclear]loss so[/unclear] but it will be soon
[unclear][/unclear] before she [insertion]can[/insertion] get about Betty & the children [unclear][/unclear] love to thee
Margaret & thy family I remain thy affecte Cousin
