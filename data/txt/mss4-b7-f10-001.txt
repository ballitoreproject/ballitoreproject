Mrs. Leadbeater
You are welcome to transcribe
those lines of my friend — It gratifies me that
you like them.
The very good opinion you form
[James McConnachy]
of J.McC., makes the heart of his friend expand
with grateful pleasure. The amicability
of [insertion]his[/insertion] disposition is nothing less, than what
your words express. He is a young man
of pure morals; and has a heart, innocent,
warm, and affectionate.
My thing I have written, is
only the wretched — futile attempt of a pot
taster. You will have the goodness,
therefore, should any other eye happen
to see them, to conceal the writer's name
J Reedly
your's truly
