9th.. Went 22 miles to Hawick, where S:H had another publick
meeting, in which she was again largely concerned, S:T, & S:B
also shared the labour. - I expect it was a more satisfactory
meeting than the last: they are exceedingly spending to [underline]my[/underline]
spirits. 10th To Kelso, 21 miles, went to S:H's 6 O'clock meeting: the
people in general in a very unsettled state, S:T spoke early in the
meeting, - they still seeming to have no stay for their minds, Sally
Birkbeck reasoned very prettily with them on the subject:- after
which, & after sore conflict of mind on my own account, I thought
I did feel, - but may shamefully acknowledge my unwilliness
which was great, so I kept struggling with it till the time
was past: - the meeting continued very restless & uncomfortable,
altho' S:H, & S:T both ministered to them. We lodged at
Margaret Anderson's, (a P-T) a widow, & her two daughters
