My dear E - I would be much obliged if thou'd
send me my precious profiles which I forgot
last night I knew there was some thing
forgotten I think Abby would bring them safely
they are under the toilet cover in the room
over the parlour my packets are in one
of the drawers in the press she wd
bring them - also I am very troublesome
I hope the leases will soon
be ready for signing now thy SB
