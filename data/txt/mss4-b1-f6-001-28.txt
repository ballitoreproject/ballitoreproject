a detachment on board his Majesty's fleet, we cannot get him to fight us,
so you see I shall be both a soldier & a sailor if the war continues & I live.
I am just returned off from a five weeks cruise in his Majesty's ship the
St. Albans, we were off Guadalope, Dominica, Martinico, Deseada, & to
Windward of Barbadoes, to intercept a convoy of provisions from Bourdeaux
to Martinico, but were not fortunate enough to meet with them,
if we had I should have made my fortune by prize-money.
The only strange news I can inform you of is that Ned Miles, that
was your father's former usher, lives in Arch-street Philadelphia, he keeps
a miserable shop of spirits & some few groceries; I had lodgings quite
close to him the whole winter, but never spoke to him, or made myself
known to him, although I am sure he knew me, for he used to look
very attentively at me whenever I pass'd [insertion]him[/insertion] by, but I never took notice of
him, nor do I think he is worth it; he seems to lead a most abominable
life. I would have wrote to your father by this packet, but
she was under way, & nothing could stop her. I sat down to write to
you both, I began your's first, would have wrote the other if I had
time, but as it would take me more time to write to your father than to
you, shall defer it to another opportunity. Be kind enough to hide all
the nonsense of my letter, I imagine myself sitting in your parlour, so
what you get from me is just as if I was speaking to you, nothing
studied you may be assured by your very sincere friend,
& very humble servant
