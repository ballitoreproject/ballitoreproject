Ballitore 12th.. of 12th.. month 1820.
My dear Elizabeth
I am very much obliged to thee for
the little book thee sent me, I think it is a very pretty
one. My sister Sally has not been well this month
she did not come to school: she is very much obliged
to thee for the book thee sent her. I am glad
to hear thee will soon come home. Aunt Mary
& Anne have consented to let me go home for a
few days, as the Mistress is going to Dublin
to see her friends. I think thy flowers are
growing very well. I have got two geraniums
one of them is just going to blow.
My two Aunts join me in dear love to thee.
I remain thy affecate.. M A Haughton
