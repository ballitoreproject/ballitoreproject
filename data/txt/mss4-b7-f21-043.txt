I have a promise dear Friend, of
getting my letter frank'd to you, -
the want of which, has been the
chief cause of my silence, - I thank
you for your kind letter, & for the justice
you do me, in believing me incapable
of forgetting all the kind attentions
I received during my abode at
Ballitore, - whilst memory remains,
I shall think of [deletion]it[/deletion][insertion]them[/insertion] [insertion]them[/insertion] with grateful
pleasure - I am very glad to hear
all my Friends are comfortably circumstanced,
& as well as encreasing
years.

will admit of; it is time for us
old Folks to be moving off the stage,
& leaving room for young ones to act
their part - I am of the number of
those, who think our best Times
are gone with our good old King.
I perfectly agree with you as to the
probable consequences of the Royal
visit to Ireland; I will enclose you
a sort of Parody of the [underline]first[/underline] Gracious
Speech, & as you I believe are better
employd than in studying Newspapers
(on which we English dwell with
singular delight) I will mark the
Royal Words with emphasis -
I have never met with Mr Crabbe,
I believe he is my Countryman; there
is much of Nature (but not beautiful
nature) in his Poetry; & the reader
tires in dwelling so much on the Miseries
on Life, & rather wishes the Poet to
beguils some of its realities - Some
of my Friends are acquainted with Crabbe
& are not particularly pleased with
his conversation - I have been so
accustom'd to hear Priscilla Gurney
spoken of with delight, that I always
wish'd for her acquaintance, & was therefore
gratified by your lines, so justly
descriptive of her Person & Mind -
I was given to expect a visit from
that "Angel of Mercy Elizabeth Fry"

& was much disappointed at her being
prevented from giving me that pleasure.
Benevolence is the characteristic of
your Society! & only that ye are too Good
to be proud, ye might exult over all
other Sects, - I say this in perfect [underline]sincerity,[/underline]
without meaning any Compliment -
Ci- devant Turpy has been engaged in
sad scenes of distress,- - her Husband &
his horse were thrown down, by a Gig being
driven against them; the man was taken
up speechless, in which state he continued
3 days & then died - before his affairs were
settled, his Son (who lived under the same
roof) was seized with Pluerisy & died, - so
that a raveled business remains to be
settled - Turpy I expect is certain of enjoying
her jointure, which is £90 [unclear][/unclear]., & the power
of bequeathing £900 by Will - She begs her duty
to you & Love to the Doyles -
