Circular Road Dublin June 3d. 1817.
To Mrs. Leadbeater
Madam,
Your Letter to our worthy Vice
President, Mrs. P. La Touche, forwarded from hence, has
been returned by her, for my perusal; with a request
That I would attend to the subject of it - I am sorry
that, in consequence of the very heavy proportion
of little children at present on the Establishment,
we are not able to spare such a girl as would suit
your purpose - I therefore beg to know if it would
be agreeable, & convenient to you, to have one, 4 or 6,
months hence, if we should, at that time, have one
answering the description contain'd in your letter?
Mrs. P. La Touche is particularly desirous that [underline]your[/underline]
wishes should be gratified.
Any communication address'd to me will be duly
attended to by, Madam, yrs. respectfully
Harriett Howell - Superintendent of the Orphan House
