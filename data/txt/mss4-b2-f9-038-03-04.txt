My dear Cousin,
	+++ & her brother do not hit it together right, though they meet visit & speak. This difference, hardness, shyness, where it gets in & makes a lodg^e^ment, effectually drives out all that is good  People may be moral in their lives, plain in their appearance, orthodox in their opinions, & even active in religious society; yet if this charity, this pure love of God & Man, which is of Divine original, be wanting, what are they? Not Christians I fear in reality  At least some have not so learned Christ. My beloved friend, keep thou much alone, & unconnected in fellowship of spirit with any, except such as thy spirit is drawn near to in the deeps of humbling baptism. This wait for often: be this thy home; where there wilt find Charity to begin, & to diffuse itself in thy mind, & spread towards the houshold [sic] of faith, & mankind in general. In this state thou wilt see what is thy duty, & be fitted for the performance of it. Make no more vain excuses, nor be reasoning ^as^ with flesh & blood - The Lord, whom I trust, my dear cousin, we would wish to serve, is gracious indeed & merciful, & long suffering, yet we may weary him as it were with our reluctances & disobedience, as he complained of his people formerly, Thou hast not brought me the small cattle of thy burnt offerings, neither hast thou honoured me with thy sacrifices. Even the small cattle he does not despise at the hand of his own poor: they offer according to their little ability, & therein they rejoice, & as they continue faithful will witness an increase of their joy. Happy indeed, above all people are the Lords servants: he has himself pronounced & discriminated their happiness, in contrariety to others, Behold my servants shall eat, but ye shall be hungry; behold my servants shall drink, but ye shall be thirsty; behold, my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be ashamed: behold, my servants shall sign sing in joy of heart, but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart, & shall howl for vexation of spirit. This subject has quite unexpectedly turned up I will leave it, & make no apology to so near & dear a friend.
	Thy detail of the latter end of our dear child, & of thy support at the most needful time, as also the communications which thy sister gave us on the subject were very affecting: not less so to many others would be the account of the sudden removal of thy friend & neighbour from her numerous charge. We can truly say we are sorry sorrow for thy loss, & abstractedly from our tender friendship for thee, & long connexion with thee, we greatly regret this dispensation of Infinite Wisdom, on account of our own very affectionate feelings, hopes & prospects. But it is finished: And ^all^ no doubt all is well. +++
						I am, my dear Cousin, thy truly affectionate friend
