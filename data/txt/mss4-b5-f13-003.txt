London 11th, 1790.
My Dear Friend
Tho I have now but little time to write in, I am
rememberance tho, small; please to give my love particularly to thy father &
Mother & tell them I remember their kindness & brotherly love to two poor
little sisters in the course of their Pilgrimage in your country & trust it
will not soon be forgoten by us, wilt thou please also to give my love to thee
other friends of your meeting, & whom opportunity offers remember me also to
thy Sister Grub, Sarah of the Mills & Robert & Mary Dudley to all of whom
I felt much nearness & brotherly love.
Give thee these gestures to thy Father
who I think I love as a Father & desire a small share at least of his love
& do desire to be remembered by you all when it fares well with you. Tho I am
in a city where there are many of the people call,d Quakers, yet there are to few
who are truely what the name imparts, But yet there is a living remnant pressured
who are desirous to worship the lord with fear & to rejoice with trembling who are [unclear]judgeworthy[/unclear]
bowed down together in their assemblies on account of their own weakness & poverty
& the many errors of the People, & the hardness of the labor to get down through
all to the living spring & draw at times a little water for the congregation which
through the great condecention of our heavenly Father is at favored seasons permitted
whereby we are a little encouraged to persevere. May we all my dear to
hold on our way through all opposition & become of that member who overcome
& who will have admittance to the Free of live which stands in the midst of the
Paradise of God. —
