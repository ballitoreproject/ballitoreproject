My dear Cousin,

	+++++ Though troubles of one sort or other impend, yet if our minds are fortified by Grace to bear them, it is all we may expect, for in this world we must have trouble: in our union & communion with Christ is only true peace. It is to be remarked that the three children were not exempted from being cast into the fiery furnace, nor Daniel into the den of lions. Almighty Power permitted them to undergo this trial of their faith (said to be more precious than gold) but he effectually supported them in it. In the course of my late observation & contemplation, looking round about my friends, I have thought it remarkable that many of them seemed to me to be, one way or other, under the hand of affliction, as well as myself. No doubt it is the chastisement of a father, bringing forward his children & changing them ^as^ from glory to glory by these refining dispensations. I am also, I think clear in this matter that this great Creator & Father, this Majesty on high, has long designed, & designeth good things to thee & thine thy house. I believe he means to make thee & thy dear Consort partakers of the sufferings & tribulations which attend the warfare of this day, & by shaking the rod of affliction over you to preserve you more & more in a state of dependence upon him, & in filial fear & obedience to his Will. Kiss this rod, my dear friends, welcome it as a salutary preparative, & bow in all your faculties to the hand that mercifully omits for your good. As ye submit in passive resignation, ye will find this skilful hand will hurt nothing that [word crossed out] is right & sound about you, it will purge away the corruptions of fallen nature [pencil page number] 153 & cut off the proud flesh, but the happy consequences of the plenary operation will be spiritual health, strength & soundness. Ye know very well what a declension is come in amongst us; ye see the ravages & depredations which an enemy to God & man has made in our vineyard. Ye are not insensible of the instability of some who have been called & visited, who not being faithful, & wisely answering the call, are hinderers rather than helpers. O may ye therefore part with all that is demanded; sell All, & ye will get infinitely more than the value of it, & give to the poor, the poor Church, which is greatly impoverished, [word crossed out] little sustenance to live upon, & much naked & bare of those gifts & graces of the Spirit with which she was wont to be clothed & adorned. Devote yourselves to its service, as obedient children & diligent, faithful servants: so will ye have solid satisfaction ^peace & comfort^ here, & ensure a treasure in heaven to all eternity, when these few, fleeting days of trouble & probation will have an end. +++ My father is now & then pretty cheery, again attacked with fits of his disorder, confined at present mostly to his chamber. +++

		thy affectionate friend & kinsman
