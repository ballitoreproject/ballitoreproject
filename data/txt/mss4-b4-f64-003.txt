Second-day I have been thinking my dear Aunt whether a letter
from me would be acceptable and have concluded to try by seeing
if thou wilt answer this, I have not much to say but little as it is
I will say it, that bids me (in one of thy letters) to let artlessness and love
be the [underline]prominent features[/underline] of my letters, now it is my love for thee that
induces me to write this time as I hope soon to hear from or see thee.
Ever since my Aunt and Liddy went I have been at the Mill untill
lastnight when I came home to sleep with Hannah Wilson.
I was sorry to leave my old Bedfellow Betsy for a new one but my
mother would not let me stay. John & Agnes [unclear]Choity[/unclear] & my fathers &
mother dined at the Mill yesterday, John & Jane Thomas, Hannah Boake
& Hannah Wilson took tea there, "not to mention" the above who
John [insertion]Clunes [insertion] did not go home 'till near ten o'clock. When does thou intend coming
home? - How is Mary Naughton of Tullow-Street? thou [insertion]sees[/insertion] I am asking thee
questions hoping to have them answered. I suppose my uncle Chandlee
is much the same way, I think it is very odd that he does not recover, he
would be a great loss if he should be taken from his family. [unclear][/unclear]
How is thy stomach now, is it easier than when thou wert here?
My mother has made another verse to Agnes Christy about the Sylphs
[insertion]that ought to be[/insertion] watching her when she is asleep and giving her pleasant dreams for
she does be always dreaming of home and her mother and is very
uneasy about her; My mother also wrote a very pretty letter to Ebenezer
which she intends to send in a Frank which is to be got from the Marquis
of Ely who is to be at the Inn too-morrow night. I think I
must conclude with dear love to Liddy & Mary Naughton in which
my mother joins me and accept a large share from thy very
P.S. Excuse bad writing as
I am in haste,
affectionate niece
