1806
About 18 years ago I got a complaint in my throat, which, tho' not attended
with inflamation, [insertion]or much soreness[/insertion] was yet very troublesome & hard to remove, I think it affected
me principally with a fullness & prickly sensation about the uvula & back parts
of the palate of my mouth, [insertion]&[/insertion] I believe it was rather uncommon for the medical people
who were then consulted seemed not to understand it, & its obstinacy baffled all their
prescriptions for a long time, however they generally agreed that it proceeded from a
relaxation of the parts, called by the vulgar the falling of the palate, or the palate of
the mouth being down. & I suppose it was something of that nature, for astringent gargles
seemed of the most use to it, after continuing many months it began gradually to get
better, & I became so accustomed to the sensation that I thought less of it, till at length
it entirely wore off, however I have had frequent returns of it ever since, especially
in the spring & autumn, but in a slighter degree. It is now upwards of a year
since I felt a sharp soreness in one side of my throat towards the root of my
tongue, sometimes attended with that tingling, or prickly sensation across the
back parts of the palate, & sometimes not. it is accompanied by little or no
inflamation, is troublesome in swallowing, particularly my spittle, & is generally
most uneasy towards the night, during the summer & autumn months it grew
much better, so that it was very little trouble to me tho' I felt it more or less
I believe every day, that is the soreness, which seems to be fixed in the one spot.
since this last attack, it [deletion]seems[/deletion] [insertion]appears[/insertion] to obstruct both my voice & breathing, or at
least to increase the difficulty in these respects arising from a previous asthmatic
habit, I believe it [insertion]is[/insertion] situated out of sight, & the medical men whom I consulted
within this last year did not appear to understand much about it. within these
last few weeks it has grown much more uneasy, & all the troublesome symptoms increased.
My dear Mary, In the foregoing account of my wearisome infirmity I have
stated every thing that occurred to me as necessary almost, but I was thinking [deletion]thou[/deletion]
by putting it into thy own words thou could [deletion][/deletion] [insertion]draw it[/insertion] it into a smaller compass, & express
it more clearly, which I leave to thyself, perhaps it might not be amiss too to tell him
& with an uncomfortable dryness, which even the usual saliva did not seem to moisten

my age (46) & that in my younger days I was rather liable to scorbutic complaints,
& [deletion]that[/deletion] [insertion]had[/insertion] about [deletion]10 or[/deletion] 12 years ago [deletion]I had[/deletion] an attack of that nature which was compleatly
removed by the use of mercury. Thou might mention also that the soreness
I complain of does not feel as if the skin was broke, but like something [insertion]formed[/insertion] under the
skin. If thou thinks it would [insertion]be[/insertion] proper to inclose a fee with this statement let me
know & I will send it thee, thine affectionately AH

Dear Mary, Having a little spark of [underline]decent[/underline] pride it felt unpleasant
me to ask the Doctors opinion without making such recompense as I well
[unclear]could[/unclear], therefore concluded to send thee a guinea to inclose him, & sent Bessy
[unclear]out[/unclear] to get it for that purpose, [insertion]this morning[/insertion] but J Thomas who is my banker was from
me, so I did not get it. but will send it thee time enought for the post I
tend, I think the little hint about my circumstances would not be amiss,
take thy freedom herein as I am sure it is meant, very kindly,

thy A H
