(a pretty large Fair is held here to day.)

	Well, my dear cousin Debby, I have been just again perusing the last letter which I received from thee, & am excited by the pleasure which it affords me to put thee again in my debt. Our letters are not like the fine linen made in your part of the country, thumped, rubbed, & artificially managed so as to make it fine & nice -- no matter how soon it wears out: But they are of simple, honest, homespun materials, no extraordinary pains taken in the fabric & texture -- coarsish perhaps our correspondence, but I hope it will last as long as ourselves -- It was unpleasant not to see more of your family-connexions at our last solemnity in Dublin -- I have no doubt but that the will was not wanting -- but circumstances must be submitted to -- Best Wisdom dwells with prudence -- however; as we are surrounded on all sides with dangers, we should keep a guard on all sides -- As there may be a being righteous over much, so there may be a being prudent over much -- I wish us to be so modelled by divine hand, that we may be in an acceptable state, & preserved in it -- If thou will get prepared & fitted in every respect to attend the next Yearly-meeting of women-friends in London, perhaps it may atone for a multitude of past accumulated omissions -- The younger women cannot go -- they want stability, weight & experience -- & if they have these in a proportion beyond their years -- if true Wisdom be their grey hairs -- yet they are bearing children, nursing, &c. -- or if they have none of these, they have husbands -- they are married -- they cannot -- perhaps will not be suffered to come. Remember, I bespeak thee in time for this service -- Set now a good example -- increasing years & infirmities will bring increasing impediments -- use strength & have strength -- use liberty & have liberty -- there is that giveth & yet increaseth -- remember who it is that loveth a cheerful giver. I had a severe cold in Dublin -- indeed I brought it with me to & from the city; but I am now (thank Providence) in usual health -- My wife has been ailing a good deal -- she thinks it is the Rheumatism, which affects her neck & shoulders -- but she is (through favour) also better, & her spirits at present pretty good -- Sally has been ill with her jaw & teeth -- she put her head into the hands of a dentist in Dublin, yet has been complaining since her return -- however seems now pretty well -- Molly remained behind us in Dublin, with her old Linguist, Angier, who happened to be on this side the water, & offered his further service to her -- she is like many people in the world; if she gets any good or profit, she is apt to fall away again, & lose it for want of care & practice -- We expect her home to morrow along with her friend Molly Bewley, who is to make some stay with us -- I suppose thou hears from thy sister Abby -- she does not seem to be in confirmed health -- every now & then complaining with one indisposition or other -- I think she wants some skilful advice -- Late account of thy mother & relations at Violet-bank continued favourable -- We had the pleasure of Peggy Grubbs company in Dublin -- she & her husband intended to have paid a visit in Athy, but were prevented. I hope Peggy is growing in capacity for service -- In private opportunities, family-visits, meetings of discipline & conference she often breaks out in a beautiful, lively manner; but I have not heard of her yet speaking in publick meetings of worship -- she looked very well, & was very cheerful, like an obedient servant & dutiful child, who did her duty, & enjoyed peace -- In a letter which her mother here received lately from her she says, I received thy word of encouragement with gratitude, & my desires are for preservation from the power of all evil, that I may not be deceived by the grand Adversary ^deceiver^ in any of his transformations, neither let in a cowardly spirit, that is too saving of Self & its reputation. I am sensible I am surrounded with infirmities, & had need be found watching; which watch I believe our Enemy endeavours diligently to break in upon, & prevent our keeping up -- but as we not only are concerned to watch, but also to get to the Tower, we may discover his approaches, & elude his malicious designs. She was favoured with her worthy husband to get well home & found the family finely -- She was in the more haste, as she wanted to attend their monthly meeting, where her sister Becky presented her intentions of marriage with Jo Strangman 12th instant. I hope this intended union will be a happy one -- the young couple seem well-minded & promising -- What dost think of Nancy Shannon opening a boarding-school for young lasses? Is there any encouragement for her in your province? She has such a scheme in contemplation -- but I know not whether it will take effect, nor where she concludes to settle -- I understand our dear friend Samuel Neale has not been so well lately, as he was some time ago -- that another tumour has appeared on his hip, or somewhere -- I trust thy amiable daughter-in-law has continued to recruit, as we hear nothing to the contrary: I hope in a little time when she gathers strength & takes courage & confidence, she will set thee free from domestick cares -- I think its high time for cousin Peggy Pike to be weaned from Stramore, & where-ever she is settled with her husband, to think herself at home, & in her centre -- Give all our dear love to them, to Johny Christy & his wife, James of Lurgan & his wife, when thou hast opportunity -- please be particular when thou writes (& soon) how ye all are in health, & how Molly MccLoughlins grandchild thrives -- Tell her from me not to be too full of care about it, to endeavour to be loosened a little, & keep in the moderation -- Peggy Grubb is grown pretty big -- Our dear Lydia has but a few weeks to reckon -- she is sometimes rather poorly -- but in general as well as may be expected -- the children finely -- the eldest seven years old -- the youngest (George) 15 months old, goes alone [obscured by seal] some time -- Ebenezer, who was so long ailing, grown a fine, stout, hearty child -- I hear Do[obscured by seal] Knowles (husband of Molly Knowles) died lately of a fever in London -- & that James Freeman brother of Patience Chester is imprisoned in Holland, I suppose for debt. Thou heard doubtless of the decease of Debby Haughton -- the surviving children of that house keep together, have pretty business in the shop, the eldest brother does something at the wool-combing, & I hope the poor things will get a livelihood -- the girls are well-minded. Anna Taverner is with them still -- I know not but they are blest for her sake -- She is much in the same way that she has long been -- no sign of ending, or mending -- confined almost constantly to her bed -- visited I believe often & inwardly supported by a divine life. She has a sufficiency for her outward maintenance -- We are just on the eve of our province-meeting at Castledermot, expect some company in consequence to morrow night. We have lately held our monthly meeting of discipline there, & are to hold our next there also -- Ben Whittons wife has had twin-sons -- is rearing them both with the spoon -- Old age is coming fast upon Jonathan & Phebe Carleton -- John brave & stout -- revived with getting his share (at last) of Cousin Sams legacy -- Inclosed is extract of a letter which I had in 5 days from London -- perhaps the intelligence may not be new to thee now -- All our very dear love attends you all, & our best wishes are for every generation of you. My dear friend & cousin, farewell.	
	Richard Shackleton
