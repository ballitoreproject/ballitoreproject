My Dear Mary,
We were all glad to hear of thy
Recovery, and partook wth you in our [underline]measure[/underline]
in the shocking catastrophe of poor
Daly - what lengths of depravity & barbarity
is human nature prone to - when the passions
are suffered to range at large - and why
such passions & depravity are suffered to
overwhelm a large portion of the human
race, is a problem & mystery - wch
(I believe) can never be solved by man
whilst in this stage of existence. God only
wise has reserved this knowledge to himself
we are told of a serpent a Satan or a Devil
going about as a roaring lion & of his
having had a war in heaven & these are
deep mysteries indeed, & a [unclear][/unclear] inexplicable
to our finite understandings
yet from this ray of the Divinity in
man - may we not venture to conclude
that the grand evil lies in our own
corrupt breasts - but poor mankind 
Mary Leadbeater
Ballitore

has been ever ready to excuse himself
& [insertion]to[/insertion] throw the blame of his transgressions
of the Divine Law written in the heart
upon some evil agent - it is a common
saying among the common people when
[insertion][underline]on their fellows[/underline][/insertion] they commit a [insertion]great[/insertion] fault that the Devil
bewitched them - they have taken up
this excuse (I expect) from the story of Eve
eating the apple from a similar temptation
if the saddle was fixed on the right horse
I imagine all our omissions & commissions
originate in our own corrupt inclinations
or the volition of our own wills or free agency
how we are drawn away & enticed by
own [deletion]own[/deletion] hearts lusts & instead of being
willing to acknowledge our guile we [unclear][/unclear]
the blame on a Diabolical agency & strive
very little to amend our ways - while we
have this roaring lion to bear the burden
& so poor man has gone on for thousands
of years & his moral conduct very little
improved - I have wandered from my
subject very unexpectedly - when I began
I only intended to propose my ideas respecting
the expediency of endeavouring to raise
a little money for the distressed widow
to help to lighten in a small degree
her grievous affliction & I have already
applied to a few feeling minds & shd
like to hear has any thing of this
kind occurred to your neighbourhood
the bearer waits I must Conclude
thy afft frd
