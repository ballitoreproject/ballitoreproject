My dear E — I thought Lucy would be ready
to go to Ballitore on 7th day but [insertion]have[/insertion] heard since
that she is not ready so I cannot say
the day you may expect her, but intend
letting you know before hand, May
is much better & at the Glen, Edw had
a letter from Jas. Richardson about one boy
so that thy commission [underline] sped [/underline], has
Thos Glazebrook one? or would it be desirable
to have one of his sons? younger
than Jas — Jas would not answer
this thou could consider of thyself —
Jas Fisher hurries away giving us
too little of his company he [unclear]lodged[/unclear]
with aunt Jane at J Jodhunter's
dont thou think my mother could come
or that her health would be benefit[deletion]t[/deletion]ed
by coming I do not like to [unclear]press[/unclear] her lest
- either she or my father might suffer
by it & still a little relaxation from
writing might be of use I'm afraid
her task is too laborious —
I would be obliged to thee to get me some
eggs some good lard & a stone of R TY L's sent

flour & to make [unclear]enquiry[/unclear] about feathers
as I want to make up a bed a midle
sized one if thou cannot get the lard
easily do not mind it — I wish you would
pack a firkin of butter for me that would
keep surely you might aswell send
it here as to Carlow I'm afraid
I am very troublesome but this is no
new discovery — with dear love to all
thy SB
E. Leadbeater
how do inferior feathers sell?
