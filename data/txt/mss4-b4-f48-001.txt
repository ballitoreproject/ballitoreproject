Ballitore: 17/3 month 1803
My dear Betsy,
It is not long since I received thy very acceptable letter, &
I obey the presen impulse by replying, or attempting to reply just
now. I am much pleased whenever I think of the fair prospect of happiness
opened to our dear Jane,
"An elegant sufficiency, content,
Retirement,* quiet, friendship, books
Ease & alternate labour, useful life,
Progressive virtue, & approving heaven."
She can never be happier than I wish her to be, & her dear Cory, with
whom I wish I was better acquainted, nor any of you round the happy
fireside, or gracing the apartments abut even which thou interests me,
That active, industrious education for which Jane is obliged to her excellent,
amiable mother, joined to her own good sense, will make her shine in the
domestick sphere, as well as in those called higher, but not more conducive
to comfort. I hope thou excused me to her for not going to see her when here,
or if not that thou wilt do so. I thought she would stay longer, & the children
were very poorly. I expect your circle of acquaintance is a pleasant one.
I like Wm. Alexander's house, he is kind, & enhanced to me as an [underline]old acquaintance[/underline]
Betty some degrees higher in the scale of intellect & entertainment. Sasha
Thacker looks like a clever man, I do not know him, Betty is certainly a clever
woman, easy & affable, & once the friend of my ever lamented Betty & Sally
Houghton, the remembrance of whom, the dear playmates of infancy, prevents
me from seeing distinctly what I write- I take it as a compliment to be told
[Haughton]
[Fowler]
fill up this
blank, as [underline]rural[/underline]
will not do at present.

I resemble thee, I hope thou does the same, [underline]as the junior is bound to do[/underline]
but believing the resemblance [underline]does exist[/underline] I write to thee just as I think. But
now I think it is time to go to meeting, to which I mean to go, acknowledging that
I go in the form, but hoping I do no wrong, as I feel firmly attached to the society
in which I was born & to its excellent rules, & hope ever to continue a member
of it, at the same time feeling myself far behind thou who have thought
it right to withdraw, & desire that if such a sacrifice should be required
of me I may be enabled to make it in the same spirit as many of those
have done. I am returned from meeting & from seeing dear Anna, & visiting
In the first time the little Lyceum in the Grove, as the door of wch. I pound to
delight my ears with the [underline]old hum[/underline], how like the institution & the institutors is
the situation, sequestered, modest & performing more than promise! Comments of the
late alarm at the Cottage were introduced, scarce any but Susan believe it the attack of a
drunken man. Mary Stephens shewed great presence of mind, & Providence surely protected
them! I suppose thou heard that Garrett Lee now lodges there, Sarah Meddlicott I hear wished
for him, but I Susan was beforehand in securing the Champion, whom we may now call
"Defender of the Fair," a title as just, honourable & intelligble as that borne by his old Master
Geo: 3d. Garrett, tho' he looks as he does, is a man of courage. I am sorry you have not
the love letters in your edition of Burns, as they might, in process of time, be good
patterns for Ebenezer. Do ask, but not very earnestly, who is the most approved printer
in Dublin, that if at any time a second fit of publishing should come athwart me,
& the [insertion]fear[/insertion] terror of the Reviewers not be before my eyes, I might come forth on neat
paper & a fair type, & look gentuler than I have hitherto done. Also enquire
about Eliz: Hamilton if thou meets Belfast people. Also get me for love or money
a few grains of Gourd-seed with directions how to manage that dear [deletion]oldish[/deletion] plant
of [underline]oldish times[/underline] wch. used to twine up the trees in the Retreat orchard. Also get me
a piece of fair window glass 7 inch: by 5 1/2 & as much good black mode as will
make me a bonnet (the wch. I expect thou will make). For all which I will be much

obliged. I had no intention of troubling thee with commissions when I began, but
as my thoughts expanded, the little conveniences appertaining to self came before the
view of my mind, & so I present them to the view of thine. I am sorry I cannot gratify our
mutual taste by describing myself as writing at the little round table, where I often
write quietly, but I have been upstairs & down stairs & in three corners of the parlour,
while at this. My visit to Carlow was very pleasant, & I believe all our party found
it so. Deborah was struck with the magnificence of Tirnolin, Castledermot excited
still more lively ideas, but Carlow - Carlow [insertion]was[/insertion] the ne plus ultra, yet not quite that,
In Deborah thinks that Dublin [underline]may [/underline]exceed it. Our walk to Clogrennan was
delightful, of a summer's evening or an Autumnal afternoon it must be enchanting!
When the elegant structure of Belmont on the left, & the Mountain before us
opened on the view, I could scarce believe then that I had any thing superior to see.
But I had no incredulity on that [deletion]hand [/deletion][insertion]head[/insertion] when we stopped to take in the view
Castle, the river, & the Mansion simply magnificent, whose yellow walls [unclear]forwith [/unclear]
such a contrast to the dark green of the woody mountain. We did not walk
about the grounds [insertion]or up the Mountain[/insertion], but the old gardener, who recognized Den would, [underline]nolens volens[/underline],
have us into the Green house, & wanted us to proceed farther into the house, but the
family being at home we resisted, although he told us Col: Rochford would be [underline]proud [/underline]
to let us see his place (so would I if it was mine). Thou hast heard of the excess
of Deborah's admiration, her delight, & the thought of her new stock of ideas formed
no inconsiderable part of ours. Thou remembers the Stewards cottage, thou must
remember it if thou saw it, for it was a more interesting object, because more
within our own sphere, than the great house. The Hypericum Irutix (I think it
is) trained over the front [insertion]of the[/insertion] house,& enlivening winter with its red berries, the
convenient garden with 19 stocks of Bees, some in boxes, but above all the
fountain bubbling up opposite the house surrounded with grass plots & verbenas,
having a clear stream across the Court, & turning an overshot Mill, all delighted
us more than I can tell thee, for nothing delights like the pleasure of simplicity.

The variety in Cadow was very Pleasant. [unclear]Honest[/unclear] Saml Haughton [underline]rather fririe[/underline] & honest
Wilson [underline]rather bitter[/underline], but neither have harm in their hearts, & could they keep quiet I
think they & those about them would be happier. We were very happy with them all. But
I was ready to cry when I thought it would be the last time I should see dar Ben in Cadou.
Ben, whom since he could stand under this little round table, at wch. by another revolution I am
again seated, was a dear, good little fellow, & whose candour, intelligence, genius, tacte & honest
hearty goodnature makes us dubious which most to love or admire him. I believe "some
natural tears he will drop" on leaving his native place, but when he gets amid the sweet
society of Upper-Bridge street he will "wipe them soon".
Nurse Lennon desires her love to thee, would be glad if thou could hear of her
husband which if any enquiry was made at BWells at Paradise-row thou could
be like to do, for Bill went to Dublin & the pon woman having heard of a press
is fearful on his account. Wm desires his love afftly to thee. I sent a letter from
Sally for thee to M Chambers last night. What is become of Jo: Greenwood? I never
hear of him of late. Wert thou at [unclear]Haerlem[/unclear]? Enquire did Nancy Bewley
got a letter which I sent by Jos Mandies. Does Martha draw? The view of [unclear]Clozgrennan[/unclear]
would be a fine subject. My love to all enquiring friends
Wm would be obliged if those could obtain information for him
whether Jos Pim got his letter sent by same hand.
Thine dearly MLeadbeater
