        From the same to the same

My dear James,
        +++ For my part I see so little of a nobly giving up, of a total surrender, that I seem to grow dull & phlegmatick. There is not even in the visited children the Going forward that I want. Something retards their entering into the full possession of their lots in the service of the day: they hear of Giants in the land - a lion is in the way: so they are afraid to advance according to the Divine Call: or they are allured by the baits of ease and affluence to take up a rest by the way, to make a partial dedication, and to reserve the best (the chief of their time & talents) for their own gratification & [word crossed out] temporal emolument. My dear James, this will never do: I am persuaded thou hast not so learned Christ: but thou finds it to be thy incumbent duty to follow on to know the Lord in his further discoveries & requirings. Thou wearest a concerned mind when thou sees' the testimony of Truth trampled upon by the professors of it: & thy peace is interested in the upholding of the same. Hereby, & by watching & waiting for the coming of our Lord, a growth is experienced, both in root and branch, in leaves and fruit. ++
        Thou asks' about the writings of Locke: I believe all, or most of his epistles ^pieces^ that are published, have their peculiar excellence. It would be well I think to get his paraphrase on the epistles of the apostle Paul.
