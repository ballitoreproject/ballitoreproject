forth in all his splendour and we
spent an hour or two strolling about
[deletion]the [unclear][/unclear][/deletion][deletion]Sl[/deletion] Some of the trees
are the finest I have [deletion]I[/deletion] ever seen
I think, and altogether the place
is very pretty and well kept. There
were numbers of different kind of
water fowl on the lake and plenty
of fine hares darting and racing
about with an air which showed
they were not molested much by
dogs or guns. The drive home
was pleasant too and we reached home
quite safely after such a long and
[underline]dangerous[/underline] journey at about 8 1/2.
30 Friday - James went away this
morning and we feel rather lonely
without his pleasant company -
Thomas Haughton called after tea
bringing some parcel for Polly with
him.
31 Saturday. Not very fine and rather
cold. I took two sketches to day
for Doctor Patton as he asked me to.
