								Ballitore: 29/12 month 1778
+++ The accounts now most recent among us from America are that Friends there have suffered exceedingly in their property - Thomas & Susanna Lightfoot among the rest - that there were 178 friends in prison in Philadelphia, mostly for refusing to bear arms - that two friends, Abraham Carlisle & John Roberts (the latter a rich man, having a large family & of good esteem) were under sentence of death, & confined in the dungeon - that one of them had his legs much hurt, some said cut to the bone by the straitness of the fetters - that application had been made to Congress, & orders given to have them eased: in short that extreme sufferings attended our friends there, information being against them from any envious person that chooses to accuse them. +++
	Thy account of Joseph & James is not as we could wish - yet we will hope that thy next will bring us better news respecting them. I need not caution thee against repining at the dispensations of Infinite Wisdom, nor inform thee that the parting with innocent children is far less grievous than to be wounded to the heart by their misconduct. Experience in affliction, as well as experience of consolation have schooled & disciplined thee; so that thou hast learned to submit to the hand that in mercy chastises the adopted children, & with filial fear to look up in resignation to him who has appointed the rod & decrees the number of the stripes. +++
							thy truly affectionate friend & kinsman
