From the same to the same			

							Ballitore: 14/3 month 1776
My dear Cousin,
	I have just been reading again the last letter which I received from thee: & the perusal of it causes a fresh revival of the sensations accompanying long friendship, a friendship combined among our families by manifold ties of early acquaintance, kindred & affection both natural & spiritual, & strengthened by a participation of mutual satisfactions & sorrows, a friendship begun with the earliest remembrance of some, & which I trust will continue to the latest period of us all. I believe it has a foundation more durable than that of bare outward acquaintance, interest or relation. May we not reverently hope that it is tinctured with something of that which is best of all things, a degree of religious sense! Happy those who in this day of jeopardy & scarcity cherish this precious sense, not lavishing it away in words, but hiding this word of life in their hearts; witnessing it to preserve them from evil, & treasuring it up against the day of trial & calamity, which we may expect repeatedly to experience in this uncertain world.
	It is good, my dear friend, to look & lean towards Almighty help in the conducting our family-affairs; in all our ways to acknowledge him, & he will direct our paths: how beautifully the sweet psalmist of Israel expresses himself, & what encouragement he gives, Because thou hast made the Lord which is my refuge, even the most High, thy habitation, there shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling: for he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways, &c. May this preserving hand, my beloved cousin, be always about thee & thine! There is a spirit predominant amongst us as a people, which wanteth to be great, & seeks exaltation of family & a name in the Earth: this is a ravening & grasping, often disappointed, never satisfied: they are like the young lions, which the Psalmist says lack & suffer hunger; but (he adds) they that seek the Lord shall not want any good thing.
Thine in true affection
