My dear friend,
It would seem ungrateful were
I to send the enclosed without some acknowledgement
of thy kindness in permitting me
to open our dear Jacob's letter to thee - which
afforded us much gratification. - we have
[deletion]had[/deletion] since had letters of a later date, expressive
of their feelings on the removal of dear
Brother Christy & our sweet grandChild -
Mary Bell felt much for the loss of her
dear Father, on both subjects Jacob writes
prettyly. Catherine Gratten has commenced
School keeping & I hope after a while may
do well. at present she has very few
Schollars. she seems an interesting young
Woman. Our united love to thee & thine
in which I remain thy affte. friend
R Harvey
I wrote lately to dear Anna
Taverner - Our dear Mary continues very
delicate -
