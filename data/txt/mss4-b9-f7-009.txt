My dear Elizabeth
I have acknowlege several of your
letters but particularly a packet containing sundry leases
of which I have taken a list. This morning I have
been trying to put the Renewals in a way of being
executed. Ardells say there will be no difficulty in the
way of Lydia's but that with respect to your
intent in the Orchard field, it is entirely at the
option of the Johnsons or Parkers to renew or otherwise.
I called on Plunketts Morris Johnsons son in Law
who promised to [deletion]call on[/deletion] [insertion]see[/insertion] Ardell this day on the
subject. When I hear further I shall inform
[unclear]you[/unclear]. It will be necessary for you to ascertain
him Johnson & Ellen Haughton Service their title
to it. If possible get a copy of Deb Wilson's Will
from them and send it up also a [insertion] correct[/insertion] copy of your
fathers will or else ask Eben if I may depend
on the one he sent me being correct. The renewal
of Lydia's plot of ground will of course have it.
he made to her, I should like to have her
assent to our proceedings in writing. You
best chance with the Johnsons is to appear as
gceccless as possible about the matter. Phenhetr
careless as possible about the matter. Plunkett

for thy appearance here that we might see thee

to revive the judgement on the bond as
soon as you can send it. A new bond
will not be necessary, for whatever part
of it he will pay and receipt can be
given him. he promises to pay a little
at once. The [unclear]pervter[/unclear] has come what it
will produce is yet to be learned. I [unclear][/unclear]

South your directing by which I was to [unclear]find[/unclear]
Mary Mayley. There is no [unclear]Secoh[/unclear] No in
the square, which to have it ought to be
four times its present size. It is no
wonder if your letter was so directed that
she did not answer it. Shall I call on
Mrs English to learn such particulars
as he can give me about E and H. If I find
a receipt to give him he would pay the rent
perhaps also McManus, employ me as
you like & believe me your affectionate
