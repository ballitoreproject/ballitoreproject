My dear Mother,
I esteemed very much so, as I know it is with difficulty thou
canst get time to write, which is sometimes my case, & but
for that should have acknowledged the receipt of thine sooner:
our friends were mostly engaged from us before we came home
7th-day, so that we had but little company, the presentation
was made, & sister Becky but poorly in health, which made
it more trying to her spirits, she is recovering since, but not
quite well yet: our little Margt. has also been ailing with
(to appearance) a heavy cold, & lumps I believe inside her
throat & Glands, is better now, Abram has some complaint
also in his jaw, & Anne a sore on her leg, near the
ancle, occasioned by her scratching a little pimple (the girl
says) which festered, whilst I was from home, Eliza seems
finely, & her eyes continue so: Mary Dudley has been confined
too with a cold & several of her children, it seems to be a
little feverish-rash complaint that is catching, she got out
only to the Women's meeting 2nd day, where she appear'd in
a lively testimony; she reckons to be very near her time of
down lying, & is pretty well considering [underline]her[/underline] situation. The
meeting was rather thinly attended, Joseph Garrat came, but
receiving cold by the great rain its like, was laid up at
Clonmel 24 of 11 mo: 1786
I was favoured with thy kind letter, which
two

two-mile-bridge all first day, 2d day got to meeting, was silent
there, as were all our publick meetings, except that James
[unclear]Hays[/unclear] appeared on 1st day morning in testimony, & in the
evening in suplication; as for my part I thought the
publick meetings very dull that day, a little opportunity
unlooked for at our house with a very small company
afforded me some refreshment, & on second day I thought
the clouds were somewhat-dispersed, & a ray of the enlivening
beams of the Sun of righteousness cheered the inward,
invisible Creation, & caused a little spring to appear.
which was great condescendssion, considering what a luke-warm,
careless, ungrateful people we are, too generally.
I receive thy word of encouragement with gratitude, &
my desires are for preservation from the power of [underline]all[/underline]
Evil, that I may not be deceived by the grand deceiver in
any of his transformations, neither let in a cowardly spirit
that is too saving of Self & its reputation. I am sensible
I am surrounded with informities, & had need be found watching
which watch I believe our Enemy endeavours diligently to
break in upon, & prevent our keeping up, but as we not
only are concerned to watch, but also to get to the Tower,
we may discover his approaches, & elude his malicious
designs. I hope next account from you will convey
the pleasing tidings that thy neck & shoulder are relieved from

from the pain [insertion]my Father's cough removed[/insertion], & sister Sally's jaw better, also that other invalides
are restored to health. I was pleased to hear by Father to Betsy
Pim that poor Betty Wilson is released from her burden, poor
thing! I wish her well in every respect, that if in this World she
has her portion of trouble, perplexity, struggles & anxiety, that
by keeping the uppermost room, clean & empty, a recepticle for
her Lord & Master, in him she may have Peace. He who
visits early, & graciously makes himself [deletion]to[/deletion] known in youthful
days, is not minded to leave us in more advanced age, but
still offers the unerring guidance, protection [insertion]& help[/insertion] of his holy
spirit; [insertion]&[/insertion] if we do not fail on our part, in our known duties,
(manifested within,) will never fail us: but he must be indeed
our Lord & Law giver, & he must also be our Master & director.
I did not hear by any one whether Sally's tooth was drawn in
Dublin or not, is Molly returned? how is she? I wrote a few lines
to our kind friend Elizabeth Pike, but happened to be greatly
interrupted whilst I was writing, which made me more brief
than I liked to be, so that I hesitated about sending it, however did.
I think none of our Cork friends who were at Dublin, attended
our Province meeting here, we are informed dear Samuel Neale
is not so well as some time ago, & that another lump has appeared,
on his hip I think. I am pleased to hear they are pretty well
at Athy, it was irksome to me that I could not see them.
I would be obliged for the direction about cleaning plate with burnt
our Province meeting here, we are informed dear Samuel Neale
hartshorn. I hope they are well at my Brother's. Molly Watson
Anna Penrose & Nancy Watson were at the meeting.
And
all, in which they are joined by your dutiful & affectionate daughter. Margt. Grubb
& now think must conclude with my Husband's, Mother's & Becky's dear love to you
our Province meeting here, we are informed dear Samuel Neale
