Ballitore 16th of 6th month 1792



My beloved Anna,
        Thou art so almost perpetually in my thoughts, that meeting with this convenient opportunity by Robert Grubb I thought I would send thee a line +++ Thou, my beloved friend, art tried with bodily indisposition  May thy mind be preserved in a state of calm resignation, in a will-less dedication and surrender of all thy faculties to the operation & direction of him, whose thou art, and whom thou serves [sic] with thy spirit in the Gospel of his Son, even while thou art confined to the sick chamber. His eye penetrates there, and views thy sequestered situation  thy wakeful [page number] 248 hours of night, and the meditations of thy heart in those most solitary seasons are not him from him  And if it be consistent with his infinite, inscrutable wisdom, he will raise and put forth, and gird and strengthen and furnish to his own praise, the edification of his people, and they own unspeakable present and future peace. +++ James Abell writes me that the Quarterly meeting is to be held in Limerick 14th, 15th, 16th, & 17th days of next month. Dont [sic] thou be uneasy, my precious Anna, about getting there  if it were the will of Providence, he could (as aforetime) strengthen thee for the journey  and if it be not his will, it will ^best^ please him, that thou should be content with his allotment  thou art in his gracious hand, and in the delegated hands of most ^kind,^ sincere and cordial friends^+^, who love thee entirely, and are gratified by the opportunity of manifesting it by their tender care and unremitting good offices. Surely they have, and will have their reward +++ My ever dear Anna, farewell
        Richard Shackleton
