First day 30th of 7th mo 1820. I was prevented sending
the little package tomorrow hope to have an opportunity
the wind is fair from Milford. It has
been a fine day - but looks lowering - & causes
some anxiety - our treasures are all in the
hand of a wise and merciful caretaker- Who
as he is looked unto in faith and humility
will do all for us- - our dear friend Elizabeth
Robson lodged here on 6th night. she was much
favoured in meeting this forenoon- my Mother
dines with her at James Moore's.- I do not feel
equal to sit two meeting yet - tho' my strength
increases- this warm weather tires me - Barclay
is finely & James's hand healed. he is become a
fine stout active boy - thy gift to Sarah &
Barclay is much valued - the former has
met with many very kind friends - her letter written
to her sisters this day week: says "I suppose
my Aunt R.G has given a detail of our [unclear]proceedings[/unclear]
but you shall have some from me also - Elizabeth
Howard kindly took us in her coach on 6th day &
[unclear]procured[/unclear] her Uncle & cousins to go with us to the
[unclear][underline]Mint[/underline][/unclear] - I was much pleased with the little machinery
at work - on our return we passed by the Tower

which I saw for the first time on arriving at
Pauls' yard we met some of the Bradchaw's who
had kindly come to conduct us about the City
our first stop was at Rundell's jewelery
which is worth attention - Many things, in preparation
for the Coronation - the Coronets of
the Duke of Cambridge & Sligo amongst [unclear][/unclear]paning
on we came to A Carltons - it wanted
10 minutes of [deletion]10[/deletion] ones so we loitered in a
shop till I saw the men perform their
quarterly operations - going on we come
to Temple bar by Somerset house till
we came to Exeter change - [underline]here[/underline] we saw
all [underline]but[/underline] the Serpent - An enormous Elephant
a young seven months old which was let
loose amongst us. 2 lions 2 lionesses one of
3 mo. & 2 of 7 mo - were there with a such
variety of other animals - leaving this
place we walked to Waterloo bridge & there
a boat to Westminster bridge - the view was
grand - the Cathedral - back of Somerset house &
Adelphi were striking features - We should have
enjoyed being on the water still more had not
there been of approaching thunder stroms. Which
some wish to be again on Terra firma. the rain at last

came - we landed as fast as we could - & intended
to stay in the poets corner in Westminster Abbey till
it was over - however this they would not show
so we took shelter - under the pallisade near
the house of Lords & eat our dinner of sandwiches
& veal pies. went from thence to St James Park
& crossed it coming out by the Palace - having a good
view of Buckingham house - & the back of the horse
gaurds - passed Carleton house & I think the
London Arcade - on to the British Gallery, which
is this year considered particularly attractive
as the paintings chiefly consist of the portraits
of
1st 8th mo - I have only time to
say that the [deletion]only[/deletion] joyful meeting
took place - last evening unexpectedly -
after a good passage of 18 hours
which Sarah much enjoyed. Thinking
the motion of the vehicle very pleasant
I send some medicines of my own make
elixir which spirits lavender & [deletion]Laudanum[/deletion]
& camphorated lineament
