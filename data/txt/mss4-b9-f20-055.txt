guarding the flock he seldom comes out here
I had a few pleasant lines from Lydia giving
as usual a good account of the young ones
the flowers are all coming forth in the
fine sunny weather thou would enjoy the
garden here, I long for the time of thy
coming again it is so pleasant to meet
& hear & tell all that passes [underline]real gossip[/underline]
how goes on Fanny? or when goes she off?
write to me when thou can I do not like writing
to Sally Davis till after my confinement as we
know not what may happen I wish it were well

My dear Elizth
I'm afraid thou wert inconvenienced by
my not writing sooner about Margt but I wish it
to wait to speak to her about the matter that
she might have a choice she is still anxious
to go to America but if she cannot accomplish
this plan she is contented to stay with us
she says she would not take a [unclear]thorough [/unclear]servants
place on her as she was never used
to cooking or washing, so that I believe she
will stay with us as I do not think she can
[insertion]get[/insertion] the means of taking her to America, Edw
seems to like & perhaps she may assist
in taking care of the children - as it is likely
when another comes more than one will
[deletion]lest be able[/deletion] he necessary to mind them
we are still at Glendruid where we [unclear]enjoy[/unclear]
ourselves this fine weather & I hope [unclear][/unclear]
[unclear]Margt[/unclear] is improving altho ' there are unavoidable
symptoms about her still the weather
was so severe till these last few days that
we could not let her out much or I think
there would have been a greater improvement
in the time we are here [deletion]nearly[deletion] more than
2 weeks I spent two days at home & was sorry
to find that R T had gone just the day before
I went to town I am sorry I miss'd seeing him
Edw stays at home pretty constentley [deletion]He[/deletion]
