Britain St 12 May
1822
Dear Elizabeth
I received your [underline]packet[/underline]
last night at 9 after coming home
from our fishing excursion; the
pleasure it gave me was enhanced
by its not being expected, I did not
know the writing that was on it,
while I was untying it, I was thinking
who it could be from, such a
large [underline]packet[/underline] for me, writing unknown.
Sarah told me you sent me some
seeds and flowers the latter I have
seen she put them down in the ground
and they look so well I believe I will
leave them as they are instead

of planting them formally as is
usual I have not seen mag. since
I came home I am confined all day
to the shop as formerly, She did not make
her appearance at the window, I promise
you to give her exercise when I can,
I have read Suliote's productions once I
intend to read them again before they
get out of my possession I think I may
shew them to Richard.
I have given RSL the bill of the [unclear]Stanel[/unclear]
& blue. do not think you gave me
trouble for in reality I never received
much pleasure or am so well satisfied
with myself as when I am doing Kindnesses
to those I esteem, though by wayward
circumstances it may seem otherwise
as to the fishing point of [deletion]the[/deletion] your
note I shall do my best, but I am
rather afraid of its fulfilment [unclear]with[/unclear]
many and sincere thanks for
your gifts especially the bachelors buttons
and more especially still for the loan
of Suliote
I am yrs
John B [unclear]L[/unclear]
The country is deliciously green
and young.
