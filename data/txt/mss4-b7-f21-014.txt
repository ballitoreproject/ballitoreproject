Patterdale near Penrith Nov: 17—
1800
My Letter assuredly will not be worth the postage, & as [unclear]Ld. Auck[/unclear]
knows I am in England, I cannot make use of his Sister to send
[unclear][/unclear] free of cost — This consideration ought to keep me silent,
[unclear]but[/unclear] if you will my dear Friend, send me such kind, & pleasing
[unclear]epistles[/unclear], this, you must pay for an answer, for I prefer taxing your
[unclear]but[/unclear], to the reproaches of my own Conscience, which wod. [unclear]upbr[/unclear]
with returning seeming neglect, for your affection — Your fav[unclear][/unclear]
the 19th, & Abraham's of the 30th. arrived at the same time, of [unclear]cou[/unclear]
[unclear]nswer[/unclear]you first, & knowing his [underline]patient disposition[/underline], I will
[unclear]post[/unclear]pone writing to him till I have more leisure,— in the mea[unclear][/unclear]
[unclear][/unclear], pray assure him, that I am not insensible to the kind 
his [unclear]Ltr.[/unclear]. I am extremely obliged to you, for enticing so [unclear]m[/unclear]
[unclear]tely[/unclear]into my feelings in imagination, you brought all
unclear]od[/unclear]Friends to my fireside — Would you cod. do it in reality!
 [unclear]Thos.[/unclear] Wilkinson was with me at the Crown at Penrith, at the
 [unclear]oment[/unclear] my Ballitore Ltres arrived, & that encreased the[unclear]pleasure[/unclear]
the whole you give me good accounts, & you will believe I
[unclear]rejoice[/unclear]joice in them. I am happy to hear sweet little Margaret
recover'd, & that her excellent Mother's health is not injured
[unclear][/unclear] the unremitting attention she has paid to the dear child.

Telll all my kind Friends at Ballitore, that I shall ever remember
them with lively satisfaction, & that they are in full possession of
my Esteem, & sincere good wishes. Thos. Wilkinson is well qualified to
increase my regard, & respect for your Society - He seems to know
[underline]you[/underline], as well as I do, we have no small pleasure in speaking of you,
for we are in perfect unison — I know your friendly heart will be
interested in the minutiae of my comforts, & disappointments, &
therefore you shall be introduced to them. Dear Lydia wod. tell you
that the House did not quite answer our expectation, I will describe it
the only sitting room is a parlour 12 by 14; anr. room the same size wth
a stone floor, I found it absolutely necessary to make a Kitchen of
[unclear][/unclear] a smoky miserable hole call'd a cooking Kitchen, scarcely ansd.
for a Scullery - anr. room abt. 8 [insertion]ft[/insertion] by 6 with a stone floor, (in which
[unclear][/unclear] my 2d Son sleeps) & a little passage place call'd a Pantry,
comprises the whole ground floor - Underneath, a Cellar, which
[unclear][/unclear] obliged to serve the double purpose of Cellar, & Dairy — upstairs
are two good bedchambers, the one occupied by my two eldest
Dautrs, the other [insertion]by[/insertion] myself - & a little light closet at the head of the
Stairs 6 by 4 contains a Bed for Jn:; [unclear]Turpy[/unclear] & Louis sleep in a
[unclear]ss[/unclear]bed in the Kitchen - The 3 Garrets [unclear]M[/unclear] represented
to T. Wilkinson as Lodging rooms for Servts., consist of 1 large
uncoil'd loft, open to the Stairs, without any door; two halls through
this [unclear][/unclear] in neither of which I can stand upright, both totally

dark, save that light which peeps through the faulty slates —
The poor Cook, I think at the [unclear][/unclear] of her life, sleeps in the
great loft, & I am: in the Stables — You see I have no room to
spare. This [unclear]indevant [/unclear] Alehouse, is push'd into the road, in order
I suppose to catch the thirsty Traveller, but as we do not sell ale,
this is particularly disagreable to us, & in other respects it is as
ill situated as it is possible to be, amidst such magnificent Scenery
The Sun does not bless us with his beams more than 3 [unclear]hours[/unclear]
the day — Here, we are resolved to stay till May, & therefore have
put in such articles of furniture as were absolutely necessary, &
no more — I return'd yesterday from a ride of 80 Miles, in search
of some pleasant spot in which we wish'd to fix our [unclear]Tent[/unclear]. We were
delighted with the situation of 2 little farms beside the Lake
of Coniston, which I fancy we shall purchase, with a view of
Building a Cottage, if we ever have the blessing of Peace, in the
meantime, we are offer'd (close beside our intended purchase) a small
House, with 2 sitt.g rooms, 4 [insertion]small[/insertion] bedrooms, & 2 Servt. rooms, Stables, Cow houses,
Barn &c, a small Garden & orchard, & 4 Acres of Land worth 40 &[unclear][/unclear], all
for 14 [unclear]Ges.[/unclear]. a yr. — all this promises much comfort & convenience, being
within 3 Ms. of a market Town &c — [underline]here[/underline], not a single article for Manor
House can be obtain'd, but at the distance of 14 Ms. — I pass'd two Nights at
Mr. Clarksons, ([unclear]Mr J[/unclear]. was ill, I cod. only go for a short time) I like him & his
Wife much, but they are 10 Ms. distant — The King of Patterdale is a very
good sort of Man, but not so polish'd as Jos: Manders, & I shod. suppose equal

well inform'd — The Queen (who was his Far's. Servt.) I am told has a dread of
seeing me — I saw her once at Church, but I do not think she deign'd to
bestow a look upon me, so you perceive I have little chance of rising
at Court. The Clergyman of the Parish is old, & works amongst his Potatoes
whilst his Lady & Maid Servant drive the Cart in search of Wood &c&c. [unclear][/unclear]
Their Son : a very decent young Man, (who gives us excellent Sermons)
keeps a School, teaches Writg., Arithmetick, Latin & Greek for half a Crown
a yr.!!! Learning is cheap, tho' proper food is dear — I am got to the end of my
aware of it, so pleasant is it to chat wth. you - Farewell! aggregated transcription (via algorithm)
We all join in every kind wish to you, & yours - [unclear]Turpy[/unclear] desires her "Duty" to
you - (tell me what in your opinion that consists in) & her Love to the Doyles.
I honor yr. Society for using only such words as have a literal meang — I sho[unclear][/unclear]
suppose my honest Turpy meant to say she Loved you Gratefully - at any [unclear][/unclear]
[unclear][/unclear] believe that I do - I shall be anxious to hear from you, especially as you

Does [unclear][/unclear] stay contentedly with [unclear][/unclear]
to know how Bayne goes on.
