Ballitore 18th. of 1 mo: 1826 -
Dear Edwd.
I think it is very probable the Judgmt.
agst. Jno. Christy of Irishtown in the County Kildare
was entered in my sister Mary Anne Higginson's [insertion]of Carlow[/insertion]
name as I belve. the Bond for £400 pound was made
payable to her as she gave me the money to put
out at Interest for her Son-in Law Puxley Fitzsimons
who was then residing in England - I should
have mentioned to thee that there was another
Jno. Christy of Kircassock in the County Down
I had his Bond for (I think it was) £150 pound I dont
know whether I entered Judgmt. on it or not, but
he became a Bankrupt & got only 18 (pence)
to the pound - Jno. Christy of Irishtown pd.
the Interest regularly for several years on the
£400
thy sincere frd.
