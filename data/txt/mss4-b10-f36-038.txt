 Dunlavin 8/26/34
My dear Eliza
It is very pleasant to hear so good an account
from home, as we had this morning by thy letter which
was truly welcome and not unexpected for I would
have been much disappointed if there had been none.
We are all well here, but a little in confusion as Catherine
went home sick on first day & they have not yet got
any one in her place, except Jane Morton to help at the
washing. This is very dismal weather, it rained here
yesterday morning as if it was coming out of a sieve, the
harvest I am afraid will be much injured. I believe
the last account I gave thee was of sixth day, we had
settled (F & I) if seventh was fine to set off & get to the
top of Lugnaquilla & the morning being beautiful &
the quicksilver on the rise we left this at ten oclock
with a snack in one pocket & a little bottle of port to
help us up, The view of the mountains as we went along
was as grand & clear as we could wish, we went by
Donard & over the hill strait from it down to the Glen
of Imael, still the day kept up clear & fine, save in
the distance there were here & there dark heavy looking
clouds, which I said I was afraid boded no good
still we kept on through the Glen which I think
is nearly three mile wide & form a large flat
basin, surrounded on all sides by Mountains & hill
except towards Stratford where there is a little peep out

it is a delightful place & I felt quite shut out from
the world, it is not at all bleak as the land is very
well cultivated & there is a good deal of wood. on we
went [deletion]till[/deletion] nearly to the foot of Lugnaquilla & stopped
at Paddy Kelly's, a man that Frank knows a real
Irish Dandie Dinmont, where we asked might we
leave our horses in his stable, "Yes." says he, "& a thousand
welcomes." the day now began to change
& we heard more than one clap of thunder, the
horses were safe lodged & F & I set off hoping the rain
would not come, but we had not walked more than
ten minutes when it began, it happened very fortunately
that there was a little cabin by the side of the
road where [insertion]we[/insertion] took shelter for nearly three quarters of
an hour, it was as miserable a one as ever I was in
there was neither table or chair & yet a man & his wife
& six stout looking children lived in it. the day instead
of cleaving looked still more dismal, & the rain abating
a little we thought it our wisest plan to make
the best of our way back to Pat Kelly's he had got
his wife to light a fire in the best room in which
were two beds, & there he was ready to receive us
the rain having driven him in from his cornfield
where he had been very busy & had gathered a parcel
of the neighbours to help him, his disappointment
was greater than ours yet he bore it very good humouredly.
desired his wife to lay the cloth & bring
us the few potatoes that she had left at the fire & the
piece of his own ham, & two large tins of nice milk

Pat had eaten his dinner before, but out of complaisance
to us he sat down with us. neither F nor I
were very hungry but we took share of what they
offered, all this time it rained very heavy at last
towards half past two it brightened, the rain ceased &
we set off home at quarter past three the sun shining
& the day as clear as it was in the morning, not a little
disappointed at not being able to put our plan in execution,
we went round the other side of the Glen by
the farm which belonged to James Fenton. to lighten
our pockets we gave our snacks to the first poor looking
person we met. we just tasted our little bottle of port
& brought the rest home safe where we arrived after six
hungry & pretty well tired. they gave us tea
& a bit of fried meat which was very palatable.
give my Mother & Lucy an account of our
trip, they fully expected we would have come
home wet through as they had had terrible rain also.
told them of Paddy Kelly & his hospitality his mother
is alive & lives with him, he had also a granddaughter
so there are four generations in the house which is only
a poor cabin, the pigs & poultry having permission to
enter it when they like. I have given thee a long
account of one day, we were all lazy the next
morning and none of us went to meeting my Mother
& F & I took a little jaunt before dinner it was
a cool day but fine here & many of the people were
at work both at the hay & corn, which I think is
quite allowable, there was one holiday since we came

down which they did not work it was a beautiful
day, & they might have got a great deal done, but they would
not be let they said, the following first day we saw several
at work so what dost thou say to that. this day
has been fine, Anthony Allen was in the town in his
gig at six this morning to hire men so he is an
early man. Frank & I took a side round by [unclear]Burnto[/unclear]
Hall & were not home to breakfast till past nine
I suppose it is the last ride we will take as he has
turned out his mare to grass today that she may be
fattened a little against Rathsallagh fair which will
be next week, he does not think her safe to ride as
she often makes a false step. tell Manliff I
Penny Post

think there is a great scarcity of black waist coats & their wearers in
this part of the country as my eyes have not been gladdened with
the sight of one since I came down. Will he come to the fair
we will be looking for him, if we should be here untill then my
Mother seems finely in pretty good spirits & I think likes Dunlavin
so well that she would like to live here, tell Manliff there
is a bed for him here & that we will be glad to see him. tell
Arthur that Bally-hook is still to be set & that when we were
out this morning we we were saying how pleasant it would
have been to go over to him to breakfast. I did not hear of
any other place near this to be let, but I can be on the
look out. the two sheep are at grass with Martin Windee
I believe are well taken care of. did all the rest get
home safe. I have not begun to like the people about
here yet, the country I like very well particularly near
the mountains I wish the weather would take up that
we might [insertion]have[/insertion] a few more jaunts before we leave this.
I have not been in Ballitore neither have I heard
any thing of them since I have just now been helping
Lucy to churn her little sup of milk which she does

in the crock as we used in winter when we had but little
Fanny was not very well but is now finely again Emy & [unclear]Rejy[/unclear]
well. I think the former remembers thee quite well & shews
[underline]E[/underline] for Aunt [unclear]Lya[/unclear] - Lucy bids me tell thee that she has sold
the little frock marked 1/10d for 1/6d & that now the ice is broke
perhaps the others will go. she desires her love & so does Frank &
that the two sheep are grazing at Grange-bey under the care
of M Windees herd. my Mother also send her love & says
she is pleased to hear thou art getting on so well - she does not
know what day to settle about going home but I told her it
was time enough the next time we write she is afraid
her hay rick will be spoiled by the wet but she would not
wish other work of more consequence to be left undone.
What is it ails John - he is very often complaining give my
love to him & Martha when thou sees them or art writing
to them. Why has not Elizabeth gone out to see thee but I
suppose as she used to be so busy on [underline]Mary street[/underline] she will
be [underline]twice[/underline] as busy in [underline]Dominick st.[/underline] Has my Aunt Fayle
come home yet it is not very fine weather she has for
the country. be sure to write soon again & hoping

you will all continue well & that we may find you
so when we return with dear love to Manliff Arthur
& thyself I am thy affect. sister Selina
love to Sarah & Margt is the latter with thee often
