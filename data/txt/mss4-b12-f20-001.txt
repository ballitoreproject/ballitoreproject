Dublin 19th of 3rd mo. 1847.
My dear Eliza
We duly received thy letters from Liverpool
& London & were glad to hear of your progress so far without
annoyance. Some letters came here for Thomas after you
had sailed, which Arthur would have forwarded immediately,
if he had known your address, or that of Geo. Crawfords.
They have since been [insertion]read[/insertion] by one of the Kifts, who said they were
of no consequence. This house seems quite lonesome without
Thomas. He is missed more here in the day time. than
at Glenageary. I have [insertion]not[/insertion] seen Isabella since the evening we
parted, but I attended to [insertion]thy[/insertion] directions on my return from the
Packet. Lucy is to be in Town tomorrow with Emy. I am
glad they are coming to make a little variety for thy Mother.
who is I hope after her best fashion. She went to meeting on
first day, & to Fassaroe the next, in her Brougham, accompanied
by aunt Fayle. They found Dick very poorly
preparing to go town as new symptoms have appeared
in addition to his former delicacy - both palpitation of the
heart, & swelling of the limbs. He looks very badly, but is in
good spirits. 18th fifth day - Dr. Moss has seen his
patient several times since he came from the country &
thinks him a little better this morning as the swelling has
abated in degree. & his pulse is improved. He is trying some
new medicine & has remained quietly in bed for the last
two days. If the amendment continues he is to return to
Fassaroe again this week. His pulse was up to [underline]110[/underline] - on 2nd

day night after the journey. He got on so well after the amputation,
one cannot but regret the want of care since.
I hope however, we shall have no worse news to send of our
circle during thy absence, & that you will be permitted
to return to us in safety & with renewed health & spirits.
Manliff has been setting potatoes both this week & last,
& Arthur has at length treated himself to a few. We get
excellent ones in Moore St. at 2/- per stone.
When one sees great variety the time appears very long,
& as this remark may apply to thee, I suppose thou wilt
be expecting a budget of news from me, forgetting that a
few days only have elapsed since thy departure.
The day after you left us was remarkably fine. I brought Aunt
Fayle into Town to see the house in Eustace St. we were thinking
of for her, & [unclear]Co.[/unclear] & A. B. It belongs to Friends, & was formerly
occupied by Abbey Wright. As the situation is central & the rent
is low, I think it likely matters will be arranged for them, but
the prospect is dull for Alex- as he has left Bridge St. & has
no other employment in view. We however, look more
to Anne for help. I think with my Aunts assistance [insertion]&[/insertion] by furnishing
a couple of bedrooms they might live almost rent
free. Both Ewd. & Richd. have seen the house, & think favorably
of it. Some one must go security for the rent, of which, half
a year will be allowed for repairs & cleaning -
Jane Allen took the first step towards her marriage on
third-day, also Maria Manly. Wm. Doyle has taken a house
on the Donybrook road. It is probable they will be settled in it before
thy return. People in business are beginning to feel the depression
more & more, & that is the cause of A. B. leaving the Allen's. J. R. Webb is
also dismissed. G. Stephens is likely to lose her situation, as
the Pims [underline]have[/underline] [insertion]to[/insertion] retrench, the late J. P. did not die solvent I hear.

19th
I am still in
town but
[insertion]am[/insertion] to return to
with Emy-
Kindest love
to Thomas
& thyself
from your
affec[insertion]ate[/insertion]
