Ballitore 15th of 1st month 1782

My dear friend
++ Our last accounts from Clonmel are very alarming respecting the vessel in which Edith and Jo Sparrow sailed. The following has appeared I suppose in the Cork newspaper. Extract of a letter from ^Bristol to^ a gentleman in this city, dated 1st January 1782A Passenger from the Elizabeth packet brings account that she went on shore in Barrow-bay, this side Bridgewater, on Sunday night last, where she now lies. Report says that thirty people were lost, the Captain supposed to be of the number. We cannot as yet learn farther about this unfortunate affair. My son Samuel Grubb mentions that his aunt Sparrow is in great distress. However this may be, we do not feel here as thought this dreadful event had been permittedwe rather hope, better things, and that the rumour may be altogether false, or that some mistake has occasioned it.
