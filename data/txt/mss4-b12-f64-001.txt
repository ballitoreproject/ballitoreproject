We had a visitor lately - as I was walking over the water
I heard an [underline]Old Scho[deletion]l[/deletion]lar[/underline] was just alighted at Brother's - I had no cause to expect
one more than another, yet instantly the Idea of Leadbeater occured - He is the
pretty gentle youth, whom thou blamed me one night at the summer-meeting
for not asking to supper - So accordingly it was he - a fresh proof of instinct,
for which I hold myself remarkable! - Thou may imagin the old [deletion]fuss[/deletion] [insertion]rout[/insertion] there was.
He spent most of his time with me, & seemed in the confidence of friendship to
unbosom many sentiments to me which I admired - He has served his time to
an Attorney, but sick & shocked at the fraud of the profession, will not be sworn -
but has taken a farm, & proposes to lead a retired life - for he reckons he sees
many disagreeable things, & the world appears not so pleasant to him since
he left Ballitore where he reckons he received good impressions which he hopes
not to lose. Indeed I fear (but should I not say I hope?) he will not continue
long in the world as he seems rather inclined to a decay. He went with my
Father to Carlow to Ben Whittons marriage, & thence to Athy where we

joined them, & he accompanied us till within a few miles of Mt.melick -
he was at Mt. melick (came 6 miles) first day, sate beside me while I was
dining at John Gatchell's, being exhibited to the view of a number of friends
Why have not I strength to correct those affections which are lawful in
their place? - why am I so carried away by old scholars [insertion][underline]boys![/underline][/insertion] - I am sensible [unclear][/unclear]
is to my hurt - This amiable youth has a resemblance of Dear Tommy
Watson which endears him more [deletion][/deletion]
