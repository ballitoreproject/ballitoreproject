Dear Wm,
If I am at all acquainted with sweet sympathy,
I think I have felt it with thee since we parted, & I have
from my heart wished thy preservation as my own, & that
nothing of any kind whatsoever may be able to harm us
Oh! that we may be enabled to keep upon our watch, for
we have a cruel spoiler to guard against, a cunning
tursting enemy:—but this is going from what I thought
I had alone to say. I took a quiet minute, the evening of
the day thou left this, to communicate thy message to my
mother, & indeed [underline]I[/underline] felt relieved when I had so done.- I
told her thou had been a good while attatched to the object
in question, that thou wert very desirous to do rightly,
& in the right time, & way, —that my father’s absence from
home, & nanny’s illness, along with thy own diffidence, made
it hard to thee to speak now I believed:—& that thou did
not think it amiss to speak [deletion] e [deletion] to her through me,—that
thou went willing to let it abide with her, for her serious
consideration, & wished her when she thought fit, to impart
the matter to my father. This is as well as I remember
what I said,—I wish to know if it has thy approbation.
My mother seemed rather surprised, said it
was a matter required solid thought, & she intended to

be thinking about it, till she saw, & communicated it
to my father. I also did I hope asist in calming M’s
mind, [underline] if it was tossed, [/underline] but without mentioning to her this
subject we are upon:—she seems cheerful & comfortable
with no notion (I believe) of what is done. Now, my dear
friend, of thou thinks of any other way in which I can
serve thee, thou wilt oblige me, by informing there of.
Our monthly meeting is to be held in Athy tomorrow,
I mean to put this myself in the office. If thou writes me
send it to T. Chandlee’s care for me. We have got poor
nanny removed down stairs to the far parlour, she thinks
the room cooler than the one she removed from. - I believe
she grows weaker, else there is not much alteration
this some time back. We have a very dull account
of Jenny Haughton, I believe her recovery is doubtful,
I think her complaint is called an inflamation in
her bowels. I send my love to no one but thyself
because this is a secret correspondence: — perhaps thou
wilt trust A: Shannon more, as thou has a little, if so
my dear love awaits her always. Use me, dear William,
as thou chuses, I hope I shall always be willing to
serve thee, as far as in my power, & rest thy truly
affectionate friend.
S: Shackleton.

Turn at Killcullen.
