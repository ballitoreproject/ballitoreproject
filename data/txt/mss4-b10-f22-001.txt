Dear Miss Bennington.
I fear I have
forgotten to send you the
[unclear]Deb[/unclear]. [underline]Bond[/underline]. I cannot recal
it if I did; so I now post
you another copy. I am
a good deal pressed with
 various duties attaching to
my post here, [unclear]and have[/unclear]
undertaken to fill the Bond
mostly with my own thoughts,
so I sometimes miss in posting
the Bond to those who should receive it.
I have been making up a [unclear]full[/unclear]
list, embracing a certain number

of Mechanic's Institutes, and the
old and long time workers in
the cause. I think I will send
one monthly & your Mechanic's
Institute in Banbridge, as well
as to yourself. I hope you will
read the sent with all your
old interest, though it will be
somewhat changed.
Yours truly
Elihu Burritt
