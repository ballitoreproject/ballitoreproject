My dear Mamma
Many thanks for
your very kind note received
the day before yesterday, it
is delightful to hear from
you, & that you are well,
which thank goodness we are
too - Arthur & Myself took
a beautiful drive yesterday,
Manliff did not come as he

had some job he wanted to
do on board. We went out
to Ballincollig to see my
old friend Mrs Spedding whose
husband is Chaplain to the
Artillery there, we found her
place, but she was out, however
we saw her daughter,
who has been ill, & came
down from lying on the bed
to see me, but I was greatly
disappointed at not seeing
her Mamma, we came home
by Blarney Castle and
Mr Barter's water cure
establishment, and quite
enjoyed some beautiful
Scenery - We are just going
to take a little sail about
here today so I cannot write
any more at present, except
to give Manliffs & Arthur's
love to you all, please write
a line & believe me your
much attached M J B ,
Manliff would be obliged if
you would send the fresh newspaper
[underline]each day[/underline] after you
read it â€”
