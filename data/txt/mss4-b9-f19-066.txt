My dear E - I wrote a few lines to RTL
I hope he deliver'd my message to thee
I send S Wright's patterns I wish thou
wouldst send me the colour thou'd like
& I will try to get it for thee I recd the
eggs safe & would have written by Connor
but the candles were sent unknown to me
& I thought Nelly Lennon would have gone
to Ballitore before this time, I hope poor R T L
will soon be able to walk, how well it was
that thou could go to him, I enclose what
I wrote first & also Betsy's letter for
which I am greatly obliged it gives
such satisfactory information
farewell ever thine SB
Maggie is stout
but doesnt stand alone
I heard of the birth of G Bewley's son Thos
he was worth waiting so long a time for
