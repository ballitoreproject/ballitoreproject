Tuesday
Dearest Wife
I dont think
I can go over to,
[unclear]monroe[/unclear] - Mr.
White is in Belfast
& wishes to see me
and I shall have
to go down and
it would be too
late on my return.
I would not wish
to interfere much
with your inclinations -
- but I am
sorry to hear you
intend going to
Fassaroe again -
I would rather
you were not going
at present - In Lyd's

present state - nurses
are quite as useful
as you can be &
I dont approve of
your sitting up
& slaving yourself
so much -
Let me know if
I shall send the
car for you on
Thursday -
I want the studs
badly out of the
wrist of my soiled
shirt
ever yours
