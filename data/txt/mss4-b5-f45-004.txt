Esteemed Friend
The Writing Desk was the last
Article that I had for the School House
Wm. Leadbeater observed that there would
be something left after the Charge of the
Desks that would make a few [unclear]Foiverns[/unclear],
to procure for me last Summer, if
the [unclear]Focerns[/unclear] are made I will send
for them, as they are much wanting,
We had in all but six [unclear]focorms[/unclear] and six
small tables: if thee thinks well of sending
[26 Feb.]
any more young trees to Ballibarney

the sooner we would have them now the
better before the busy season comes on. I
would be exceedingly obliged to thee for One
thousand small Larch to complete a little
Nursery in the Garden. On the 5th December
last we had 240 Larch Trees from thee for
[unclear]Ballibainey[/unclear] which were planted the next day
Ballibarney which were planted the next day
I will wait on thee in the course of this
week if I possibly to see about the Trees
