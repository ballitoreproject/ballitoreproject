Dublin : 8th of 2d month 1791.
My dear William,
Though I could not blame myself much for not returning with Jo
Haughton, because it seemed rather impracticable, yet that day he went I
grew very thoughtful about returning, & after having indulged some reflections
on the subject, thy letter of the 3.d inst: was put into my hand, which increased
my longing to meet thee again, & determined me to go home this week; & Wm.
Pim arriving that evening, I planned to take the advantage of his company
to Sallins, & previously request a horse might be sent to me there, & fifth
day was the time he proposed going - But John & Anne Robinson ([unclear]Bridesland[/unclear])
inform me that they mean to send Wm. White under my care to Ballitore,
which a little deranged my plan, because we all thought it would be necessary
for you to consult about, & inform me of the way we should go from the boat
sooner - Now the way I should propose would be to have a car, a good common
car, with plenty of straw, meet us at Sallins, on which the little boy &
I, & our luggage, could be conveyed home with little trouble - but would wish
the car to come in time to let the horse rest, that we might set out immediately
on landing - for my own part I should much prefer riding on
horseback, if it was thought Wm. White could undertake the journey; a
carriage would be quite against my choice, unless it was judged absolutely necessary
on his account, & in that case I should wait, they say for an answer,
supposing I should take one from Sallins - I did mean to have (notwithstanding
& as I did not hear of his coming till first-day, I could not inform you

all this) written that I would go on fifth day, when I received thine of
the 6th inst. last night, but my friends here were quite dissatisfied I should
go, on what they reckoned rather an uncertainty, especially not knowing
whether to take or leave my clothes, & Wm. Pim also seemed to join them; all
reckoning two days would make little difference - Therefore, after some little
debating within & without, I have concluded to leave this in the early boat
on seventh-day morning; & expect a letter from thee on sixth-day, letting me
know what conveyance we are to have from Sallins, a car still seeming most
eligible to me, & the weather fine & days lengthening - And now, my
beloved Wm., let me sincerely say I am much obliged to thee for so kindly
& generously treating me, & I may also say, believing it will be agreeable
to thee to hear that I have spent my time very agreeably, have had
full satisfaction of my visit, & have staid full as long as the time I
purposed in my own mind; & now hope to be dealt gently with at my
return, for after being made so much of here, I am afraid I should be
hard set to bear the blame I may deserve; though if my own heart &
thou accuse me not, I shall think less of the reproaches of others. Often do
I think of the great advantage of Humility, in that it would dispose
the mind with calmness, & perhaps even cheerfulness, to bear what might
appear severe & mortifying; because one would then think it their due, &
even should it appear beyond the desert of the present offence, should look
upon it as the punishment for some other - To attain to this desirable
state seems to me one of the greatest blessings on this side the grave,
but alas! I feel often that I am far from this attainment. - No I am
not angry with [underline]thee[/underline], nor with any one else - though would rather not be
found
+ Please however if we arrive not in the 1st boat, let whoever comes wait for the 2d, also to assist me in getting my
things brought out. How are the children & all the family?

fault with to be sure; I took it very kind of thee to let me know how
matters stood, & hope my not going before seventh-day will be excused,
& also hoping that, if particularly wanting home, I shall get an order by
to-morrow's post to depart [deletion]to[/deletion]-next day, which I believe I should punctually
obey. The locks not being made I bespoke those of 2/2, which I hope
will be ready soon. The enquiry about R: Lingwood was made by Anne
Pike in a meeting capacity I apprehend, relating to her certificate.
There was written on the back of Mother's letter with a pencil, "1 [unclear][/unclear]
"1/2 flat iron," it seemed uncertain whether by accident or design, but
it would have been sent I believe but was forgot. Yesterday morning
I received thine sent by E Hetherington, & the two guineas, for wch I am
obliged, it was quite as much as I wanted. I was flattered
by thy attention to my appearance, which is pretty decent
I think, nor am I alone in this opinion. Thou would have [unclear]have[/unclear]
pitied me a little I believe had thou known how I felt on finding my
two last letters so [underline]very short[/underline], for somehow I expected [deletion]they[/deletion] each a good
deal longer; but I soon got over it, knowing how much thou art hurried,
& not knowing what additional circumstances of hurry might be, &
more than all, believing I want no proof of thy love, which is above
all temporal things of most value to thy
Mary Leadbeater.
