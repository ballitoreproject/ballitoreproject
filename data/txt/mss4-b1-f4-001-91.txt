asylum, a sanctuary to flee to, wherein they find protection and
safety!

From the Same to the Same.
Ballitore 12th of Thirdmonth 1792.
*** I would not have thee be too concise, nor get a habit
of concealing and suppressing, under an apprehension that thy
communications are little-worth. worth. There is danger on that head; though,
as it grows out of the stock of humility, it may be said to be
erring on the right side, not on the left. But I would have my
beloved S. err on no side, but keep in the middle-way, out of
all extremes. "I [wisdom] lead in the way of righteousness, in
the midst of the paths of judgment". ** It is a certain truth,
that when any are engaged in the Lord's business, and see the
pointings of His hand to particular service, much trouble would often
be saved by simply making use of the opportunity put into the hand,
and not deferring, procrastinating, and reasoning, till the vision fadeth
the understanding becomes clouded, and the strength and spiritual animation
is gone. **
R. S.
