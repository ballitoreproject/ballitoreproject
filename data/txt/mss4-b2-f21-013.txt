Dungannon the 3d of 3d Month 1776
Dear Richard/
on My Coming home last night from being at our Province Meeting (held in Lisburn) w^h^ere, and here and I have, (say Larger Moyallow &c) I had been on business, some Concerning This world and some Concerning that which is to Come, & had Spent about Tendays I Received, Thine of the 22d Past in Answer, my Peggys Nupials must not be delayd one day, nor her fathers face suffer a blush for a moment by any neglect of His Friend, Inclosd I send Thee Jonathan Dawson Coates and Pa[?] Lawless Bank note N 25 my favor on Demand for Two Hundred Pounds by way of Earnest that the Remainder Shall be remitted in due Time to Answer the Occation, in My Reply to this say whether Thou would Chuse to have the Remaining part remitted in this way, or a Credit lodgd in Dublin for the accepting of the draft or drafts upon a friend share so as to fall due before the 17th next month
	This Corrispondance about money matters seems to be like our selves, mingled here and there with something of a Religeous sort, I wish the latter may through time be uppermost, its hard, and I find it so, to Keep the moon under foot, when it appears Bright we like to look upon it, and Contemplate its Beauty, and Allmost feel a Wish we were aded to its Inhabitants, but when we again observe upon the Vicisitudes its lyable unto, We again Wish to be redeemed from Intangable, and Established in that which Changes not,
	I observe Thou has not yet Alltogether digested my making one mash as thou Calld it; of your province, and Pleads in Lattan Too, my allowing you the Liberty I take to myself, for such I guess My Lattan to be from the Contex, I Confess I have long been Jealous that the People in General, and Every Rank of them in particular, have long been too fond of being fed by the Ears, give us flesh that one may Eat; for as for this Mana[?] we Cannot bring our Selves to the dayly gathering of it may we are Weary of the Employment; there seems near affinity between this, and make us Gods to go before us, for as to this man Moses we wot not what is become of him, Language befiting a Restless, doubling, Lusting People, a People Equaly Void of Faith and Patience, neither having had its perfect work in them; some I know there are who Know these things, and See the danger the multitude are in; But who are ^not^ Willing to Sanctifiee themselves in the manner they should do, You Elders who see and feel should do it, its your province its your works; and your stations calls upon you to do your own Business; and not Call upon Ministers whose time of duty lies in another Channicle, But stop Rambleing pen,  Dear Jonathan Gough is well I think Every way, I allways Loved the man, but lateraly with a Nearness I cant well describe, I now think him a great man; and most chearfully give him the Right hand of fellowships; one time I turn him in my own mind, a Son of Thunder, and at others Esteem him as one of the Old Prophets arose from the dead; indeed Such is the Unity between us that who Ever spakes first seen to Relieve the other of his Burthen, and if there be an adition its in the same line; some years agoe I bemoaned my situation on the Removal of John Hancock and John Christy from my side, but what shall I now say? That Great Good Hand that Removed has Raisd up again, and in the same meetings Too; Blessed be His Holy Name, His Mercys are Indeed great to his Church and People, 
	Peggy Wishes to hear from me, What shall I say Concerning her? She is going to be married, what is best to be done? first of all, and above all others, Invite Jesus to the marriage, His Company will Sanctifie the Connexion; His Blessing Will will render it Happy, Previous Provision may be large, and apparently sufficient, yet in the course of things a shortness of Wine may fall out, His presence and attention to His Commands, will make up all deficiencys; and give strength, to that which before was Weak; After marriage I suppose He is to mingle amongst the Green aprons of Munster, but let her not Expect that these are allways an Emblem of a contrite Heart, Green aprons and very dry hearts may be found together, yet let her not stumble at the discovery; When I recolect Two Leinster friends, who I hope are mothers in Israel, and ^when^ Esteem as such, I fear I may be Arraignd for this remark, but alow me to make my defence, Where leaves, Branches, and Trunk are Green & fruitfull together, all is well, a Uniform Beauty displays it self through the Whole but alass what does it avail to patch (for Patch work it is, and patch work of Lincy Woolsey Too) Green Leaves on dry Trees, it Cant stand the storms of a future Trying day, an atumn Blast will Wither and blow fugitive; I wish My Peggy to be all of a Piece, I hope she will be a Kings Daughter; Beauty within, transcends, my desire for her is, that in this she may Excell; the Purging seasons lead to it, The renewed turning of the Rejining[?] Hand makes fruitfull in the Vine, and Presences fresh, and Green, in the Vineyard; and then in my opinion its not material whether the apron be Green, Blue, White, or none at all, if Thy good Wife sees this I think she will be saying there is no moving This man out of his old road, he has a strange way of reasning about things; Would she have me let go mine Integrity? Should I be single and alone in my sentaments; I seem resolved that my heart shall not reproach me so long as I live, but however she may Judge me I hope she will not account me a Heretick, in the worst sence of the Word, 
	With Dear Love to Her, Lister, Aby Thompson & Childrin I Remain Thy Sincere friend Thomas Greer
