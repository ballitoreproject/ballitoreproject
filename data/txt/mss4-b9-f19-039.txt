My dear Elizth many thanks for thy letter I wonder
could thou send me the muslin in a pink, Lydia
is enjoying herself highly, thy letter went to her the day after
its arrival here of course unopen'd Deborah came
back the better of her excursion she saw the Doctor &
got advice & a bottle. Ah poor M R how must
she feel & sym[deletion]a[/deletion]pathise with the young widows!
I can conceive no greater distress than to be bereft
as Mary is, except [deletion]any[/deletion] [unclear]Ring[/unclear] brought on by ourselves
ill conduct &, so happy as she was & now so forlorn,
I dont know how she will post thee are
any of her relations thinking of going to her?
but her sweet children they will if spared to her
always be her comfort. - now look to a brighter
prospect & think of poor Lydia how happy is she
& still I believe fully aware of the uncertainty belonging
to every thing & thinking of her future happiness
while she trembles I often think of Scott's simile
of the Lake [deletion]in dec[/deletion]
S W has left us
we thought him
much improved
& were sorry for him, Lucy Barrington is
I wish she would lose it & become more free
we go to the mill to morrow I hope [unclear]mixing[/unclear] with
The mountain shadows on her breast
Were neither broken nor at rest
In deep uncertainty they lye
Like future joys to fancy's eye
with a simple, amiable creature & extremely reserved

The neighbour will be of use to her, I will put this
in my pocket & write when I can, but first M Doyle
is very agreeable & quiet I think we have more
to do now but with a great deal more regularity
poor Jane was quick & good enough when she chose
But that as we all know was not always
I wonder what J Fennel will say to James & Lydia when she hears
but it in secret at present I hope the bleach gown will
answer I left Dudley Cokely below stairs with my father
he dined with us, & gave us a good deal of [underline]religion[/underline] &c &c
he looks fat & well walk'd into town yesterday to our
surprise who were all [unclear]coopetaning[/unclear] who might
be the stranger he got a lodging at Dolly Zacar's
Rich Webb left us to day for Dublin he & Fit enjoy'd themselves
very much in Wexford they got to Waterford the
day after D Grubb had left they would have been
very glad to have seen her
Sarah let me read her letter - I think
I could almost cry to see the carelessness
of her writing - She is so good & agreeable
too, that I wish she would in this take
advice.
