My Dear Uncle,


        I have a piece of intelligence to impart, which I fear will give thee concern, however as in all probability it will be conveyed by another channell [sic], & might thus occasion thee more trouble by having certain circumstances left out in the narration, I thought it most advisable to acquaint thee that I am now dispossessed of the employment thy goodness procured meThis happened last night in the manner thou shalt hearAbout ten days ago I brought from the Post Office a letter directed for William Penrose which I delivered to his Wife who after she had opened it & read a part told me it had been before opened I assured her that I was ignorant of such a thing happening & that she had it just as I received itthis did not satisfy her I again assured her of my innocence & afterwards when he came in had the same assurances to repeatIn the evening he called me asidecautioned me to be careful what answer I made him & then after that preparation asked me if I could give my affirmation that what I said what true I assured him I could & as I saw so little confidence could be had in my word (although I am not conscious of giving him reason to doubt my veracity) I thought it absolutely necessary for me to clear myself from such an imputation I appeared before a magistrate the following day & made an affirmation which I hoped might free me from any farther suspicion however I had not the satisfaction to learn that was the case as they never made any remark to me on the subjectAt the same I came to the resolution of avoiding suspicion in future & determined never to call for their Letters in future tis true my heart was so full at the time of giving him the written Affirmation that I did not let him know the conclusion I came to however I judged If he thought I had any spirit at all He must feel that I could not be expected to pass by such an aspersion unnoticedHe has several times of late betrayed a suspicion of my suppressing Letters which might if I had been quick sighted enough have given me warning how to act [paper folded] all my care to prevent any thing disagreeable [obscured by seal] was useless for yesterday our Letters left neglected [obscured by seal] the Post Office until night when he surprised me by desiring I should go for them at first I hesitated on his repeating his order I desired to be excused for the above reasonHe said he would not excuse me & insisted I should I then told him in plain terms I would not he then without farther ceremony declared I should quit the Office & was genteel enough to push me out like a common vagabondSuch is the plain matter of fact without any comment which I am assured I lay before an impartial FriendIf G & WP should find they have any farther occasion for my services to set their Accounts in a proper train so that another may succeed to my employment I shall make no objection to comply with their desire but after the indignity I have suffered I can not be expected to continue with them longer than necessity requiresPlease present me with much affection to all at home & believe me to be thy dutiful Nephew
