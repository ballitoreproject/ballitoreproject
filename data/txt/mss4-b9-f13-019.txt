Richmond 30th of 1st month 1827.
My beloved Sister
I did not indeed hear until this moment
that Edwd was ill again - & I am grieved to hear
it - but I hope as thy letter says that the worst is over
My darling. I wish I was near thee - but I have nothing
but my heart's sympathy to offer thee - Oh what trials
thou hast had. - have we all had since this time
twelvemonth - & thou most of all. I wrote to thee
yesterday all in spirits & too cheery a letter, I wish
I had it now. - I was fretting about you - from
thinking of thee greatly - but not that I had heard
any thing - but from your silence. May I ask thee
to write [deletion]ther[/deletion] very very soon - or surely John
would do it or one of the girls. I shall be
wishing greatly to hear again - was it a relapse
of the fever. If he is able to receive it give Edwd
my dearest love - Oh! that I had the children here
I can never assist when any of you are in trouble
I am so far away. My very dear Sister - I opened your
letter as soon as it came & immediately dispatched a messenger
with it to Lydia - my poor Sarah how we feel for you -
We have no idea of Edwards relapse, but your letter makes us hope
that now the worst is over - We were negligent of writing as
we thought he was quite recovered - When your mind is easy
you will write again & let us know particulars - Most heartily
do I join Lydia in the desire that we were near enough to

assist you in any way - My dear Sister keep up your heart
& I expect all will be well - what a frightful illness poor
Elizabeth has struggled through - We hear today that she has
been up - I am glad you heard from Sally - I hope she will
hear or has heard of poor Edwd's illness, that she may not
be coming upon you unexpectedly - but she would assist you
in any way with a heart right glad to serve you - & dont
fail to ask [deletion]you[/deletion] [insertion]her[/insertion] to do any thing for you. I am sure
she loves you like a sister - Our affectionate regards for
Edward when he is well enough to receive them - You
will write again if only a few lines to let us know how
Edwd goes on - Affectionately farewell my dear Sarah
Yours ever J J F
