				Ballitore [blank space] 1779.
	I rejoice, and partake, and join in the harmony which thou mentionest to subsist in our family. Each of us has the high fit, the low fit, and the cross fit; and if there be not mutual forbearance and condescension, we shall lose peace on earth. In music there are not only different chords and strings, but stops and pauses. Let us seek to be ordered and modulated by the soul of harmony, Divine love; and if we cannot go forward in service, and find our own minds not under present qualification to help others, let us stand still till we renewedly feel and know that good is present with us. Thus minding our stops and movings, the locking and unlocking of the key, which opens & none can shut, and shuts and none can open, we shall walk wisely & usefully in our several lots in life. ***			R. S.
