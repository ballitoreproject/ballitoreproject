The Convincement of Frances Henshaw
It is about one year and a half since God was pleased to declare to me his
Divine will in manner following
That if I would Obey & be governed by his will he would accept
me & make me a disciple of his beloved Son but to attain this diseriable blessing
he required that I should entirely lay aside all the vanitys & foolish Amus[insertion]e[/insertion]ments
of this world which are a great hindrance to our Spiritual progress & suffer not
His word [deletion]to in[/deletion] when receed to take effectual Root in the heart this I experienced
to be very true therefore implored his divine assistance to enable me to lay aside
whatever was contrary to his divine will or might hinder my performing

very ill) that I was in so great a Concern if it was only
on her Acct. he begged me to be content beleiving as he said
her illness was no ways [deletion]fatal[/deletion] fatal but would be removed
in God's good time if my concern was on my own
Acct. he said I must apply to God, his Holy Word for
Assistance & relief & submitt my self entirely to him
who is all powerfull to relieve the Afflicted & distressed What
fault could I find with this Advice? I knew it agreeable to
Scripture & right Reason & had it proceeded from the
mouth of a turk I should have been desirous to have put it
in practice but how great was my concern when I found
not from him but a secret impulss till that time unknown
to me that to be a disciple of Christ I must know a thro' change
in life & manners become a new Creature be born again
