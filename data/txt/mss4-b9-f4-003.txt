Richmond 24th of March 1824
My dear Edward
I am happy to inform you &
dear Sarah if she be still in Dublin that our dear Lyd
is finely after the birth of a little boy and sends you
her very best love - He was born yesterday evening
about 4 o'clock too late for me to send you the good
news - You will be kind enough to let them know
at Glendruid & tell Eliza that at Lydia's request I
mean to have the pleasure of writing to her in a few
days to tell her how we go on - I also beg you will
send a note to George Downes as he & Wilhemina have
been very particular in their enquires after Lyd.
Poor Lyd was very ill indeed but is now after a quiet
night's rest much better than we could have expected.
My mother requests you will also communicate
the good news to Mary Humphreys & Debby Johnson.
You cannot expect me to answer your last kind
letter here but it shall not escape my notice.
With very dear love to Sarah if she be with you or
wherever she is
I am your affecte brother
