My dear Wm.,
& as sister Mary is sending a frank to your house
I am for taking the opportunity, as thou seems to wish it,
of sending thee a few lines again, - & that Molly may not
mistrust me, I must again enclose it to A: S. - & as thou
seemed & still seems desireous for poor me to tell my own
sentiments, I intend to do so in freedom, & [underline]sisterly[/underline] love, but
do not thou betray them. This thing of [underline]matrimony[/underline] I do
think a very great thing, an abundance of duties [underline]then[/underline]
[underline]comes[/underline] to fill up, for my part I do not think [underline]I[/underline] would be
atall equal to it, & often wish (if best) not to be so tried
- yet I believe it is quite right for some to enter this honourable
list, as I hope it will be for [underline]you[/underline]. - I wish none
of us may by any means have hurried this matter forward
before [underline]thou[/underline] thinks the right time, because thou
says "I am in some doubt of the propriety even of what
I have done," - I would like to know the "one reason."
now, my dear friend (for thou art so to me) to confess
the truth, were I to give way, these words would a little
hurt me: - to be sure prudence is an excellent thing, &
to be [underline]willing[/underline] [underline]to relinquish pleasing prospects[/underline] I doubt not
but right: - yet is it altogether wrong to be rather warm
in [underline]this cause[/underline]? see how much in love is that precious
young man J: Clibborn: do not immagine I doubt thy
23/8 mo. 1790.
The Retreat: Second-day.
I received thy letter nice & privately yesterday,
at

attachment for I believe thou [underline]art[/underline] attached to an object
well worthy of it, - a liberal soul she has, is clothed with
charity, - thinks badly of none hardly, & too well of many, I
do not class thee in this number. My mother has not said
much to me on the subject, - save that she intended to
speak to my father on the subject at a Edenderry meeting,
if she did not see him sooner, & that she thought it
best to leave those matters to the young-woman's choice,
& not bias her too much either way: - these are also my
father's sentiments I believe: - so that thou stands a good
chance [underline]in my opinion[/underline] of the object in question. - As
to its dropping without mother mentioning it to father, I
think it would look rather odd [underline]now[/underline], - [underline]yet[/underline] if thou
feels reluctance at it [underline]yet[/underline] being mentioned to father,
say so [underline]soon[/underline], & I shall speak to my mother. Now
if I have caused thee pain by what I have written,
I did not mean to do so, & wish thee to excuse me,
tis unpremeditated freedom. For my part I wish
it may prove quite right that you are to travel
together through this life, & I trust & hope it is:
Success to you in all good attempts saith my heart.
Does thou intend for Edenderry? - then pluck up courage,
& make what use thou pleases of thy sincerely
affectionate sympathizing friend.
S: Shackleton.

For Wm. Leadbeater.
