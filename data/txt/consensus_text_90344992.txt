11th.. month.
13th.. Well after all my waiting
they did not come which
was quite a disappointment -
[unclear]Ned[/unclear] came out to dinner
this day is just as wet.- it really
is astonishing the quantity of rain
that has fallen this week -
After tea - They came out to tea, Blly
Papa & H - so at last they have come -
It was delightful to see Polly again -
We had a great chat after tea : Philips
cold is not quite well yet -.
14th.. First day but as it looked so wet
and the carriage had only the night
before come all the way from town Papa
thought it better not to [unclear]mind[/unclear] going
to meeting - as it seemed to clear a
little he, Polly and I set off with strong
boots and umbrellas to look at the flood
in our river, but almost before
we set out, it began to rain, and
with the exception of a few minutes
it did not cease the whole time
we were out - coming home by
the brows, it poured & only for our
umbrellas we would have been wet
through I think - After all the river was
not nearly so much flooded as we
expected - at one time our eyes were
treated with a gleam of sunshine
which guilded one of the mountains
& some blue sky
[insertion]& some blue sky[/insertion] but it was only transient for soon
blue sky & sunshine vanished and
all was dreary clouds again - On
our return we were obliged to
change our clothes we were
so wet and did not venture
out again. After tea for a wond[unclear]er[/unclear]
