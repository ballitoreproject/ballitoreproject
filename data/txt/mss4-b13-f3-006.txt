Raw's, the friend who travel'd some
time with Mary Watson & Mary [unclear]Steery[/unclear]
we did not know he resided here, or
that it was to his house we were coming
Our agreeable friend John Applegarth,
& Kenneth Mackever accompanied us hither.
3d.. First-day. To meeting, & tho' it
was expected several would attend from
other small meetings, which is their manner,
to hold one preparative meeting collectively,
previous to the mo: meetg.. preceding
the Qly: Meetg.. yet very few came.
It was a trying time, it being evident
things of the greatest importance are
at a low ebb. I thought John Applegarth
proved [underline]this[/underline] day, that he was a feeling,
concerned, upright member, 4th.. To meeting
to Leyburn, 10 miles, Thos.. Lambert & Michel
Fryer guides. Another trying day, [unclear]cold[/unclear]
within & cold without. After dining at
Richd.. Thompson's, he with Thos.. Lambert
accompanied us to Ays-garth, 8 miles,
Lodg'd at Christopher Thompson's.
