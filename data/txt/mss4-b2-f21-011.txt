Holyhead 4th 6th Month 1769
Dear Friend,
I Arivd here last night but Too late to get my horse Shipd on board the Packet that Saild This morning & not being Easy to leave so good a Creature (that has Carried me ^well^ about Thirteen hundred Miles sence I Left Dungannon) behind me, am now Expereiscing that Excelent Virtue Patience in hopes of sailing for Dublin Tomorrow morning
	I [crossed out] Just Returd from taking a Walk alone by the sea side where Thou & I spent some time several years agoe & Recolecting that my Friend often Estimates a few Lines from a Friend at more than the Intrinsic Value, ^thought^ That I would sit down & Write Thee what might Come to hand,
	Its now more than Three months that I have been Ingaged in Visiting the Churches in the north of England & and divers other Parts As I found my mind drawn & I hope may say have discharged my self of the Required Service honnestly, & according to the best of my understanding & ability Receivd, nor can I accuse my self of neglect or Omition to any Individual, and notwithstanding the Labour allotted was in many places such as made me feeling^ly^ to say in my heart, who is sufficiant for This work, yet may I Ever Remember with Humbleing thankfullness that sufficiant to the day has been that strength which my mind have Witnessed The Everlasting Father of the family is not a hard master But a Rich New order of all who Love and follow Him, my Soul has renewed Cause to adore This Goodness; may Every of His mercy, and in a Perticular manner that Preservation which he Has Vouchd Safe to attend Hitherto, & that Sweet Peace which I have felt, & now feel, more & more Humble and bow all thats within me to the bringing into Captivity Every Thought to the Obediance of the Price of Peace, 
	I Know Thy Inquiring Mind, will wish to be Informd how I felt the state of the Churches as I passed Along, & seem free to Inform in Part
	There is a Seed, a Living favourd Seed, in most places; some few Fathers; some few Young Men; & I Trust divers Little Children; in whose hearts the Heavenly Fathers fear is Witnessed as a fountain of Life, But My Friend, as in our Land, a state of supineness has overtaken Many; & Deep Sleep Closed the Eyes of others, nor hath all those who have been Called to to be Princes & Rulers Amongst the Tribes of our Israel escaped the Latter I would I could say that all upon whom the Anointing Oyle has been powered has so dwelt in the House of God, as to be Qualified to feed the flock with Heart felt Truths, but alass Even divers of there are superficial; in this nation & I fear Throughout the Coasts of Israel; To ^begin in the spirit &^ Run well for a Time, I perceive, has been Too Generaly Esteemed a great thing, and that the succeeding Pages of Life Required not the same Watchfull humble steping as those of Infants Espousall, that however such may have Learnd Christ my fears Increase with my Experiance, and I this day find as Much Occation for humble Watchfullness as in that of Early Covenant; May the God of my Life and Salvation, Preserve me safe over this [over text, in pencil] Lea/A [original text below crossed out] sea [illegible] of Glass, which to me is yet mingled with fire, & so Establish my goings, that I may be Qualified in some degree to speak well of his mighty name who alone is Worthy both now & for Ever
	Amongst the many painfull feelings that attended the Course of my Visit that of a Light Easy moved, [illegible due to rip]ial ministry was not the least, but Rather the [obscured beneath fold] most distressing, These are according to my feeling Too mu[under fold] and must be Reduced before, the sword of the Lord & of Gide Can be Published to the Subdueing of that which opresses Israel, & have Wished with all my heart that Even the Covering Cherubs, ware wholy free from somewhat of an over Active disposition, but Let me not smite my fellow servants who have been in Christ long before me, & whom I Love & to whom I Trust I have been honnest in Publick & Private, but this I think I see, that the day hastens and is nigh, in which the Churches will be more Weaned & Redeemd in this Matter, & more deeply settled under the teachings of the minister of the Sanctuary; nor Could I Refrain divers time looking towards the Land of our Nativity with This address; Hail favoured Island, who altho much stripd of usefull Labourers, yet art Profitably freed from the oppressive burthen of a multiplicity of traders in unfelt Truths, and Indeed according to my feelings the Children of Ireland have abundant Cause to be Humbly thankfull to the God of all Grace in this as well as divers other Respects,

Farewell Dear Richard, if This gets to hand Thou may conclude I am safe arivd at Dublin where if shou[cut off] Arive Tomorrow or timely on thirday morning I purpose siting the meeting that day & then proceed homeward, my Dear Love to Betty Thy father &c I would have Esteemd his Compa^n^y to Northampton Lester Notingha[cut off] Sheffield Stopport & Liverpoole where had meetings since I left London but Could not have that favor I am poorly in health having had a bad Colic & now a hoarsness & Cold

I Remain Affectionately Thine
