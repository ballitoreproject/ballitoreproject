My dear E
I wonder what thou
art doing for Margt
now - I hope she is
not [underline]too[/underline] troublesome
to thee, I feel quite
glad that I did not
run the risk of bringing
her home while she
seem'd so delicate
has another tooth made
its appearance I hope
soon to hear of her
complaint which is very prevalent
here & which I believe Johnny has
taken he has no tooth yet ---
John & the girls have not return'd
yet their last letter was from
Edinburgh, they spoke of turning
homewards when they should have
seen that interesting City thy SB
is [unclear][/unclear] White going to the North?
to [unclear][/unclear] by Nancy
[unclear][/unclear] left 1 pr of stockings
& some thing else which I forget
at the Post Office she would be
obliged to anty to send them

E Gough express'd much
gratitude for thy kind
& thoughtful remembrance
of her - she has this evening
heard that the Provincial
School in Waterford is
in want of a Superintendent
& has written to S Ridgeway
to enquire into the duties
of such a situation & whether
she would be encouraged
to apply for it - didst
thy hear [deletion][/deletion] that Mary Anne
Boardman's prettiest daughter
I think her name is Hannah,
is going to wed Simon
Max of Waterford?
I'm told he is to [unclear][/unclear]
Â£300 per ann on her, I [unclear]suppose[/unclear]
this was the great
inducement - I call'd
at F Johnson's this evening
to enquire for Debby
& found that she had
gone to Claremont to
spend a few days she
had been very poorly with
the tooth ake & had two
teeth down - When
is Hannah White to come
home? I saw R [unclear]Benton[/unclear]
this evening she says
the children have been
[unclear][/unclear] with a bowel
