Translation of an advertisement published in the French newspaper
at Paris: Taken from Lloyd's evening post of 9th.. of 3rd.. mo: 1785.
Paris: February 24th.. 1785. The principles of peace and quietness,
which characterize the society of Quakers, forbids them from taking
any part in wars and do [deletion]es[/deletion] not [insertion]even[/insertion] suffer them to partake of any profits which
may arise from such a source. One of these peaceable people was inevitably
concerned in some privateers, which his partners would fit
 out during the late war, notwithstanding all his remonstrances
& opposition, & having received his share of the profits, has sent his
son to this City, to endeavour to find out the owners of the vessels
taken by the above letters of marque, & restore to them the part he has
received of those prizes: for which purpose he has publish'd the names of all
the vessels taken by the Privateers fitted out by his father's house, & desires
the owners or their Agents to apply to Doctor Edward Long Fox
Hotel de York, Rue Jacob, a Paris.
Which appears to have occasioned a letter to Dr.. E: L: Fox, of
which the following is a translation, viz.
Nismes: 1 April 1785.
The Quakers of Congenies Calviston
To the virtuous Fox.
Friend Fox,
The testimony which thou hast born[deletion]e[/deletion] to France
of thy inviolable attachment to the true principles of Christ, & of thy
humane & pacific disposition, which has inclined thee to do
good to thy enemies, has caused the hearts of the brethren to
leap to for joy, who are thy friends although sequester'd from
the world, & 150 leagues distant from thee. We are a little
flock of about 100 persons who being raised to the divine
life by our faithful obedience to the holy spirit are united
in heart & brotherly love: & I am commissioned by them to inform
thee how much thy proceedings have tendered our hearts, & what
esteem & affection we have felt for thee. It is not worldly praise
that we offer thee; for thou hast done no more than obey the
voice of the light within: thy reward is in thy own breast. Those
who live after the flesh admire thee, & wonder at a measure, of
which they find themselves incapable. But as for us, whose
principles are the same with thine, & who practise spiritual worship
only - Our minds are all united in approbation of the eminent
 act of humanity which thou hast lately performed, in fulfilling

this divine precept of Christ, "If thy enemy hunger, feed him, &
if he thirst, give him drink - & revenge not yourselves". Although thy
countrymen were the enemies of France, thou & all thy friends called
in derision Quakers have always regarded us as Brethren, & have always
been in remembrance in our prayers & breathings. The same good spirit
which has conducted thee into our country has penetrated our hearts
& has excited us afresh to all the good works, of which thou hast solately
set us an example. Proceed, dear friend, with undaunted courage
& incorruptible zeal, to accomplish the good work, which thou
hast begun. Let not the numberless voices of a corrupt Metropolis
taint the purity of thy faith may'st thou escape victoriously
all the snares which many will Cary for thy integrity: consider
that in the midst of a depraved multitude, who narrowly
scrutinize all thy actions, with a design to invalidate that eminent
principle which gave birth to thy good deeds, & to cast a
shade on their lustre, which has dazzled the eyes of mankind;
thou canst do nothing unseen by the Supreme Being, & that as
thy actions will undergo the close investigation of slander, they
will impress beholders with profound respect as sovereign contempt
for our religious principles. Perhaps our friend Fox will charge
us with presumption for pretending to exhort him in this manner,
without knowing him; but our minds which are united to thee
are impressed with an apprehension of duty, & we render implicit
obedience to the call, as a sincere testimony of our este[insertion]e[/insertion]m & most
tender affection. Thou bearest, dear friend Fox, the name of one of
 our venerable founders, as dear to our hearts as that of Wm.. Penn
& we all hope that the spirit which enlightened his soul will
always direct thy conduct so as to render thee still more respectable
to all men. Thy first testimony has contributed
much to strengthen the resolution and the Faith of our
peaceable society; & in the first effusion of our minds we unite
in a desire to testify to thee the sincere affection thou hast inspired
us with, & the love which thou hast been the means of renewing
for all our brethren, amongst whom thou wilt always
hold a distinguish'd rank. Condescend, dear friend,
us whatever relates to thy happiness, in which we shall always

 be most affectionately interested. Although we are [insertion]here[/insertion] the object of hatred
and contempt, both of Catholics & Protestants, we rejoice in being hated,
& despised for the sake of the name of Christ, who foretold such
things. Mat. X. We answer their reproaches only with blessings & acts of
kindness, & we give thanks continually for the happy toleration,
which (through the clemency of a virtuous Prince & the kindness of
his ministers) hath been long since vouchsafed to us. We trust that
our ready submission to the commands of our sovereign, & our respectful conduct
towards those whom he hath set over his people, the love we bear
our brethren, & the peaceable principles, which make us condemn War as
the wrath of Tigers & Lions, & the revolt of the ancient Protestants
as abominable rebellion against the divine will, the principles of
Christ & that obedience which we have always faithfully rendered
to the sovereigns appointed us by God - We trust that these
considerations will in due season incline this beneficent Father
of his people to look with an eye of pity & indulgence on his submissiv[insertion]e[/insertion]
children, who love & revere him, & will induce him to desist from forcing
the little flock of Quakers, who live under his government, to wound
their consciences in drawing lots to bear arms, which we are so expressly forbidden
ever to use. "Do good to thy enemy, & resist not him that sticketh
"thee." Mat. 5th.....39th...
O worthy friend, who hast just fulfilled this divine precept, receive
favourably this testimony of our love and joy, as the emotions of
true & sincere hearts, desirous to do likewise, & making daily efforts to imitate
thee - All our friends embrace thee, & ardently desire the pleasure
of hearing from thee, which they request of thee as a token of
sincere friendship - If thou thinkest us worthy of an answer direct
it to M. Massolier Junr- Surgeon at the post-office in Nismes.
We wish thee peace & happiness.
