Mt. mellick 21 of 3 mo: 1789.
I may acquaint my friend that I think there are
some girls in this school that might answer as an assistant
to Hannah Haughton, in the Shop, &c. as Mary Thornton,
Sarah Shilly, Elizabeth or Anne Valentine: Elizabeth
seems the best qualified, & the most likely to answer, as
she has a desire to go to some such place: I spoke to her
of going to assist in a Shop, but did not tell her where,
she seemed rejoiced at it, for, I suppose, the prospect at
her fathers is very discouraging; so that it might be of
great advantage to the girl to get such a place, with
such a person as H. Haughton; but then the question is,
would her mother give her up? If not probably she would
Anne, who I think is next to her, they seem to be well disposed
children, & of pretty good abilities - I thought to have
seen more of your family at the Province Meeting than thy
father - I may say I was glad I was at it - for any farther
particulars I refer thee to thy father, who can [underline]far[/underline] better
inform thee than I can - I expect to [insertion]be[/insertion] at the Half year's
meeting, as Jacob Martin seems to decline going - farewell
Wm. Leadbeater
