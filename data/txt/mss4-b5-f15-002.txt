As my dear Mary Shackleton is so
very desirous of hearing from me soon, it would have too
much the appearance of ingratitude if I omited so good an
oppertunity of returning her my sencerest acknowledgment
for such an acceptable mark of her continued regard. tho'
I must confess from her silence, I began to conclude
that my last letter had not met with so welcome a reception
or that thy more agreeable engagement, had banished
D Birkbeck from thy remembrance. that when thy
obliging favor arrived it was productive of real pleasure
to find my suppositions were groundless, indeed I was
glad to find, they were only imaginary, as I should have
been sorry to have lost a corrispondant, that I am certain
not only to derive amusement, but instruction, therefrom
that would not have been a pity, from any
fault of mine, to have deprived myself of that satisfaction

My dear Mary requests I will give her some account
of my journey to the Metropolis, & as a plain proof that
I am fond of the South, I am not yet returned. No now
my Eyes have beheld such [/underline]great[/underline] and [underline]grand scenes[/underline]. I don't
know whether I can be reconciled to going to poor Settle
again. tho' I suppose in a few months I must, that
for my own peace I shall endeavor to be content.
I have not yet seen all the fine things which are
to be seen. but I have seen the King & Queen. which some
say is a feather in my Cap. however I was pleased with
the sight. for I thought they appeared delighted with each
others company. indeed I do believe the King is a very good
Domestic Man, and in my humble opinion, an excellent
example to his subjects. their would be many more happy
Marriages, then their are, if they would [insertion]but[/insertion] imitate so good a
sovereign, which character he has always had & I trust
deservedly, then is it not strange that it is not fashionable
to copy such a father, & if that was the case, their is no
doubt with me but it would be followed.
Undoubtedly thou hast [deletion]had[/deletion][insertion]heard[/insertion] the particular relative
to the yearly Meeting long ago, from those that are much

better qualified for to give thee that information, then
I am, or I would give thee that intelligence with the
greatest pleasure, tho' I painfully know that would be a
task, that with my pen, I should be very inadequate too
Please to give my very dear love to thy Aunt & Cousin
Fullen, I was greatly disapointed in not going to meet
them all Berkly Steven. yet it was a greater disapointment
that they did not make it convenient to return with my
Brother, for I had flattered myself I was certain of
enjoying the satisfaction of their company at Settle
I could not have believed they would have come so very
[underline]near[/underline]Yorkshire, without conferring upon me that favorition
yet I readily excuse them, because I hope their [unclear][/unclear]
paying us a visit, did not proceed from want of [unclear]i[/unclear]
Please to give my very dear love to thy Father M [unclear][/unclear] Pleasure
Brother & Sister. and do be so kind as to excuse all errors
for I am in haste, yet believe me to be with the
sincerest affection. thy obliged
friend
