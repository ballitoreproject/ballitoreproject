London, 22nd of Eighth month, 1795
My dear Friends, A.S. & M.L
The joint salutations of my two beloved friends, and the joyful
tidings of an awful event taking place in so favourable a manner,
called forth emotions of satisfaction & gratitude wch
prompted to an immediate acknowledgment of the welcome
intelligence but being, as it seemed, unavoidably prevented
writing yesterday, when the letter arrived, I was obliged to
restrain the expression of my feelings during another
duirnal revolution. My Mother, Sisters Elizabeth & Hannah &
my Brother John, also feel much satisfaction on the occasion,
and take kind your affectionate remembrance of them. We
hope to be indulged with repeated accounts of this young
stranger & her Mother, as there always appears room for
solicitude for a few weeks, although I am quite disposed
to expect a continuance of good reports.
As you both addressed me [insertion]on[/insertion] one spect, and I was before
according to common acceptation of the terms, indebted to
my friend A. S. I seem most inclined to give you both
equal shares, in whatever reply the little [deletion]leisure[/deletion] time
now within my grasp for such a purpose may admit.
In the present situation of our family I am necessarily
much engaged, and our beloved Elizabeth being [insertion]about[/insertion] to leave
London tomorrow evening, makes it still more difficult
to detach oneself from other occupation. But I would
be clearly [deletion]to[/deletion] understood that I do not pretend to such
over nicety, as to sample paying single postage for the
letter received yesterday if he who sent it did, he might
have written double on the outside: though I believe I should

should have thought it more [underline]nice [/underline]than[underline] wise[/underline], or even true.
I know [insertion]not[/insertion] how it comes to be supposed that Londoners are so exact
a few individuals may, but there is such variety amongst us,
that I know not one characteristic feature which can be
generally assigned us. I almost suspect that this notion must
have been imbibed from examining some communications
of an extraordinary man, J.G.B- who is so very particular
in some things and so prone to adopt uncommon sentiments,
that though a truly valuable character few even of his fellow
citizens can fully unite with or understand him. Yet he is
I believe very useful in many matters, honestly desirous, above
most, to do whatever he thinks right, and I should be grieved
to infuse the least hint disadvantageous to him. I only wished
to give a caution, which might possibly present the peculiarities
of one inhabitant from being [insertion]unjustly[/insertion] ascribed to the soil upon which,
he has been reared the supplement [insertion]to dear Mary's letter[/insertion] was however, very pleasant
and more within the scale of my comprehension than [deletion]the[/deletion] two
preceding communications, the latter of which has hitherto escape
reply, and probably a reply to it must be excused, for now there
seems no time or open to attempt it. One remark I just
wish to make --- to request no more words filled up with
[underline]blanks[/underline] may be sent me as I much disapprove the practice
something in my recoiled at the sight - surely we write nothing
we are ashamed of -- then what occasion for disguise? and
if there were could not any one who had ever heard of
the [deletion]words[/deletion] [insertion]names[/insertion], find them out through so thin a vail? I [deletion]also[/deletion]
think that my endeared friend has a better opinion of some of those
reformers heart's than they deserve: I look upon several of them
rather as scourges than lights: -- or perhaps as reckors, affording
[insertion]a[/insertion] deceitful glare, and foreboding dreadful storms. I have lately taken more

more in the way of hearing, than before, and have reason to conclude
that Godwins books in as thou expected it would be, a [insertion]too[/insertion] powerful
engine to remain inactive It seems to have nearly laid waste
every thing [insertion]precious[/insertion] in a considerable number of young minds predisposed
to endure its operation fully. one hopeful plant, particularly
is apprehended to be in a deplorable situation from which some
doubt his ever recovering what I heard of him affected me much
believing [insertion]that[/insertion] my own feelings whilst reading the book, and afterwords
enabled me, to in some degree to sympathize with him. But
I think there is more [insertion]hope[/insertion] of him, who feels his loss, than of thou
who [underline]rejoice[/underline] in their skeptical advancement finding no want of
anything better than themselves, and there seems to be a numerous
band of Godwin's disciples in this latter circumstance.
Perhaps I may also venture to express some uneasiness upon a
[insertion]of each[/insertion] of the two last letter respecting "new" & "old heavens". Though
individuals may have formed likenesses to themselves, yet
There appears good reason to conclude that the sensible part of our religious
community has not of any time, since we were a people,
trusted in aught but enduring substance. So that to suppose
even [deletion]part[/deletion] [insertion]some[/insertion] of that heaven in which [underline]our[/underline] fathers trusted [insertion]in[/insertion] must
be shaken seems little less than looking for [underline]"another gospel"[/underline]
degeneracy & weakness have [insertion]lamentably[/insertion] prevailed so as almost to [unclear]pre[/unclear]
The brightness of our sun; yet his light & invigoration warmth are
undiminished and may yet, when purifying storms have done
their office, again shine forth upon his heritage. In the noontime
it may be well for those who see what is amiss to be careful
how they meddle without dear understanding of their individual
allotment; else some kinds of work may be overdone & others
neglected. It is also of consequences to avoid involving right thing with
wrong [deletion]in one compare[/deletion] though the Church of Saids was so far departed
from a state of purely, she had this charge. "Be Watchful & strengthen the

"the things which remain." I am inclined to hope that there is really
some [underline]revival[/underline] in our society though the first paragraph [insertion]in our Epistle[/insertion] makes so much
of it as almost to grieve some of us and this persuasion encourages
[insertion]some[/insertion] even of the little children to step forth at the apprehended mandate of [deletion]the[/deletion]
a gracious Master. Did not a hope of this kind strengthen to write in labour
with his brethren on the late occasion mentions in your letter? I rejoiced
to hear of that engagement believing such are often blessed to visitors
& visited, even in much desolated quarters and that they eminently
tend to unite those so employed. - We are much concerned at S. Grubb's
accident, dislocations of the shoulder have proved formidable in several late instances
here; they seem to have lost or not to have, the right art of replacing.

you do not mention your mother, Lydia or any but M. & S. at Ballitore
neither whether Wm & Mary are yet moved to their new house I sent the latter
a few lines lately by private hand, with two small traces by her - Shading, what
I hope she will soon receive. My Father attends but little on the whole save
that he grows thinner and rather more clouded in his faculty. My mother more
complaining & depressed in spirit. Sister Hanna pretty well - We all love you. Better
going is rather trying, yet I seem easy about it. She is a sister indeed and I believe her presence
send hitherto a particular favour to me. I am now [underline]quite[/underline] reconciled to her departure
which was not the case till this week. I feel it difficult to say how I am circumstanced;
yet from you, my beloved friends, who have convinced so tender an interest in my welfare
it seems ungrateful to conceal it after a long season of oppression some conflict and various
doubtings respecting the cause (trials which the situation of our family served pretty well

to cover it seemed clear that publick exposure was the prescribed
way of deliverance: some unwise hesitation encreased
the burden till it felt almost to heavy to bear, when in great
condescension strengthen was afforded for a small offering in
in our meeting on fourth-day. Monthly meetg succeeded, which
was got through pretty satisfactory though the office of Clark
required activity not desirable at such a time the Peaceful
feelings which succeeded demand grateful commemoration; except
is our awful situation & claims the care of friends. Do you see honest
with me my endeared friends! -- Farewell
