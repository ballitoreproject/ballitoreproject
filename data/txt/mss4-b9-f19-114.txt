Dublin 14th of 8th mo 1826
My dear E
We arrived here safe & sound after an
agreeable journey Willie was quite quiet the
whole way & suck'd his bottle occasionally
we put Magt. into the [unclear]coach[/unclear] at Naas
she soon fell asleep there & so pass'd
some of the time we had but one shower
& were so well defended from it by George's
coat & umbrella that we got not wet,
I have just been at M Chambers's & saw her
in bed she suffers great pain at times
from her back with weariness but says she
does not mind the pain of her leg much
She is very patient & cheerful Betsy has
written particulars to Mary, I hear Johnny
is very well & intend to go see him tomorrow

S Boardman is married John had a
letter from E Gough while I was in Ballitore
she is not so sanguine as usual about
this place so that we hope she will stay
in it I gave Betsy Eben's letter thou
may tell him so if he should ask
[unclear][/unclear] to tell my aunt Lydia & Mary
please to tell my aunt Lydia & Mary
that we got home safe, I would not send
this by post if I were not afraid thou
would be uneasy about us Margt seems
tired, with dear love to all I bid farewel
thy SB
Bety sleeps in the room with M C
as she wants a good deal of attention in
the night she is overflowing with gratitude,
she met great kindness even from
total strangers
