Ballitore: 12/2 mo: 1824
My dear Betsy
I have a faint hope of a frank - an object to which my eyes of late have
been much a stranger, & in that hope I would fain scribble a few lines of
inquiry about you, who "though lost to sight", are "to memory dear". Thy letter to
Margt Harvey was very delightful to us. We seemed to behold darling John Pim -
Oh let me never forget that evening at the Mill. We were supposing thee at Jo [unclear]Morton[/unclear]
pleasant Tottenham, & kind Hannah Pim who I hope got my letter sent to Joseph
Harvey for her. I have heard from him of my MS having wached him. I mentioned
Harvey for her. I have heard from him of my MS having reached him. I mentioned
thee to him for I think he is an open-hearted man - & I mentioned[underline] a collection of [unclear][/unclear][/underline]
to which some able hands had contributed - I enquired would he print them. If
he mentions them to thee, never fear, for I gave him no [underline]hints[/underline] who wrote them
I very lately copied "on the difficulty of doing good" - & was much delighted with it.
the poor man with the old shoes thou has with thee I believe - & sure my nameless correspondent
might extend his or her travels to London. "The hour of my departure
"draws nigh" - & I whose [deletion]longest[/deletion] most distant excursion is to the Meeting - hence must
prepare for a formidable journey, & on a formidable occasion. W:L: regrets much
my going - poor Darby & Joan to be separated. It has been a dull winter - & my spirit
has been often sad. Ah! my dear, regretted Sister, whom I must never see again in this
world - but my own days, not a few, are hastening to their termination. Aged Jonathan
Pim has lately departed from this life. Anne Beale & Anne Thacker preparing for
their nuptials, & Deby[deletion][/deletion] Fayle, Gretter's only daughter has made a clandestine
match. Mary Anne Rowe (alias Fitzsimmons) is now an inmate at Willow-brook

son called here yesterday, his person & manners are very graceful, & he seems a modest,
sensible youth. He gives little expectation that his Mother can return to Naroughmore.

received the account of his death on sea near Genoa.
10th Thy dear letter from Tottenham came. Ah! I well remember Tottenham
I expect soon to set out for Limerick, & am in an unsettled state. So am
going to copy out Miss Fanny Flettu 
21st My day is fixed in 24th P. Fitzsimmons comes with me. Why am I
so disposed to be agitated on this occasion? I believe it is the last long journey
I shall take in this world. Charles Burton & Hercules Campbell dined with us
to-day, & formed a striking contrast. CBurton looks thin, & his health delicate
he talked much of old times & of Debh's ride before him from the Wood.

Richmond: 2/3 month. The morning of 24th arrived - all was ready. I had
not had slept very soundly- but had endeavoured to compose my spirits - when,
A. Fitzsimmons entered with a letter which he had just received informing him of
his son John's illness. Upon which we gave up the hopes of his accompanying me
& it seemed agreed that I should be put in case of some passenger whom we might
know. This was a climax - & yet, strangely it felt to me - instead of being more disturbed
I become more calm - when the blessed words "I will go with thee myself,"
if using from my WL's mouth dispelled any impending cloud. Kind Puxley returned
to say he would go with me, & go from Clonmel to Dublin next day - No-
no - we could appreciate the feelings of a father, & such a father, & I remembered my
anxiety about Eben when I was in Mountmelick too well to permit us to detain
His wife & two fine little girls called afterwards to see us.

him an hour from his child, whom he found better. I know now what ailed him,
beside the deep grief his sister's misconduct caused him. WL went outside as far
as Kilkenny. I was put in to Jane Gatehill, her son Edwd, one of Isaac Simmons's
daughters, a gentleman who greatly disapproved of friends deviating from their principles
in dress & address, & a comely Waterford woman. The Gatehills were going to
Thomas's presentation I believe. We lost all these at Kilkenny, where WL took an [unclear][/unclear]
seat, & we had agreeable company enough (tho' one was a dog) to Clonmel where we
arrived about eleven at night, & were met by Robert Grubb with his car. For Anna, when
she brought Saml back to school, & returned with him next night, fortunately came to us -
I say fortunately because of the Scarletina being at the Mill, & polite little Samuel said to
the same effect because his mother had engaged me to them. I need say nothing of the
cordial, easy politeness of sweet Anna. Next day we spent with Sister Grubb in her new
abode abode a pleasant airy one with sister Sally, not long returned from Myrtle-hill. Sister
G. seemed finely & was part of the day gay & cheery- other part not quite so well. Her
change of abode seems generally approved of. We breakfasted fifth-day at Abraham's
with the "happy, happy, happy pair", & after meeting WL & I went in Abraham's car to
Anner Mills, where I recognized the objects well remembered, especially the Tulip-tree
which at sixty years of age perhaps, is now coming into blow. But the family, so good
so happy, so cultivated & so humble do not
We took tea at the school, & admired the beautiful penmanship & neat plain work
of the girls, saw Sally Wright, Hannah Waring, Susa Todhunter &c, &c. There are 33 girls
We paid several call-in-visits- one of the first to our ever dear Betsy Grubb, who seems relapsing
into lowness again - nor did we forget poor Wrightson's grave. On 6th day we
took the Limerick coach - a gentleman was with us, who on perceiving the ticket on my
basket introduced himself to us, telling us he was Sam Phelps. He was pleasant & chatty
but not a friend by any means - & I only remembered that he used to tease Mary Shackleton
We exchanged him at Cahir for an intelligent Scotchman, who spoke very sensibly on the
state of the Poor, & imputes their misery to the landlords. As we drew near the city WL
often popped out his head to look for the Shannon, which did not shew itself till we saw
the beautiful City worthy to adorn the banks of that noble river. Thou may judge
"The dews of Heaven fall thick in blessings on them?"

how delightful Lydia was, especially to see her father. I need say nothing of Richmond
nor of the dear, old woman who is loving to me. Nor of Summerville, where Joseph is
recovering, & Rebecca delightful, & where we dined on 1st day with Ruben from Cork just
come from Mountmelick where Isaac Jacob & Anne Beale had a "noble wedding" the 25th
Joseph & his wife, Thomas Mark, Edwd Dason thy poet Ges Fennel - In short there was
a long table full of us. Joseph M.H. sitting in the drawing-room, not yet dining in
company. Surely you have heard of the bleeding of the lungs with which he was attacked
some time ago, & which his doctors said might prevent an apoplectic seizure. Reuben
& Hannah Harvey came to see me yesterday. I forgot all I had been displeased with in
Hannah (even my [underline]too local[/underline] verses) knowing as I do her sisterly kindness to Lydia, & receiving
such a cordial greeting from her myself. After meeting 1st day, several friends
introduced themselves to me. Oh Time, thou marrer of pretty faces! Mary Hill who
accompanied her newly-wedded sister Debby Unthank to Cork in 1780, was then a handsome,
& I thought a tall woman - alas, she is neither now (except a benevolent countenance)
& Debby Unthank, who I thought was neither then, seems quite improved in beauty & stature.
Wm McAllister & I held a chat in the meeting house before friends assembled. This
morning my dear Wm has left me. Was it not exceedingly kind of him to leave all his
business to wait upon me, & of Elizabeth to undertake every thing in our absence?
Lydia is well in health & spirits, but very large - a most prominent personage. Sally
as pretty as ever. Dear Thomas about to take his departure. How glad will you be
to see his dear, well-known face! I suppose they have heard from you since we left Ballitore
but no tidings have reached us from you. And we grow very anxious when we are a
little while in suspense about you. I should say that Wm went to Clairville yesterday, the
weather was fine & he admired the country & the bleaching-works which appear likely to
succeed, & great exertions are making here to benefit the Poor. Charitable loans & clothing
both paid by installments, are likely to do much good. One woman thought herself wealthy
when she was lent a crown to extend her huckstery business, having set upon [underline]Ten [/underline]
[underline]pence[/underline]. Lydia is greatly beloved here, & I hope endeavours to deserve it. Nelly Whelan
who lived with thy mother, my mother & myself is I suppose now with Anna Grubb in Clonmel.
I wish our export may prove a [insertion][underline]profitable[/underline][/insertion] valuable one.
