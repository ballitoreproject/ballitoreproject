My dearest Mama
As Aunt Eliza is
writing to Grandmama I send
these few lines in it to thee as I have
no other way of sending them, I wrote
to thee on Saturday last: I hope thee
got it safe, on Sunday Aunt Eliza
and I went to see the Champ de
Mars, came home to four oClock
dinner and spent the rest of the
evening at home, Uncle Thomas
was not with us as I told you

in my last he was not very well
This is the only morning since
that he got up to breakfast, every
other he did not get up till late
on Monday Aunt Eliza and I
went to see Val de Grace and
the Observatoire, we came
home by the Luxemburg Gardens
Tuesday we did not do much
Wednesday Uncle Thomas came
with us to the Gobelin Tapistry
there are some very nice peices
there and we saw them at work
at it also, while we were there
we met Tom Pin and his wife
his brother and his brother's son
they are paying a visit to Paris as
well as ourselves, yesterday we
went again to the Louvre to
show Uncle Thomas the sculptures
we also saw others which we
did not see before, we expect
to see Uncle Arthur and Willy before
long perhaps this evening or tomorrow
they are in London and intend
coming here for a few days, Please
excuse this short letter I have
no news why don't you write?

if you don't like to pay the postage
send it to Aunt Martha & she can
send it in one of hers to Aunt Eliza
I dont know when we shall
leave this as Uncle Thomas is
waiting for a letter from Dr.
Henry, may be we shall be [deletion][/deletion]
another week here, Uncle Thomas
is waiting for this Give my love
to all from thy affectionate
Daughter Emily
