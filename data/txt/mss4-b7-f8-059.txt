Waterford 12 April
My dear Cousin
The critical situation of our dear
relative gave me much concern: however the latter
part of your favour excited hopes of her
convalescence. I should be pleased to learn of her
complete recovery. Since my former communication
of the names of Subscribers I have got
the addition of four which I now apprehend
are too late for insertion in the list
John Harris
Waterford
Wm Waterhouse
Anna Daniell Clemmel
James Daniell Mayfield Mills
I suppose the Stationers in Dublin are not
at at loss to know the best conveyance to
Waterford - The package may be directed to
Wm.. Rayner
Waterford: 12/4 mo. 1800
Ansd.. 15/-

me at the Glass House the cheapest mode
of conveyance would be by sea if a vessel
offer for this part nearly loaden - but then there
would be the risque of the sea. - another mode
is by the canal which would be something
more expensive but less danger of loss
Wm Allen of Skinner row the Agent for the
Glass House can give information when a
boat is ready - The Carriers present the
last resource the most expensive & the least
dangerous. I wish to be affectionately
presented to Cousins Sally Lydia & the rest
of my friends.
I am
yours sincerely
William Rayner
