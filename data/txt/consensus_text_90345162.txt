went to the Exhibition with Jane [unclear]Richards[/unclear]
who came in to town with Aunt Martha

We met Aunt Liddy, Sally White and
Lizzie Coventry at the Exhibition; but
could not stay very long, as we
had to be home for three O'clock
dinner. Georgina left us after
dinner, so once more we were left
to ourselves. Papa went out this
evening. We have had some
conversation on a very interesting subject which
I shall mention some time soon I intend
