Ballitore: 29th of 6th month 1760.

Dear friend,

	+++ Home is the place in which we seem appointed by Providence, & the center of our duties; in which place, the home of our outward & inward habitation, if we were but favoured with Divine aid watchfully to keep, I believe we would ^[pencil] should^ hear the voice of wisdom, drawing us at times from our outward abodes, & to the exercise of duty in them. I am apt to think that thy keeping in a good degree to each home, has been of great service to thee in confirming & establishing thee in the right way, & opening & enlarging thy understanding in the nature & path of true religion, & also that it has gained this^ee^ respect & authority by reaching the witness in the breasts of some, even of those, who censure thee for the same. And what I would, in the freedom of a friend, advise to is, still more & more to keep to the inward home, & there to hearken & hear what the spirit saith, whether it calls thee forth in the enlargement of love to our fellow professors in society, to converse a little more freely with them, & endeavour to tincture their spirits with that leaven wherewith thy spirit has been tinctured also (as not only the loadstone attracts the iron, but the iron touched with its virtue attracts a lesser bit of iron likewise)Or whether the spirit whispers still to dwell as alone, & remain under the qualifying hand till the gifts & graces [page number] 17 wherewith the King furnishes & adorns his daughters are grown to that perfection & strength that they may be eminently serviceable in the cause & direction of the Great donor.
If thou goest this way to Cork, & if ^it be^ convenient to thee, I doubt not thy inclination to spend what time thou canst with us, & the kind of friendship which I have for thee makes any invitation needless. Whether thou goest or stayest I pray, in my heart, that the Divine hand which reached to thee, & stopped thee in the pursuit of thy own will, may still be with thee & upon thee, to protect & preserve thee from falling & ^or^ failing, & form & model thee into a conformity to the rectitude of the Divine Will. So wisheth & desireth
	thy sincere friend
