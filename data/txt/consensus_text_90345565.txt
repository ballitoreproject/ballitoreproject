Just as Ned and I were bidding
each other good night, who should
come to the door which was open
but the Doctor [underline][/underline] "Well! What's
but the Doctor - "Well! what's
the row now" said he in is
quiet low voice entering the room
at the same time and taking a
seat by the fire - "Well" ? said he
looking from Ned to me and me to
Ned - "Do you know the people will
have it here that you are husband
and wife, "they say you're only
shamming and that you're not
a bit like each other and you're so
attentive to him - "That's too funny"
said I laughing and Ned seemed
quite amused too -- "That's too funny
repeated he "oh well may be it wont
be too funny when you will really
be married now wouldn't you make
a nice little wife" added he laughing
I laughed too and bid him good
night whereupon [unclear][/unclear] he told me not
to be dreaming but to go to sleep
