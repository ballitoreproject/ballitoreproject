Griesebank 27th, of 9th mo. 1800
My dear aunt
My aunt Lydia just now asked me to write
to thee, thinking thou wouldst like to hear how
my mother gets on: well, be it known to thee
that she is recovering pretty quickly, and was
up to day and sitting in another room, Wm
[unclear]Lefanice[/unclear] came every day to see her, but this
as he was obliged to go to [unclear]Nhas[/unclear] to-day, however
he said if she were worse he would not go -
Can anything be kinder? He said she might
discontinue the Saline mixture, and still recommends
low living and quietness: she dined
yesterday on a wee bit of cauliflower without
butter, and a slice of bread - She is in good
spirits and chatty, Molly Webster took tea with
her last evening, and doubtless, amused her
not a little - I went to see her last night, and
found Molly telling a frightful story about a
stone that "broke her scull" when a child.
The measles have broken out in Wm. [unclear]Allments[/unclear]
family, so Lucy has not come yet - John Haughton
arrived at H. Haughton's yesterday, and is

there still, matters seem going on smack smooth
their union it is thought is likely to take place.
Mary came the evening you went, with Joseph
Houghton - I called in at Molly Haughton's yesterday
evening, but had not time to stay and hear
the affair discussed and settled - I suppose thou
hast heard the joyful intelligence of Hannah
White having got a tooth, she is better to-day
her grandmother says, than she was since it
appeared, and rested better last night, than usual -
My uncle, aunt, James & Lydia, Richard
Shakleton, Robert & Elly and myself, took tea
at S. Medlicott's on 1st. day evening, between
thou and I, there is too much state there, for
me to feel as easy as I could wish - Didn't
me to feel as easy as I could wish - Didst
thou sent the [underline]big sheet[/underline] off yet? - I hope Margaret
won't come home without a letter from
Jane Stephen to me, I shall be greatly disappointed
if she do - I went to Boakefield, on
1st. day, Thomas William's arm is going on very
well; she is very pretty and sweet tempered, his
mother says he has a great deal of sensibility
Now [underline]I[/underline] never heard of so young a child poss[insertion]ess[/insertion]ing
much, or indeed any, sensibility, but perhaps it
is common, what dost thou think about it

My cousin Jane Montgomery last 5th day morning
presented her husband with another son - I hear
both are likely to do well, but know not what the
babe is to called - My father and Ebenezer went
to Athy last 1st, day, and there met Dr Lecky
and his daughters; it seem, at least to me,
an odd place for them to be - If Mary Wyly and
Susanna Thacker be in town, I would be obliged
by thy giving my dear love to them and tell
Mary I would have written to her yesterday by
the beer-man only I thought she was from
home - I believe I may tell thee
she is my favourite of the two [unclear]might[/unclear]
My mother had an elegant letter from Mcless[unclear][/unclear]
Trench, the day thou left home, enclosing an
order for 5£, for the use of the Ballybarny
tenants, to be laid out as my mother thinks
best - Mary Casey is in great distress about James
he is gone to Spain, and she says she is [underline]sure[/underline] she
will never see him more, she had a letter from
his wife last 7th. day - Some of the boys went to Poula
Fouca today: 5 of what staid behind, are to spend
this evening here - My aunt bids me say she recieved
thine and Margaret's letter - farewell dearly
Elizth Leadbeater

I shou'd have endeavour'd to acknowledge thine & Margaret's very acceptable
letters particularly bit as Elizabeth is very useful [insertion]to me[/insertion] on every other occasion
I employ'd her to inform, thee of whatever has occur'd worth relating since
you left us - [underline]except that[/underline] I paid several visits this morning: sister M S look'd
much better than I have seen her since her illness - I sat a bit with Anna
as usual to my satisfaction; say John Haughton, & M D they look'd grave
& agreeable -Thou will oblige Abram by getting Thos Bewby or some other
person who understands it to purchase one oz of quicksilver for our barometer
LS
buy a [unclear][/unclear] [insertion]lancette[/insertion]
for my mother

My dear Aunt
My desires thou will buy her a
very small nice hearth brush as small as
those used for dusting. I wrote a letter to
thee, but as Elizabeth is sending this tonight
I wont send mine. AL write thine Dr Lo Margt
