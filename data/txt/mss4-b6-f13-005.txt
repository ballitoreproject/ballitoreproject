Fem: Orphan-House Dec. 4. 1818
Dear Madam
Before I advert to the painful
subject of your last letter, I must afford myself
the gratification of telling you, that I have had
much pleasure in perusing the 1st. part of your
Cottage Dialogues. I hope soon to meet with the
2d. part, & expect to find it equally calculated to
do extensive good in this Country, amongst the
Class of persons whose habits it so interestingly
& no doubt, accurately describes- I hope if ever
you
may [underline]appear[/underline] to one doubtless qualified in a much superior manner to
myself, but I can only offer what is in my power, and we all know that
the labours of the ablest [underline]human[/underline] Instrument, can be only [underline]effectual[/underline] in the
proportion that they are attended
with the [underline]Divine blessing[/underline]! So that
some may succeed in one way,
& some in another -
I will not exhaust more
of your time at present,
than to assure you
dear Madam,
of the sincere respect
of your oblig'd frd,
A Howeth

you come to Dublin [deletion][/deletion] you will afford me
the pleasure of seeing you shou'd I be here at that
time -----
I cannot describe to you how much I am grieved
by your account of Jane Murphy - I have understood
that she was, of most respectable family, her father
being a wine-merchant, & that she was under the
care of the then Bishop of Dublin, untill he found
an Asylum for her under this roof - of course one
cou'd not have suspected a [insertion]person[/insertion] so [underline]creditably[/underline] connected
to have so [underline]low[/underline] a prospensity as that of pilfering. She
was appointed my Chamber-servant, by my Predecessor
& as I scarcely ever have time to attend to my own
little wardrobe, any girl in that situation must have
PS. The Indentures left with our Secretary were doubtless signed
by J: Murphy. There is always one filed for the Institution

charge of my Clothes, & I must say that during the
many months which she serv'd me, I never was conscious
of missing a single article.
I really am at a loss to recommend how she shou'd
be dispos'd of: As your Apprentice, you are [underline]necessarily[/underline] responsible
for her conduct. She has violated a [underline]sacred[/underline] commandment,
& her Indentures justify your having recourse
to "due Correction" - Her eternal state may depend upon her
being judiciously treated [underline]now[/underline] - By whom cou'd she be
more judiciously treated than [insertion]by[/insertion] yourself? Justice wou'd not
admit of her being recommended to another family, without an
exposure of her fault - And if she were turn'd out upon the
world she might be for ever lost! - And how bitter wou'd [underline]your[/underline]
reflections be, if you had to feel that [underline]you[/underline] had been [underline]accessary[/underline]
to her ruin! You say she has forfeited her Indentures,
I do not possess sufficient legal knowledge to speak positively
but

but I apprehend you wou'd find some difficulty in disentangling
yourself from an Apprentice, who has only serv'd
about 13 months, out of 3 years. & you see by the Indentures,
you are [underline]bound[/underline] to [underline]maintain[/underline] her during the [underline]whole[/underline] term.

To
Mrs. Leadbeater
Ballitore
Laboriously as my time, & mind are occupied, & perfectly free
as I am from all charge of girls who have left this House, yet
out of real respect for your character, & pity for the wicked
girl, I will write to her [underline]if you wish it[/underline], & [underline]try[/underline] if I can produce an
attempt at [underline]effectual[/underline] reform, by which the poor Creature may be sav'd
from present, & perhaps [underline]eternal[/underline] ruin; & render'd what she [underline]ought[/underline] to be
[underline]to you[/underline]. I am not unconscious how presumptuous this offer may
