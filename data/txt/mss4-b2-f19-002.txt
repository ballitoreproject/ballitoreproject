Dear Cousin
My wife has been often expressing her uneasiness that thy kind commands were not sooner complied with, and that we did not before now let them [page looks folded so them makes more sense in context] know how it fared with me. This delay was not occasional through forgetfulness of thee not thy friendship, but ^by^ a variety of engagements, which took one upon my recovery +++
I have cause in a particular manner  to be thankful to good Providence for his gracious interposition in restoring me to health, for business was crowding upon me, and I was not then furnished with sufficient help. In the extremity of my sickness, I turned my eye towards him, and prayed that if it was his lov[e] he would avert my distemper, which was hard for me to bear, and particularly distuping at that season I have reason to think he heard and graciously answered my petition. I was soon relieved from my disorder, which held ^several^ others, my neighbours, a much longer time. I mention this as cause of encouragement to us, when we are proved with affliction of body or mind, to eye that hand that is merciful and powerful, and to make it our principal care and endeavour to seek after that strength and consolation which invigorates and cheers ^the heart^ that is truly humbled into a sense of its own unworthiness and the necessity of an entire dependance ^on^ and communication with the source of all goodness and saving help in time of trouble.
About the same time my Father was detained in England, ill of an intermitting fever: his true friend and companion James Christy attended him with most affectionate assiduity, and he got well home to us 9th unit ++
