My dear E - I am sorry
thou are not here, when
ever I see M Richardson
I think of thee & say [deletion]to[/deletion]
to myself, what a pity!
I have done nothing
for thee yet except the
Harmony which I send
by Mary I hope it
will suit thee I
make the a present
of it a great mother
truly! I gave the
stockings to Lydia
& will send her these

by some one at
the meeting I
intend Margt
desired I should say
she was very much
obliged for the [underline]new[/underline]
stockings
To [unclear]Sh[/unclear] Webb
I was very much disappointed
this morning at
receiving a corrected receipt
from the GPO for
only 2Â£ as I had hoped
that according to thy
promise thou wouldst
have arranged that
order so as that I should
have got credit for the
amount.
