Ballitore: 14/12 mo: 1779

My dear Cousin,
	I am favoured with thine of 6th. instant, which is very acceptable. We are concerned that thou hast been so much indisposed, ^I^ wish it may be consistent with the Divine Will that thou be favoured (after all thy past troubles) with a portion of health & tranquillity, & to enjoy thy near connexions partakers of the same blessings. However, if it seem meet to Infinite Wisdom that our tranquillity be disturbed, that the lives of our nearest friends & relatives be touched, & that adversity in one shape or other be our lot; what can we poor, weak creatures do, but in all loneliness submit to the hand while which smiles, & seeking with filial fear & solicitude to place ourselves & those we love under the Divine protection, leave the issue of all to a merciful Creator? Let us not anticipate trouble - "Sufficient to the day is the evil thereof." Every cloud that gathers does not burst into a storm. As sometimes troubles come upon us which we did not expect, so at other times the calamity which we feared is suspended or averted. Through all, the Almighty Arm is sufficient to defend from above, & to support underneath. Besure nothing happens his children without his providence, & if they ^but^ keep close enough to him, & wait with all diligence upon him, he will assuredly minister to them consolation adequate to their necessities. And this I am persuaded has been thy repeated experience +++
	I understand that Thomas Colley is returned in peace & safety, having visited such of the W. India islands as he could get himself conveyed to in these perilous, turbulent times, & that he had found acceptance among the people, & a door of utterance. He returned (I suppose) a satisfactory account of his visit to the morning meeting in London. I think, in any chronicles of the history of our society, there is hardly to be met with a greater instance of entire devotion & dedication than this visit of this dear, simple, worthy man at such a time +++
	I have read John Griffiths journal, very entertaining & edifying: but the low, degenerate state in which he describes our poor society to be, must leave sorrowful traces on a tender, feeling mind - Yet these sensations may be profitable, tending to bring us into suffering with the seed, & to stimulate us to seek diligently after best help, that we may ^[pencil note] be enabled to^ do each our duty in our day, not by indolence & disobedience ^be^ treasuring up wrath against the day of wrath, but by simply acting & living according to knowledge revealed, ^&^ lay up good treasure against that day, in which the Lord Almighty will "render to every man according to his deeds. +++
I am, my dear [illegible], very affectionate friend & kinsman
Richard Shackleton.
