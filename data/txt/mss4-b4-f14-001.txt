My dear friend,
Often since I saw thee have I been favour'd to visit thee in spirit,
with fresh desires for our better & more firm establishment on the rock of ages; that nothing
may be able to separate us from the true faith in him who has done abundantly for us
& I have an humble hope shall do yet more & more, to his own honour & praise; & that
we may be earnest to promote his honour & not our own, to seek him & not ourselves, & to
be enabled effectionally to shew forth his praise to others, is my fervent petition & prayer.
How poor, how grovelling is any other pursuit - & in the light of Truth how do we see
many seeking praise of men, & the honour one of another? My heart is wounded, when
I find some exalting this fleshly wisdom, & not enough in their meek & humble lives &
conversations magnifying & making honourable that wisdom, which is from above -
which is first pure, unadulterated with fleshly wisdom - then peaceable (O heart felt
peace)! "My peace shall be with you" - O heavenly gentleness! O sweet & humble temper, w.ch
is easy to be entreated! - My heart, Dear Anna, how bowed in gratitude since I left
is easy to be entreated! - My heart, Dear Anna, has bowed in gratitude since I left
my native home for this land of my ancestors; that the same hand still continues
to guide & to work by the same operations of the same blessed & Holy Spirit on my
to guide & to work by the same operations of the same blessed & holy Spirit on my
mind, bringing me down into real abasement, that I become like a little child, helpless,
& hope harmless, but separate from sinners; having my views & expectations
only from the Father of mercies, who still mercifully [unclear]sheds[/unclear] abroad of his fatherly
protection & care; & will not let one of his little ones be lost; taking them still in his arms,
guiding them in green pastures, by fresh fountains of the water of life - I say I have
often found myself near thee, being weak & helpless, looking within myself, looking
all around seeing the works of the children of men, which they have made for themselves,
& finding [underline]confusion[/underline] marked upon every stately building, however speciously
constructed in their own imaginations, but not nicely compacted as the heavenly
building is - & I have rejoiced in my humble allotment, that but a small portion
of cunning was given unto me, & that I am drawn by an inevitable force to place my
dependence & my confidence on the Lord alone. Here is much simplicity in this north-land
of England, & (I conceive) a proper soil for the seed of the Kingdom to grow & flourish
why it does not put forth & grow with abundant increase, is known only to him,
in whose hand are times & seasons, & who can turn the hearts of the children of men,
in whose hand over times & seasons, & who can turn the hearts of the children of men,
even as a man turneth the water-course in his field. The company of Alice Rigge
& her sweet family has indeed been like tasting of a brook by the way, as she (dear creature)
express'd respecting us; for the good rejoice in being enabled to communicate. Her daughter
Hannah I love, she is so like our own Hannah - she (dear, sweet creature) looks exhausted
by close attendance on a friend her cousin, a young woman, who about two weeks
ago died at their house. She seems possess'd of that Christian spirit, which the dear folk

overs

[unclear][/unclear] of our Lord find ready at their hearts, to die for one another. Such is the force of divine
love - May that temper of holy Jesus more & more spread & prevail, till it cover all the earth!
How earnestly did Abraham of old intercede for the inhabitants of Sodom, who no doubt
were his enemies? But Christ hath taught us a still [unclear][/unclear] lesson - how does our delicacy
melt away, & become as nothing, when brought into competition with this animating
fervour, which coveteth the salvation of all? I dispatched a letter from Kendal to my beloved
Lydia, which, as thou loves' to hear from thy little brother, she (who is ready to communicate)
has imparted - We left the dear friends of Kendal with hearts swelling to the capacity of
the love we felt, but not able to contain, & journeyed to the place, where this is dated - We had
received billets from our friends then, & we put up at the house of John Birkbeck, who is married
to another daughter of William Dillworth, four sisters, whom I much admire, except
one that I have not seen. John is not at home, but his wife afforded that cordial welcome, w.ch
cheers the pilgrim on his way. Please inform all whom it may concern that I get my health
very well, only excepted the loss of my voice, while at Ulverston & Kendal, from a hoarseness,
which seems now pretty much removed. I had no sore throat, Lydia; nor any other inconvenience,
only that I could not express to the full my sense of the kindness I received - Here is
a Sally Birkbeck at this same Settle, who has got the right [unclear]damp[/unclear], & wears it well - she is
a sister of John Birkbeck, who is married to my cousin. From hence we past to Skipton, a
name I esteem almost equal to Ballitore, because the cradle of my honoured grandfather
& grandmother. I found here a Doctor Hall, grandson of David Hall - he seems an accomplish'd
man, & (they say) gets good practice in his profession. From hence we came to Leeds, &
being late set up at an inn. The road we passed along since we came into this land is such as
would abundantly gratify the inquisitive traveller - so abundant in variety, so replete with
objects of admiration & surprise. I have mentioned them more at large in a little account I
have taken at inns, &c., as I came along: But in vain does my pen attempt to set forth, but
only to excite in my own mind the remembrance of the grand, the magnificent, the awful,
the delightful, & richly luxuriant works of Providence, which we beheld. I have never seen
any thing so gaily picturesque as the serene bosom of Ulswater, or Winermeer reflecting
the waving groves, which crown the spiry summits of their beautious islands; nor so awfully
sublime as the rocks & the cascade, which surround & compose the enchantment of Lyulph's
Tower - Climbing over these hills, & sated with these objects, when I have turned my eye
within, & beheld the creation there, I have often wander'd over, like hideous wilds, & beheld
out-stretched, empty space, where the earth seems built upon nothing, my spirit has recoil'd
often from the thought of rocks, & uncultivated spots presented there, till the hand
which produced, dressed all the amiable face of animated nature has appeared, dispersed
chaos, & allow'd me to believe that he would dress & cultivate & water till the whole creation
was attired in beauty, like the blissful garden, when innocence fixed her first abode on
earth. I have found in this mental view that travelling over many miles does not
bring me often nearer home, nor remove me farther from it - that nothing but an union
with

with [unclear]uncreated[/unclear] excellence, & a fellowship with all the children of the family can truly
bring me there. I have looked back upon you I left there again & again, & still I find
that the Father of the family careth for you, & hath promised that not one shall perish, of
thou who have taken shelter under the wing of heavenly regard - that to such no dispensation
however grievous shall not turn to good account. So be it - & that so it shall be, let us ever humbly
hope, & trust, & daily put up this child like prayer, "Lord, I believe; help thou mine
"unbelief" - My companions Richd Abell & John Morris both in bed, & I believe asleep - (one
of them snoring) - having rode 40 miles this day since about eleven o'clock, & it now being
Twelve at night - they desire to be presented to you all in a portion of that love, which
has united us, & made our passage hitherto sweet & pleasant - Richd Abell just now
awaking bids me do him justice - I hope thou gets' some sleep now - I hope thou rests' -
I hope divine mercy condescends to hold up thy head still with the arms of his everlasting
love, - If so, all will be well; & a few years will lay our heads at rest in the dust,
where no trouble comes - happy if our spirits then find a blissful asylum from
death's arrowy storm, & the driving tempests of dismay, which sometimes becloud the setting
day - I have felt some little arrows as I came along - & the parting some dear friends I have
met with, has felt like death's potion; but resignation & heavenly help has triumphed
overall - May we at last on the wings of Seraphs say, "O death, where is thy sting?
"O grave, where is thy victory"? I need not make thee bearer of my love, only to Hannah,
my precious Hannah, Debby & Sally - But ye all know that I love - how much
I love I hope is still unknown even to myself Do take care of my Lydia. Farewell, &
pray for Thy affectionate friend --

P. S. Please inform my Lydia that I close this letter in company with aunt Hartley
who seems pretty well, & desires to be remember'd to the family - Tim Nevins has extended
the cords of old Irish hospitality, to bind us to himself - Francis Carbull & his
wife are to dine with us there - this is an amiable couple - Benny Wilson is by me,
& desires his love. Farewell. We design this afternoon for Ben: Birkbeck's, who lives at
Castleford - & to morrow we expect to be at week-day-meeting at Ackworth - Sally Dillwyn
past through Leeds third day for York - so we have mist her, to our grief - & York is
too far North - Please desire that father may write to James Abell, & let him know
where we are.
