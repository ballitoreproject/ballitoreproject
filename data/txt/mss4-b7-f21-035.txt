Tent Lodge Dec. 3d 10-
I have been so near Death's door, that you
may almost my dear Friend consider this letter as coming
from the other World - for as yet I can scarcely be called a[deletion]n[/deletion]
rational Being in this - About three months since, being
thrown out of the Gig, I fractured my Skull & I was thought [deletion]in[/deletion]
in considerable danger for some weeks - I own I had hopes that
my eventful Life was come to its close, but it pleased God it should
be otherwise, & therefore it must be right - I am now got about
again, but unable to bear any exercise but walking - 3 or 4 voices
create confusion & almost distraction, - whilst a cold blast gives
acute pain to the fractured part, - thus circumstanced, there
seems little probability of my seeing the other side of the Mountain,
so that I may be said to be walking through the valley
of the shadow of Death, - though perhaps not in immediate
danger of dying - Poor Jn: has met with a yet worse accident;
by a fall, she has separated all the Ligatures of the left Hip & Leg
There is neither Fracture or Dislocation, - but she has kept her Bed

19 weeks, & makes no effort towards sitting up. Her health is
particularly good, & she really gains flesh - Our friend Thomas
Wilkinson found us last week in the state I have described, & as
we naturally talk'd of you, I found he was to send a Frank to you
therefore resolved to scrawl a few lines - I am very sorry to hear that
you are tormented by dilatory Booksellers, I believe the complaint
is not confined to Ireland - Their profits are enormous, & their insolence
[unclear]in[/unclear] proportion - upwards of £2,000 worth of fragments have been sold,
[unclear]but[/unclear] Mrs. Bowdler & I have not yet received clear £130 between us - I should
expect your publication would answer in the end, it is so well calculated
to effect good - Mrs. Hamilton always sells her Copy, & strongly recommends
that mode, - but it is not the most satisfactory way, though
the surest & least troublesome — If a work [underline]takes[/underline], you receive too little;
[unclear][/unclear] it does [underline]not[/underline], you get too much,— I never wish for either the one, or the other
I am very glad to receive so good an account of my Ballitore Friends
I assure you I am incapable of forgetting the kind attention I received
[unclear]fr[/unclear]om them,- I always feel a great interest in their welfare—
I do not admire the writings of Miss Owenson, they are too studied
too affected to please me, - although there were parts of the Wild Irish
[unclear][/unclear]il, extremely well drawn. The account you give of her Person & Manners,
[unclear]a[/unclear]re just such as I should expect from those works I have seen —
My head will not allow me to do any thing long together, — & I am unable

to read any Book that requires attention, — I have therefore since
my accident dealt more in Novels than usual — One has greatly
pleased me, & if you have not already read it, pray do — Mmde. de Genlis
is the Author—it is "La Seige de la Rochelle" — the support & comfort
of Religion is admirably proved,— & the effects of undeserved Praise,
& undeserved Calumny, on two amiable Characters, is well portrayd—
Have you seen Scott's "Lady of the Lake"? you must read it.
& give me your opinion — I agree with you, that Mr. Stanley
stands for too high in his own estimation to please me, — I
[unclear]verily[/unclear] believe the more we know of our Christian duties
the more weak we shall feel ourselves, & the less we shall
presume on our own Merits. I hope you find the good effects
of the Bible Society amongst your Peasantry — I am a warm
advocate for the benefits likely to result from this Institution,
yet it is marvellous, the opposition made to it, by most of the
great Dignitaries of our Church! it seems to me the worst part
of Popery, to with-hold the Scriptures entirely, unless they are
read with one interpretation — I love our Established Church, & think
it Orthodox in its Tenets,—but God forbid that I should keep the
Scriptures from those who understood them differently! Mine is a
dull letter, but you dear Friend will kindly make allowance for a

fractured Skull, & believe me very Sincerely
Yrs.

I have just heard from Louis, he is in
great Spirits at Surinam, & says he does
not much care about returng. home as his health is so very good in
warm Countries — Turpin begs to be kindly remember'd to yrself & the Doyle [unclear][/unclear]
We have it reported that [unclear][/unclear] (who married Miss Keatings) has [unclear][/unclear]
the death of his Far. succeeded to 6,000 [unclear]P yr.[/unclear] — Can it be possible? He is
not the eldest Son — pray try & learn the truth of this — I have a
reason for the enquiry, but beg you not to mention that I have [unclear][/unclear]
it —
