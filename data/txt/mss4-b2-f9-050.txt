Ballitore: 11/1 month 1781
My dear Debby,

			After writing yesterday to the last line of the first page of the Letter which accompanies this, I received thine of 7th instant. I am concerned for the Jumble which has been about this matrimony-affair, but hope in a little time it will subside, & things get into a right channel. A little Quietness, passiveness & patience sometimes will obtain the desired end more speedily & completely than earnestness & striving, not to say contention & Strife. I just call to mind the great woman, as she is termed in Scripture - I believe she was also a good woman; but it looks as if her spirit was not sufficiently humbled & reduced - She had lost her child - she applied indeed to the Prophet, but it was in the impatience & perturbation of her spirit - therefore it would seem that the means used for the child's Recovery did not succeed immediately - But as she kept near the Prophet & would not leave him, in his own time he went into the house & fulfilled the desire of the heart of the Shunammite. So, my dear friend, exercise humility & patience, & in due time I hope what is right will take place. There is no time lost about Peggy - she is young enough, though ripe in understanding - A little cross thrown in the way before marriage may perhaps be of service, & ensure them the better to bear what may follow after - All events are either by Divine ordering, or Divine permission - The state of Saul the Lord's anointed also occurs to me - the spirit of the Lord departed from him, & an evil spirit from the Lord troubled him" - But the visited stripling David by the skilfulness of his hands in the exercise of his Gift was made instrumental to chase away that evil spirit; & the text says, Saul loved him greatly, & he became his armour-bearer. Thus I wish Truth may predominate in all your hearts, & that Love which is the badge of discipleship - that so that Enemy which soweth discord among Brethren may be defeated, & cast out, & that ye might be made one another's joy in the Lord - I own I do not approve of every thing which comes under my own observation respecting that dignified Luminary in your Province, who shone like a light in a dark place - but who is there exempt from alloy of some kind or other? He has been very much the companion of my thoughts, with anxious solicitude - I fear greatly about him, & I wish for a capacity effectually to intercede on his behalf, considering myself, & knowing that though he is tempted one way, I may be tempted another way, & that it is only by Grace that any of us can stand - Though I did not hear of it before, yet it is not at all strange to me that there have been Rubbers among those of the foremost rank. It was plain that the bile was swelling - For my part, I am encompassed with fears, both about myself & others: & am sometimes as it were at my wit's end, to know what to think, or to judge who is right, & who is wrong - But this I think I see, that it is best for me to stand single, waiting for a capacity to offer the daily sacrifice, both for myself & others, & earnestly to implore the Divine Protection & Favour for us all. I am sensible of thy friendship in opening thy mind to me, & it is agreeable that thou should throw out of that of which thou art full - but I would not have thy mind filled with these things - they are safe with me; but I fear lest it should not be safe for thyself to harbour them - I mean hard thoughts, though too much unprovoked cause be given for them - There is a sort of laudable Self-love & Self-preservation: If another without cause hurts me, why should I therefore hurt & wound myself?
Thus, my dear Cousin, I have thrown out what presents - it is the effusion of true friendship, & I think, feeling that, I may venture to say any thing to thee - However I thought it best to write this distinct from the other Letter, for some reasons, & in hopes that the free commerce of sentiments & feelings will continue to be kept up between us, remain
affectionately thine
	Richard Shackleton.
