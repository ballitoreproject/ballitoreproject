My dear friend,
on[underline] Innocence[/underline] - but I believe I may let the first stand - for sure [underline]Innocence [/underline] is thine -
if so: it far eclipses all the fine things that can be produced in verse or prose, or
have been said, since the loss of paradise — It is said that heaven made man
upright, but he has sought out to him many inventions — This charge you
to make good the change, what poets themselves acknowledge — that they deal
in fiction — Now let us only ask, Is this "The Truth"? — if not; it will not
stand the fire, by which every man's work is to be tried — I myself have some
little taste for poetry & imitative arts; but no capacity to figure; only to admire.
Notwithstanding: I seriously reprobate the unlimited latitudes that poets take -
I am afraid they are not compatible with the rule prescribed by the Gospel — I
may not say I fear; for I am not concerned to save an iota of all that has been
produced since the afore-mentioned period of the loss of Paradise, out of the pure,
the spotless Truth — Next to that consideration, my second proposition to a Christian
Poet is this — Are these fictions, the devices of our brain, the creature of our own
making, a likeness? (certainly, or no Poetry) — & do we fall down to them? — do we
worship them? — at least, do we admire them? — But it is not allowed us to rejoice
in the works of our own hands — that privilege belongs only to One — "the
"Lord shall rejoice in his works" — If we thus rejoice, & warm ourselves with
sparks of our own kindling, what is the consequence the prophet tells — & or
further consequence I apprehend — that we shall not delight in the simplicity
of the Gospel — The only excuse I can find for the Christian Poet is David — But
I was going to say I admire thy [underline]Innocence[/underline] — I mean thy poem
then
poets had need to see to, how you have contributed to establish — It is enough

then Musick too was sanctified, & equally allowable — for they both ought to
be applied to sacred purposes, or not to any; as dangerous instruments in the hands
of the luxurious, or profane — [underline]But[/underline] both are abolished; & all that showy exteriour
of the outward pomp of Religion & religious services, by the far more exceeding beauty
of the inner court & tabernacle; where the building & ornaments are perfect holiness
& all the Musick & Poetry consists in the expression of unspotted Purity from
the mouths of saints crying "holy, holy, holy! thou alone art worthy of praise
of glory, honour & blessing; for all this [underline]new[/underline] creation is [underline]thine,[/underline] & for [underline]thy[/underline] glory they
are & were created — Now I would spare the Poets, & allow them to chant to the sound
of the viol, did Christianity allow any time for this delight — but I do not see how
this is at all compatible with "Rejoice evermore — Pray without ceasing" — Nor
do I, or can at all see how a Christian can take any delight in anything, but in the
Truth itself; & be chaste to the Beloved of Souls — After all, I believe I would read
thee some verses now, but Mary says she sent off a fleet, which she supposed
on the way when thou wrote, & perhaps ere now are come to hand — Perhaps
thou art now glutted with them, & [deletion][/deletion] through satiety begins to think with
me — Now do not let this my profession (which I hope to hold fast), hinder thee
from writing to me with the usual freedom — I delight in a chaste & friendly intercourse
with the worthy, for my own sake — That, if possible, I may assimilate
to some faint resemblance of that holy thing, which I admire above all things.
Farewell — I feel an affection this moment for thee, which I pray may grow &
flourish — & that thou & I may join, in future existence, in one incorruptible
song of praise to him, who alone is worthy forever.
