My dear Molly's acceptable lines of 4th [unclear][/unclear] also a sweet letter from dear Betsy
Pim by W. Grubb, did not reach me till 6th mo. The above little tokens of
regard tenderd my mind, & I will now own that I had wrote you both since
my landing here, but not meeting with a private hand I [unclear]committed[/unclear] them to
the flames - so thou may find that [insertion]tho[/insertion] you were [insertion]out[/insertion] of sight, you were not out of my mind.
Thy messuage of love to R J. & S G was sent them a few days ago. R. J. writes
(2nd. Inst. that SG. John Pemberton & her self were then at York at Lindley Murray
whom they apprehended was near the solemn close — which however might not
be that week or the next — He slept little [unclear]swelld[/unclear] in his body, & breath with great
difficulty — but the state of his mind was truly comfortable — all seemd Light
Life & sweetness about him, & he said there was not cloud in his way — This is a
comfortable hearing to us. — I wd. gladly have gone to him, but must leave it till
my G'D is disengaged from the Dales of Yorkshire where he now [insertion]is[/insertion] & perhaps in abt.
a week or 10 days he may return, & take me along. SG & R J. had a chaise &
horse provided for them, & expected soon to move towards Cheshire & some other of the
western counties - RJ. felt nearly releasd from the northern parts of the nation.
I'm sorry thy dear mother had so bad a cold my very dear love is to her & tell her
I take it kind that she sometimes thinks of me - I'm sure I shall not easily forget
her - When I was at the house of the widdow Sarah Irwin at Wigton my
mind was often turnd back to Ballitore, for I came to you with a bad cough, & at
this good widows house I was confind with the same complaint [insertion]3 weeks[/insertion] & she kindly
assisted my recovery, as did [deletion]as did[/deletion] thy compassionate Mother for so long a time
without being weary of me. My cough is now better but far from being remov[insertion]d[/insertion]
however I will [insertion]not[/insertion] distrust since I [underline]did[/underline] meet with one [underline]Mother[/underline] Shackleton tho far
separated from your lov'd Retreat — Had I thy [underline]pen[/underline], I might give a moving
little History of the widdow Ive mentioned. She has met with more crosses, than
I ever knew to fall to the share on one woman, in regard to husband & children—
G.D was an intire stranger to her affairs, & yet he told me that as she came
at first to meet him, the following expressions came lively to his mind
"These are they that come thr'o tribulation, hav G. their Robes washd white in the
"blood of the lamb" We left Wigton abt. 3 weeks ago, & came in a post chaise
to Kendal, going by the lakes, thro' a most romantic country, The Hills are many
& I that lookd awfully grand - I often wishd for thy company in this excursion —
has't thou seen a discription of these places-?
I am now at the house of Isaac Wilsons 4 single daughters. They are kind agreable
girls, the Eldest of whom sent me an affectionate invitation, other wise I had intended
to have pitchd my tent with the worthy Alice Rig - who has not long since
lost by death a belovd daughter havg. been married only abt. 3 months - She has another
daughter in a declining way. I have given dear Rachel Wilson &
sisters a deal of trouble, but they will not allow it is any — This being [unclear]centered[/unclear]
I have had more of my GDs company than I cd. expect — which is truly comfortable
to use both, especially as I'm no hinderance to him— The dear creature is
very diligent not havg. laid by one whole day since landg. & is favd. with good
health - which I esteem a singular mercy - I parted with him last 2nd. day at
Ledberg, accompanied by P. Brayton & Phebe blakes (now here for a few days)
They had a large gathering in [insertion]ye[/insertion] court house, chiefly comoposd of other societies, & a favd
time I believe it was- On our first arrival here we found Mary Davis
Kendall 2nd. mo. 9th. 1786.
where for some days, they had been waiting on our dear aged brother Thos. Ross

& Mehetable Jinkins, who I understand by letter, are now at Whitehaven
on a family visit joind by John Hall George Bewley & Jane Pearson, but [underline]this[/underline]
may be no news to you— I rejoice with you, that thy dear sister Grubb has
got well over her tryal, I did expect from [underline]appearances[/underline], by report, that
there wd. have been twains - however perhaps the poor dear creature might
think one at a time quite enough — my GD lately sent a few lines to thy
sist. Sally, I put a PS. - my love is to her when thou writes -
John Wilsons wife, formerly Sarah Dilworth, claims thy dear father as a
relation for whom she appears to have a sincere esteem - both she & her
sister are friendly agreable women — they both look in the increasing way
apresent — what a chit chat scrawl I am giving thee - but mind 'tis
only for thy own self — I write by scraps & shall be again calld off presently —
P. Brayton has sufferd me to coppy a letter sent her by a
clergyman, but knows not of my intention to give it thee; she's not
willing her name shd. appear, nor do I think it prudent to let it spread
least it shd. some to the poor mans knowledge - Tho perhaps it [underline]may,[/underline]
without thy help, as she tells me, a frd. get it from her in Yorkshire & kept
it some time. — We were grievd to hear dear Z.D continued indispos'd —
when oppoy. offers, let him know we think of him with affectionate
sympathy — & our desires are that he may be bourn up against every
discouragement of body or mind — his low state of health must be discouraging —
If the weather has been as cold with you, as with us, dear
Anna Taverner must have been a sufferer by it. Tell her she is often
brought to our rememberance with great nearness, & I hope she will some
times think of us in her retired moments, & wish us well, as a brother & sister, that
dearly loves her. her faithful Sallys absense must be felt by her, nothwithstanding
all your tender attention to enliven her lonely hours—I had heard of the [underline]decease[/underline] of
some of the friends thou mentions — Poor [underline]Tommy Watson's[/underline], made [insertion]me[/insertion] feel sorrowful on
his parents accot. tho I hope their minds were favd. to resign him to [unclear][insertion]ye[/insertion][/unclear] hand that gave
them so well inclind a son — I have lately heard of the death (by the smallpox) of a promising
young man in your land, who was some days with our little Band — These are
memento's - O my Molly may thou & I, (when it comes to our turn) be not afraid
to die — It is very good in thee to prepare for any amusement, by making up
the collection of pieces we usd to talk abt. but I fear thou wilt give thyself too much
fatigue by so doing. I really do not think that close application to the pen will agree
with thy health - if thou writes any thyself - do it leisurly. If they are ready [insertion]by[/insertion] the yearly Meetg.
it will be time enough.
Remember me affectionately to thy kind Br. & sister Shackleton
& MM. also thy dear valued parents, your own family, & the friendly neighbours abt. you
as if particularly nam'd - If it wd. not be too much trouble, I wish thy father to mention
my love to dear Jos. Williams & wife, & Jos. Pike & wife — when in the boat, I turnd round
to give one [deletion]more[/deletion] last look at your shores - & those dear friends who had been straining
ev'ry nerve (shall I say?) for our comfortable accomodation — Molly thou hast a
feeling heart. & will not wonder that an involentary tear stole down my cheek—
Farewell - my dear friend - I am affectionately thine

I've just recd. a letter from my GD dated yesterday, in Wensley Dale 8 miles from Dent
he tells me he thot so much of dear T Ross in the night, that as he shd. be within 30 miles
of York, he had concluded to go there before he returnd here — A frd. had told him that
Rebecca Wright & companion were visiting families in Bristol — I have not
[underline]now[/underline] got thy dear kind fathers desk to run to, for a bunch of new pens — O Molly
I never shall — but — I must begin this coppy for thee with my old pen — I think
the letter looks sadly long — however as I cant meet with a private hand the more there
[underline]is in it — the[/underline] more thou'l have for thy money — It may serve for a long time
"Friend — That love that thinketh no evil & rejoiceth in the truth constraineth me to say
that your exortation on Wednesday evng was suited to my case or state - I am humbly thankful
god hath not left me without his witness in my heart, & also that he hath inclined you
to point me out — May I humbly & patiently wait his time of Deliverance, & follow by faith
his fiery & cloudy pillar all thro' this howling Wilderness — — — I have I humbly hope
preachd [deletion]the[/deletion] Jesus Christ, but not in yr. societies, & I hope in a good measure with a single eye to
the glory of God. — but how havg. been lately exercisd with many & severe trials from the profess'd church
have been led to retire more inward, to commune with my own heart & be still - I see (my own
Ignorance, my will worship, my forms & modes & gospell schemes, my unfeeling prayers
& often unseasonable preachings without spirit & life) as only arising from a carnal mind
which is enmity [insertion]against[/insertion] [deletion]with[/deletion] god & the imagination exalting it self against him — From 6 years of age
I have tasted at seasons divine love & favr. but I must lament that I have too too often lost the favr.
of his precious Truth, may it be so no more! Many times (like Israel) [deletion]I[/deletion] have [insertion]I[/insertion] been delivered &
& as often like them have I provok'd him by distrust &c yea he hath chastised me & I have been like
a Bullock unaccustomd to the Yoke — Oh! That I might be so moulded into his heavenly Image
& daily learn to say experimentally thy will be done — He indeed renewed his love to me that evng
& since he hath caused his grace to distill as the Dew, & has given me to know that in his own
time & way he will lengthen my cords & strengthen my stakes & cause me to break out on the right
& on the left. I feel my spirit melting while I write this, with the tenderest love & affection towards
you that minister in the word, & towards your societies — I joy in your joys! & shd. sorrow
in yr. sorrows did I know them — pardon me if I go too far in saying that I have seen
in my mind what the Lord will do in his own time. Antichrist will fall with all his
power, & a pure primitive church perhaps like thine arise out of its ruins, for in the
evng time it shall be light — & Heat shall shine brighter & brighter & lengthen to the perfect Day. —
I have been burthen'd with the weight of awful fearful apprehension that the Lord God
hath a controversy with us as a nation laden with iniquity — his hand has been — is —
& will be streth'ed out against us - if we do not repent & turn to him with all our
minds — Ah friend: I know by many years of experience tho I am but a young man that if you
are faithful to reprove publickly & privately you will suffer persecution, perhaps even among some
of your own whole hearted people, for all are not Isreal (that are born of Isreal) but continue you
unto [underline][insertion]faithful[/insertion][/underline] Death, & you know who hath said he will give you a crown of Life —
I conclude - may the peace of God rule in your hearts, & may you be stirred up to thankfulness to
him in yr. spirit, on mine accot. & may all who heard you that evng. if He so [unclear]wi[/unclear], meet to
praise for ever. As to me, at a suitable season, Thy people shall be mine, I will live
& die in their communion, & among them will I, [insertion]if the Lord please,[/insertion] if I can be buried. Thy God is my God —
& to his grace I am a great debtor. When you find freedom in prayers
Remember your affectionate friend. W. F."

A few days before we left Dublin we recd. a packet from America, our belov'd connections were in
usual health - one [insertion]of[/insertion] my neices had passd 2 meetings with a deserving young man of the name of
Morris — another of our neices had lost by death a son - her first child - we had at the same time
an acct. of the mariage of my G.D.s only sister to a valuable young man by name John Cox
lately come out in the Ministry — My friendly enquiries, must appologize for this addition

R Jones says that SG. was gone to attend the funeral of Joseph [unclear]Tatam[/unclear] - [underline]She[/underline] mentions decease of Joshua Forbs - is it one that I know
in yr. land? - Thy next letter to me wd. be doubly valuable if thy dear mother wd. only sign her name in it - I dont
mean by that, I shd. wish for more - Perhaps I may never see her again - I fear yr nice plants are hurt by the
hard frost. -
