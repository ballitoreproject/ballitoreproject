Endeared Friend,
Since I saw thee, I have passed thro' some exercise &
buffeting both from within & without & at times ready to sink under things, but
with a heart in some degree thankful, I may acknowledge my own unworthiness, &
bless his name, that hath given me to believe, that as I keep to the directions of the
great Prophet, the little meal will hold out to the end, that thereby any life may be
preserved thro' famine, tho at times we may be ready to rejoice in tribulation, feeling
that arm that made even the saints to shout for joy, may we by the rod & by the
staff be so fitted & prepared, that we may stand trials of a nearer kind, even when we
are tossed as without anchor; may the Lord whom we desire to serve (whatever becomes
of these bodies of ours,) feed us with food convenient, & keep us out of the heights by day,
& the depths by night, & may we take honey out of the carcass of the Lion, from whom
we have been delivered, & then make right use of it; [it's said one render'd not again
according to the benefit received] . I conclude thou knowest more of the turnings & twistings
of the subtile serpent, & that all is to be given up, that we may follow the Lamb.
I had freedom to say thus much, & desire I [deletion]still[/deletion] may [insertion]still [/insertion] be kept hungering after my proper food.
Now, dear Margaret, whereas a great nearness of affection took hold of my
mind, (when at Shipton) towards thee; now it is in my mind, after having obtain'd
needful consent of relations to make an offer to thee by letter; seeing I cannot at present
come over without much blame [insertion]from [/insertion] friends here; I pray thee do not expect a formal courtship,
but give me answer in simplicity, whether finds freedom to join with me in this
weighty concern of marriage, let us keep to simplicity, leaning to that hand that alone is
able to make us helpmates one to another; & helps us thro' trials & exercises that likely may
betide us on this side eternity. I may reasonably expect an agreeable answer, to this in a
short time, after some years of consideration; I desire an answer to this, & write freely for
we have no need to lay burdens on one another's shoulders: which concludes with
entire respects to thy self & relations,
thy affectionate friend.

A: S: to Margt Wilkinson.
