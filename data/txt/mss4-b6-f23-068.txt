Postm'. of Btore
Tis done - from wife & children [insertion]born[/insertion]
Deep in a prison's gloom forlorn
Poor Dolon, with awaken'd eyes
[unclear][/unclear] of [unclear][/unclear] & folly lies

May I presume my Tale to bring
To him whom Truth has taught to sing,
The moral bard, whose living lay
Allures the step to Virtue's way?
What though on that respected brow
The brightest wreaths of genius glow,
That pitying brow is kindly bent
On tastes, though ill perform'd, well meant.
Yet Crabbe's high name for such a song
Invoked, that honour'd name may wrong.
Dolon in humble plenty blest,
The comforts of his lot confess'd
Those fields the harvest robes array'd,
Thro' these his well-fed cattle stray'd;
His art, his toil the fleece transform
Into the garment [deletion]fair[/deletion] [insertion]strong[/insertion] & warm.
Thus honest gains appear'd around
But one superior blessing crown'd
All other gifts - a virtuous wife
Frugal, industrious, graced his life.
While thus the medal fair was eyed
Who thought upon the other side
'Tis turned - behold a sad reverse -
That draught, of [insertion]Erin's isle[/insertion] [deletion]Ireland's[/deletion] land the curse.
Inflaming Whiskey, Dolon lov'd,
Its dire effects too oft he prov'd,
The gains of many a toilsome day,
Swept in a few short hours away.
Repentance comes with heavy tread,
And thickening clouds hang o'er his head,
And many an earnest vow is made,
Thus never more to be betray'd.
Temperance & toil [deletion]apt[/deletion] resum'd again
The lighten'd heart forgets its pain,
Alas another festal day
Arrives - appear the comrades gay
"Shall Patrick's eve [deletion]dis[/deletion][insertion]un[/insertion]honour'd pass?
Come, Dolon, take the social glass."
He goes - resolv'd his steady soul
Shall brave the [deletion]dangers[/deletion] [insertion]allurements[/insertion] of the bowl.
Trust not thy strength - temptation nigh,
Dolon [insertion]tis[/insertion] [deletion]till[/deletion] wise, tis brave to fly
This shalt thou own, [deletion]& shalt[/deletion] [insertion]thy fault[/insertion] deplore,
When the lost, misspent day is o'er.
More & more frequent now is quaff'd
Urged by despair, the desperate draught;
[insertion]And now[/insertion] Alas! [deletion]for now[/deletion] the desert drear
[insertion]Of want[/insertion] and the cold blast [deletion]of want[/deletion] is near
[deletion]And now[/deletion] He feels it, [insertion]shrinks, and[/insertion] with dismay;
His Independ[deletion]e[/deletion][insertion]a[/insertion]nce melts away.
A wily neighbour's anxious care,
Watch'd Dolon & his pastures fair,
And spread for him the secret snare:
Those wants his ready purse supplied
Which Dolon from the world would hide;
This aid high interest must [insertion]com[/insertion][deletion]de[/deletion]mand
Until redeem'd by Dolon's hand
And goods beneath their value paid
That dearly bought insidious aid.
Till Dolon to the treacherous bowl
Flies to relieve his tortur'd soul
The treacherous bowl & treacherous friend
Alike to [deletion]Dolon's[/deletion] [unclear][insertion][/insertion][/unclear] ruin tend.
The landlord now his right demands,
And seizes Dolon's forfeit lands
The neighbour comes - the land redeems -
Why is he not the friend he seems?
And does not generous pity plead,
And prompt the neighbour's kindly deed
Oh now, he sees the tempest dread
Bursting on that devoted head,
And only seeks his destin'd prey
Midst scenes of anguish & dismay.
Within a prison's dreary [deletion]bound,[/deletion] hold
The wretched Dolen now [deletion]is found[/deletion] behold

[deletion]While the[/deletion]
And while the waste of former days
Conscience, with keen reproach displays
[insertion]Swift[/insertion] [deletion]Then[/deletion] through his self-accusing heart
Tortures succeeding tortures dart.
Yet one there was his grief to share
And calm the struggles of despair
'Twas she, whose [deletion]ceaseless[/deletion] [insertion]had long been[/insertion] cares [deletion]were[/deletion] tried,
[deletion]Vainly to[/deletion] stem [insertion][unclear]ming[/unclear] in vain[/insertion] misfortune's tide.
[deletion]'Tis true[/deletion] [insertion]And now[/insertion] with many a piercing groan
She [insertion]leaves[/insertion] [deletion]left[/deletion] the [insertion][underline]dwelling[/underline][/insertion] mansion once her own,
While her six babes around her throng,
And one unborn she bears along,
And neighbours kindly press to share
With her & those their homely fare.
No - she resolves to seek her mate,
And share & soothe his bitter fate.
