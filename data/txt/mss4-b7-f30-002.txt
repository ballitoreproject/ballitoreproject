3 note 1811 - not text
This morning past brought me thy letter, my kind friend, & I am
the more desirous to begin a reply because I believe the impending clouds ready
to break upon us & will for a season doubtless overwhelm us. I wish not to draw thee
into the vortex of our distress - I feel it would be too easy to do so, but may say that every
one who knows my lovely niece is now to be pitied, In our hopes are fled, & we behold her
gradually gliding away.
Our neighbourhood with the Bonhams has ended. In a [unclear][/unclear] I hope I may be
renewed. Our friendship with them I hope will be of long continuance. Margt.
Bonham is literally the Mother of our female school, which [insertion]opened one week ago[/insertion] which now contains 53 girls,
who learn to read & write, since open of 2nd. & promises [unclear][/unclear] exceedingly well. The Boys'
school consists of 102 & is admirable. If Mickl. Perry the schoolmaster landed [unclear]at[/unclear]
In Ballykaney is too true to old systems to be organized, we can I hope meet
with an intelligent young man who may be modelled according to Lancaster's
[unclear][/unclear]. We found that except £50 pound was raised in the Neighbourhood we could
not apply to the County for a assistance, but if there was that sum or any thing
which an equal sum would be granted. Therefore the smaller subscription
was laid aside, & a new one began at One guinea to per Ann paid by each
subscriber which it is expected with add a little infirmary to the Dispensary
& be more effectually useful. I am startled at thy mention of the gloves
[unclear]I there bespoke in summer, 8 pair, 4 of wch were for a child. I sent them as
soon as they could be made afterwards [insertion]with the magazines[/insertion] afterwards by a friend to Dublin by whom
they were sent to a Cornwall In King Street. I shall not be easy about them
till I hear again. I received no order [insertion]for gloves[/insertion] since from thee but have [unclear][/unclear] Magazines
to send. I believe thou forgot the poetry thou intended to enclose. I have never

Mother! & how many careless Mothers are there, justly compared to the Ostrich in the Wilderness!
I do not think any dialogues could afford subjects for drawings. If hereafter I should publish any thing
picturesque, I should be much obliged to [insertion][unclear][/unclear]son's[/insertion] [deletion]his[/deletion] [insertion]this schs][/unclear] pencil. But I am much discouraged from publishing
by the unforeseen, unaccountable, & yet unavoidable delay in publishing the Cottage Dialogues.
It was but yesterday I received the remaining [unclear][/unclear] from London, [deletion]my[/deletion] Johnson had sent [unclear]me[/unclear] before
for the Dublin Printer. And what must my subscribers think of me? I shrink from the idea—
That is owing to my loss of my second copy, & yet that was not a perfect one. so thy kind
gifts I look for much saving of time & trouble, first is most wearying to copy the same words
often I am not perfect at it yet, but expect to be so in time. Zobit is but a bad specimen,
my nephew wrote me that he intended to sent it in a frank of Lord Charleville's. But
if he delays long I will send another copy I intend, for I long more than ever for thy criticisms.
The person at whose instance I undertook it is the daughter of a woman whose natural
genius was improved by learning. I believe it was a fashion early in last century for young
women (Quakers however) to learn latin. This person, Dorothy Roberts, wrote some complimentary
lines to me when I was young a correspondence ensued which lasted her life. Twenty years
after her death I revived this correspondence (if I may say so) with her daughter, a woman
of still brighter genius, but self taught. Her modesty has been so excessive that she has burned
almost all she wrote. Her mother sent me one piece by stealth. I had heard of her Elegy
on her Mothers death, & sending her my Poems I begged for thus in return. She sent
it with a letter which raised my admiration of her, & we are now great friends tho' like my

seen Lord [unclear]Clancarty's[/unclear] list of premiums, but should be glad to see it. I am
glad thou hast got back to [unclear]Barsledon[/unclear].
"When smiling spring her earliest visit pays,
And parting Summer's lingering bloom delay"
And I enjoy with my whole heart thy delight in thy garden accompanied
by thy children. I cannot form to myself a more interesting or [unclear][/unclear] scene, or
picture to my mind a more happy mother & children. Long may you enjoy
sunshine - thy bright day has had its clouds. Hast thou read Lillies from
England by Dm Manuel Alvazez Esprulla I hear it is written by the
poet Southey conjointly with I forget whom. I have read two volumes I am
really pleased & entertained with it. "Lessons for Young Persons in humble
"life we intend to introduce into the schools, it being admirably adapted
for that purpose It is compiled I hear by a young woman, adopted & educated
by Lindley Murray & his wife. I forgot to say that in aid of our girls
school, our young people collect old & new linen, cut it out & assemble once a
week at our houses in rotation to make it up [insertion]the articles[/insertion] [deletion]It [deletion]unclear[/deletion] then sold for the use of
the school. This work is to be carried on in the school also, which we expect
will support itself. Since I wrote the foregoing I have finished Esporella's
letters. The 3d vol. contain a very favourable account of the Quakers in
some respects too favourable for many have so deeply ventured in commercial
speculations as to incur publick censure & are disunited from us on that account.
I suppose thou may have heard that Anne Grant who wrote Letters from
the Mountains, "Memoirs of an American Lady" &c, some time since
opened a boarding school in Edinburgh, which at first promised well, but

engraving I am both to say I believe thou might send a book by their conveyance which
brought this letter, because is seems as if I was more willing to receive than to give. Because
on applying leave to send these, I was [unclear][/unclear] rather [underline][unclear][/unclear][/underline], had I [unclear][/unclear] is a
mind. However I have a friend who goes often to London, & if thou will be so kind as
to [unclear]decide[/unclear] whose parcels shall be left for thee, I think he would be carful in the charge
of them. I understand [insertion]once I began this that [/insertion] [unclear][/unclear] non rather draws back, & expects encouragement
from thee which I am [unclear][/unclear] thou are not disposed to promise him, [deletion]encouragement[/deletion]
as he might not know where to bound his expectations, & of course relax his own exertions. I
am pleased [unclear][/unclear] that no school is yet [unclear][/unclear], because I hope the new plan will be adopted.

the power of thou who used to so there kindnisses being much abridged of
late, but I intend to send them & the linen with nurses Farrells petticoats
to Dublin very soon. Has thy ameable son returned? I feel his kindness
to me very sensiby. I heard yesterday from Wm Lefance. He is in London &
believe, & amuses himself attending Parliamentary Debates. If my wishes
could procure an interview between you, though & he had long since met
7th yesterday my husband returned from Dublin: The pleasure his return
always disscuses was much increased when he handed me two packets from
respected Friend. He could tell one nothing more about them
than that they had been left at his lodging. The first I opened happened to
be that which was first written & which accompanied the Essays. The
justness of Thy criticism struck me so forcebly that on re-perusing the passages
I wondered I had not written them exactly as thou pointed out: so convincing
is thruth. I am also pretty well convinced of my too great parttiality to [underline]old fashion[/underline],
for which ??? am remarkable & [unclear][/unclear] ....tly with good humoured raillery.
My inofficiency to judge of this matter also appears to me. I have only drawn
my own pictures from my own circle, especially of the old mansions. One of which
C????, is entwined with my [unclear]cached[/unclear] ideas. It was the residence of our near
[unclear][/unclear], a woman of wit & even some [unclear][/unclear] learning, yet a simple line by woman
& an excellent housewife. The husband was blind when he married her. He was one of
the happiest of men, notwithstanding this misfortune, for his honest heart was

to get a place in a respectable family who might to t[unclear][/unclear] in her daughter with her, for her sons ?
were too small to give her reason to [unclear][/unclear] [insertion][unclear][/unclear][/insertion] him there her son would [unclear][/unclear] "Keep safe &
body together" I then when [unclear][/unclear] had saved a little she might [unclear][/unclear] return to housekeeping with
more comfort. She seemed to agree heartily with me, but whether she will heed the proposal in

it, I know the land would be a desirable object to the McCades. [unclear][/unclear] had not come
here [unclear][/unclear]. If his children have recovered, as the weather is growing warmer; perhaps a little
gift to the industrious daughter accomplished by thy approbation of her conduct, might be as
acceptable as any thing else. I ought to apologize for this change of proportion but certain
glances have earned it. I fear thy eyes & patience will be tried by this letter. I think it far a
very [underline]chaotic[/underline] appearance. My [unclear][/unclear] is in part arranging I own but the greater past will maintain
it claim to that subline as [unclear][/unclear]. My husband joins me in best regards

[insertion][/insertion] of the wish that thou would write a paper [underline]against me[/underline] on the same

more. In the midst of the great affliction she now endures her character shines more ...
than ever. Thy medical advice, tho' at present it cannot serve my niece, I esteem as excellent
& expect to draw advantage from it. I have an excellent friend here who is ordered the warm
bath for the rheumatism, & I shall use thy name to enforce her compliance, for I dread losing a
friend, yet I almost forgot my present pain while I read thy account of thy son. I thought
tears into my eyes of real joy. The more uncommon such a character, the more valuable it
is as it shews a strength of mind able to resist the prevalence of example on one hand -
& a purity of heart inclining to adopt the example [deletion][/deletion] presented on the other hand. It is the
