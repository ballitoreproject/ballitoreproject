Tent Lodge Nov: 17th 1811 —
You are right, my valued Friend, all is for the best!
I have had such an abundant proof of its being so,— that now every
evil is lessen'd to me, even at the moment in which [insertion]it[/insertion] befalls me —
it is not that I perceive at that moment [underline]how[/underline] it is best, but the
general confidence former [unclear]Mesuis[/unclear] have inspired me with, tells
me that I shall ere long perceive, & acknowledge it — Since I
wrote last, I have had another painful duty to fulfill, - in directing
my Mother's Remains to be laid in the Grave. I left home directly
on hearing of her illness, but though I lost no time on the journey,
I did not arrive in London till a few hours after she had ceased
to breathe, — this disappointment affected me at the time, but I was
soon satisfied that it was Mercifully order'd to save me a sharper
pang, that of finding her totally insensible to my being beside her.
She was in her 85 year,- pious, & charitable, so that I humbly
trust she has made a blessed exchange — It is thus, my dear
Friend, we are loosen'd from Earthly ties, — our Friends & Relations
drop around us, till we are even desirous ourselves of being laid
beside them — I have often wonder'd at a common observation,
that the love of Life increased with years,—to me, it seems unnatural,-
the best comfort of declining years, is to know that they

will shortly end, & that the happiness of the next Life (thro' the
merits of our Saviour) depends not on the conduct of others —
I am perhaps getting into too serious a strain; I will therefore
reply to your request of knowing my honest opinion of your
Cottage Dialogues — I very [underline]highly approve[/underline] of them, & think they
are admirably calculated to effect all the good, which I know
your benevolent heart would wish — The Notes by Miss Edgeworth
are certainly an [underline]addition[/underline], but no advantage to the Work —
there is an affectation of Wit, & of Learning in them, which
ill-accords with the plain sound Sense, & pure simplicity of
the Dialogues — If the Book is intended to improve the lower
classes of Society (as I verily believe it will) I am confident
that more good would be effected [underline]without[/underline] the Notes, than with.
When you publish next, let it be without comments from
any one. — Your excellent Friend [unclear]Sefan[/unclear] will give you all the
benefit of his observations, & I am persuaded you will need no
others — Perhaps it is always best to take the opinion of a judicious
Friend, before publishing a Work, — because from perfectly
understanding our own meaning, we conceive we must
have made it clear to others,— which is not always the case,—
but I differ from Solomon who thinks that "in a Multitude of
Counsellors there is Safety" — I am sure the Fragments would

never have been publish'd, if dear Mrs. Bowdler had not at last
determined to be guided by her own judgment only — I am glad to
tell you it is the fashion in England to admire your Dialogues,
& I have strongly recommended them to some Irish Friends.
I wish some were Written for our English Peasantry, equally
well adapted to their customs — How very gratifying to
your feelings, must the amiable Miss Keatings's request, have
proved — She has shewn judgment, as well as benevolence, in
confiding such a trust to [underline]you[/underline], no one will more worthily
fulfill it — Your ci-devant Neighbor Mrs. Keatings, is now
become my Neighbour; The Lady with whom she lived is a Friend
of mine, with whom I am more intimate than with any other
Mrs. K. improves on acquaintance, & I am become much attached [unclear]to[/unclear]
her; she has good sense, & a sort of dry drole humour that amuses
me, - she is too, I think, an honorable character - Tell me how this
description, accords with your opinion. Thomas Wilkinson is a
perfect owl, he comes to me in the dark, & takes flight with the
Morning dawn, - nevertheless he is a worthy Being, & I highly value
him. He bought Turpin a pincushion, for which she begs a thousand
thanks & her duty — I wish you to read "Self Control" — it is a very
unequal Work, & the last part should be thrown into the Fire, as the
most improbable stuff imaginable,—but I am persuaded you will
like much of the Work - It is a Misfortune that Authors never know
when to have done, — Probably dear Friend, you will think the same of my
scrawl,

so I will only beg you, & all my old Friends at Ballitore, to accept
of my kind regards & sincere good wishes, — & assure you of the Estee[unclear]m[/unclear]
& affection of [unclear]G[/unclear]. — I feel for Col Keatings as I
too well know what his feelings must be.
I did not know Richard was to near us, — if he ever has any
Holidays & wod. come so far, I should be very glad to welcome him [unclear][/unclear]
here — The Major is at Preston, the complaint continues, & I fear [unclear]increases[/unclear]
but not too rapidly — Jn: now rides on Horseback, she still uses a [unclear]Crutch[/unclear]
but I believe more from habit than necessity — I know not [underline]when[/underline]
will receive this, for Mrs. Keatings has promised to enclose it to be frank'd to g[unclear][/unclear]
[underline]Ireland[/underline]
Mrs. Leadbeater
[underline]Ballitore[/underline]
