I feel my self so much obliged my Dear
M Shackleton, for thy attentive punctuality respecting
our poor suffering Friend A:T, that tho' I have been
closely engaged in necessary writing, all day, or most of
it, and seem to have nothing to [deletion]say[/deletion] [insertion]offer[/insertion] but a bare acknowledgment
of thy kindness — yet I am not willing to omit

think does not open a prospect of her long continuance in
mutability — and who that truly loves her can wish she

habitation of Eternal rest & peace, than to conflict with
the difficulties, the snares, the varied besetments, & evils of a
deluded, & deluding World! — I affectionately desire for thee,

of mind, & affecting situation of body, strikingly furnishes.
present my cordial, my tender love to her, if She be capable
