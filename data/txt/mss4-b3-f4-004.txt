Sheffield 1st month 16th 1782

Dear Sir
	I was not an ungrateful receiver of thy favor nor an I willing to omit a good opportunity of replying to it & especially to acknowledge thy tender care over the unguardedness of my pen  Writing and reading were amusements that for a few years of my life like the food of my mind, but proving it to be light, unsubstantial & bitter ^in^ fruition & a curse resting upon it, it became in the discoveries of light to be forbidden fruit which I neither dust nor did taste till I thought the relish was mercifully removed  but how lurking are our our [sic] propensations & how fatal may they prove even to minds wishing to feed upon that which is good? but which for want impartially enough scrutanizing [sic] into the infirmities of their frame are almost insensibly led to break the royal Law & with sacrilegious hands or in the lightness of human nature to touch & temporize with spiritual things; this greatly derogates from that true dignity & pure authority the Truth gives & even places the Princes of the people amongst the unfeeling multitude whose gathering is not to the holy standard & whose conversation is not coupled with fear  under these & similar considerations I have apprehended a fast proclaimed & through better help than my own I was enabled to attend to it & in some degree awfully to keep ^it^ but my fallibility is indisputable as is also my sensibility if I may be allowed thus to compliment myself for when I met with R Shackleton I felt what is unusual to me on so short an acquaintance the glow of near affection & a participation of supernatural joys, with these (as in days of old when the sons of God were met together) perhaps came the Ensnarer of my feet & acceptably gilded the bait  I indulged the genuine inclination of my heart & felt a secret warrant in finding so honored a Friend capable of receiving the like enjoyment  In the renewal of these impressions I wrote thee without seeking for the prescribed limitations or attending to the proclaimed fast & still I must say it was with the liberty of a Grandchild which I never took to any but thy self & now I consider that I am greatly indebted for thy timely admonitions & have in the submission due to my character & the deference due to thine to ask thy excuse & promise thee if thou wilt grant it that Ill endeavor in future not to exceed the limits of my Tether, not even to my beloved Friend R Shackleton
	I am glad of thy intention of bringing thy Daughters to see us in this land they will ^with^ their honoured Parent be welcome Guests into some of our habitations; I also take kind thy 
invitation & if best wisdom should ever conduct my steps to the borders of Ballitore I believe I shall not be satisfied without seeing its contents, but our future movements are best left to Him whose wisdom is a great deep.
	I am now on a visit to my Friends at Sheffield & likely to spend a few weeks amongst a valuable circle of them; Cousin Tabby took kind thy remembrance and desires her love  I am truly glad to hear that thy family is encreased & especially that my old Friend thy daughter Debby is in a fine way of recovery to whom please to present my love
	How deeply affecting is the recent loss of our two Friends upon that uncertain & unstable element  its a circumstance that will ^not^ bear reasoning upon, though silently instructive.
Remember me affectionately to they wife & daughters & allow me to subscribe myself thy affectionate & obliged Friend S. Tuke
