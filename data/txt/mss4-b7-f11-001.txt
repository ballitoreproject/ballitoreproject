My Dear Mr Ledbeater
I Hope you willnot be displeased at my intruding
a line on you, as Mary was obliged to go out, on an occasion not to
be dispensed with, at the moment she receivd your Letter - - She desir'd
me to tell you that she will do the utmost in her power to recommend the
distressed Woman for a [unclear]hearing[/unclear] and will be happy to succeed in her efforts
for that purpose — She also desires I would present her Love and
grateful thanks for all your kind remembrances, particularly the last
to little Maryanne — —
I gave your pathetic Representation of that poor afflicted
womans misfortunes, to Dorcas Fitzgerald who is ever active in
the cause of Humanity, and I hope she will be able to do something
amongst her Friends for her — poor Creature, hers is a case to
awaken compassion in any Breast capable of Feeling — but we find
but too many more ready to lament than to relieve — more ready to
admire the fine poetic Pen which paints her sorrows than to
administer that assistance which the Pen was employed to implore
for her — — perhaps it may not be universally the
case — I will hope so, and will mention the poor woman when I
think I may have any chance of succeeding — I beg you will give
my affecte. Regards to your good Brother & all that amiable Family and
tell him my little Arabella is safely over her Illness & has a healthy
fine Boy — — my good wishes attend your Family & I am yr admirer &
D Richardson
