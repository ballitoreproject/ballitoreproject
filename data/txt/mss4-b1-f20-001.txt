A Dream by Joseph Morris of Ridley 16th of 3 mo 1743
I thought I was at Aldermills in a Boat on the
River, & the Boat sunk; at which I leapt out, & got to the side,
where I saw a Grave & some People by it, at which I asked who it
was for, they answered [underline]for me[/underline]. Upon that I lay down by the
side of it & prayed & groaned, but they bid me not be afraid for
I should go to Heaven, then they put me into the Grave; after
which I thought God sounded his Trumpet, & we all arose at
the twinkle of an Eye, first the good & then the bad; & I saw a very
broad Way, & a very narrow Way with Gates to them both, & there
were many that went into the broad Way, & after they went
in, they seemed to go stumbling all the Way, & were clothed with
Patches. But I thought I followed Joshua Toft in the narrow
Way with some others whom I knew not clothed in Purple robes,
till we came into Heaven; but I saw the wicked were pushed into Hell
by the Devil with a Fork, & there was a River ran into Hell, & as it
ran it took Fire. When we came into Heaven, God opened a Book
& bid us read our Sins, Joshua's & mine were blotted out, Joshua's
were but few, & then he sat down in an high Seat, & I in one below it;
then an Angel brought a Crown & first marked Joshua's Head
and then mine, & said now yer are marked, & shall live for Ever; & I
thought there were some that seemed finer & in higher Seats than
some others, yet they did not despise them that were lower. After
that we went to the door of Heaven, & beheld the Devils pursuing
the Wicked; which was so frightful that it made us look another
Way, & God looked [insertion]on the wicked[/insertion] with anger, at which the Hills melted, &
there were vast tall Cedars & when he spake they bowed down
very low: upon which I awoke & was very sorry [underline]I was alive.[/underline]
He

He was about eleven Years old.
