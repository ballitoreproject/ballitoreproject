The washing seems to be all done on the river, floating Houses or
boats being very numerous full of washerwomen. I do not know how
they dry the clothes - for I have not seen any drying with one exception in
in one of the suburbs - the doing up & ironing seems to be all done by
different set of people who have shops or houses in every streets
when you can see numbers busily at work ironing plaiting &c &c
[deletion]they[/deletion] It is quite pleasant to see them so busy - generally speaking
The people here I think are more industrious than with us though
They also seem to take more pleasure & amusement of one kind
or another - The shops generally here are much smaller than with
us. but the comparatively little that is in them is more tartily laid
out - I enclose a letter from Emy to her Mamma which
I will be obliged by your putting in an
envelop & posting to Dunlavin - I have [unclear][/unclear]
stamp or I would enclose it too - I will also
be obliged by you telling Manliff with my love that I will thank
him to give Martha whatever money she may want until
our return - as I did not anticipate being so long away
when I left home & am sure she must be quite out of
cash - I hope she is not tired of housekeeping for me -
I want to try & get to the Post Office between the showers
so shall with dear love to all the dear ones conclude
hoping to have a good acct of Thos. to send next time
you may besure if he should be worse I will write at once
but I trust he will not - ever my dear Mother your affectionate
daughter EH
Thos & Emy send love also
