Ballitore 5th April 1822.-
Come lay by thy stichery my dear Sarah dost not
thou see I am come to spend a few minutes with
thee & to chat of old & new times or may hap
to vere with thee thro' shady groves by primrose 
banks that bloom so fair or by our own sweet
winding & twining Guise bright & gay & sweet
Thou didst wonder that I have been so long silent &
didst accuse the most innocent being in the world
of taking all my thoughts ah! fy Sarah! I did
not think thou could be so unjust. I might
tell thee what kept me so quiet but that it
would be taking up my sheet to no profit, for
shingles that spring like the grass in April
to put all ideas but those of ---- out of
my head - how I very generously leave this
[underline]dashing[/underline] blank for thee to fill as thou wilt
but I entreat it not to be any thing to the
disadvantage of any of thy Western friends.
But och hone! sure it is to a married woman
I am writing & I should be serious if not
solemn, sober if not sedate simple if not
silent & so on to the end of the [unclear]Ss's [deletion][/deletion][/unclear]
Thou art a married woman & therefor hast
Thou art a married woman & therefore hast
a husband - eh! is not this true? on my
veracity I take this to be a truism of the first

order - unless thou be a widow, which Heaven forbid
then this living & breathing husband (all alive & kicking)
must be my brother by the law of nations & [unclear][/unclear]
then give my dear love to my brother & assure
him that I often regret his [underline]visits[/underline] are over to the
valley - put "valley" before "are over" & the sentence
will read better. - But not to be joking to the
end of the chapter or rather sheet - let me tell
thee something of this said valley & tell thee
that thou art greatly missed out of it & by none
more than thy two disconsolate forsaken poor
ganders of sisters, Debs & Lids. My mother
is spending this day with the former of these
[underline]solitaries[/underline] & the latter thou knows what is
her soothing employment. These are marriages
[underline]they say[/underline], & deaths & births going on here
but they are amongst the poor despised race
the Lower Order so little heed is taken of them
however I have a penchant for this said Lower
Order may tell thee [unclear]that[/unclear] our John's mother
is dying of a consumption & that Margaret
Max is [underline]they say[/underline] going to marry a [unclear]Peeler[/unclear]
so be it I say & Amen too. - Poor Edward
Lennon is extremely ill nigh unto death
his illness the D[underline]r[/underline] says is inflamation in
the Bowels - and as it is inflamation I am in
hopes our dear little D[underline]r[/underline] will cure him as he
may bleed to his hearts' content. [underline]A - pro - pos[/underline] the

Dr's maid is coming to live with us as our poor
little dodleen Mary chooses to leave us or rather
her mother chuses to take her - I am mighty sorry
after Mary. Mary Shackleton is coming to spend
a few days with us as she has a heavy cold
& it is thought [deletion]that[/deletion] the lively company & affectionate
care of the Post Officers will be of use to her so far
her Patrician ill health - [underline] a-propos [/underline] I have
finished the first volume of Hooke & at the
same time demolished poor Coriolanus
dost thou remember our reading it & then
reading Shakespesr's version of the story Machere
I regret his stern fate but think he in some
degree deserved it. - I am endeavoring to trim
our bowers and hope to have them glorious
the 6.. th month _ delightful June I will call
thee my month of good omens ! Lucy Bewley
has got a sort a grotto made where her
summer house once stood _ it will be very
pretty when it is finished but for my part
I would rather have a simple seat under a
tree by the flowing water. Here come soldiers
well there is no help for misfortunes but resignation.
And I was swearing yesterday thou
wert either a month or 5 weeks gone from us
& lo ! they convinced me thou art but three
oh art thou but three away. Speed speed thou
Sun ye hours & thou stern Time that I
may hail my dear sister once more!

And tell me what thou art doing & whom art thou
seeing & write to me so that I may feel by thy
side where I was so long - but that is over & forever
Oh! but the crystal river of happiness runs
close by the inky flood of grief -- Dost thou remember
our slough of Despondence ? I will have
the profiles all ready for thee by the Yearly meeting
I expect - the weeping birch is living & I trust
it will be a beautiful tree & [deletion]by[/deletion] its mournful
branches will sweetly recall the dear departed
days of the years of old - laughing time what
will tears have to do with thy memory.
I fear Eliza will think me very neglectful not
to have written to her sooner but she must
& I know she will pardon me. Deborah is finely
& I think looks better than she has done this
long time but she will tell thee of her health
of herself & herself. Mary White & Thomas Henry
are well the latter thriving beyond any thing
I send thee the last fading sweets I could collect
in the garden -- The air is no longer perfumed
with their oders -- They have lost their smell
& a great deal of their beauty. However the
rose will soon make us forget the violets
modest grace & sweetness. Mary Anne Crickten
is married to Dr Halahan, but perhaps
thou hast heard this & that Jane & her
Husband are going to live in Naas- Ever
my dearest Sarah Thy affectionate [unclear]LBL[/unclear]

I have a few more words to say - a few! Goodness
knows if I have not a thousand. James desires
his love to thee & hopes to see in less than
two months. Hannah cannot come until
I dont know when. however I hope to see her
first here. Richard desires his love & would
thank thee to have the inclosed sent to
Wm Rayner. his news since from Thomas
Fisher Gay as I appear to be thy absence
weights heavily on me still oh! how often
I wish for thee, I am ... Didst thou ever
see on the old houses little head cherubs - well
substitute feather wings for their leader[unclear][/unclear]
ones & they with answer for a perspect [unclear][/unclear]
of my heart at present - however "repeat
no grievances" should be, is an excellent
maxim. I enclose a letter to Eliza &
a note to Emily who wrote to me. How
are John & c Richard J P J. M Doyle
is but little if any thing more cheerful.
I do not intend ever to let thee be so
long without having a letter from me
I will keep one always on the stocks
& as this is a ship building metaphor
thou may expect great ones
Farewell my dear Sarah I dream'd of thee
& Edward last night. it is pleasant to [unclear][/unclear]
I enclose 10d I suppose the
pencil lost that thanks
her getting it
Write soon very soon
to me I entreat.
