To Mary Leadbeater.
Darlington 30. 1. 1823.
My dear friend,
As thou art one of the earliest of the friends of my youth -
& one [deletion]from[/deletion] for whom I have always felt the highest respect & esteem, - & as I know thee
to have always [deletion]felt &[/deletion] shown an affectionate interest in my welfare, I think thou
has a just claim to [underline]early[/underline] information on a subject which so much concerns my
happiness as my matrimonial prospects. - Know then that proposals of marriage
from me have been accepted by Sarah Godler, - whose name will not be new to
thee. Although I cannot look upon our final union as an event which is very close
at hand, - yet I cannot but consider that all the circumstances attending this affair
have been more satisfactory & indeed more highly flattering to my feelings, than in
my most sanguine moments I could have anticipated. - We have had opportunities of
forming a previous intimacy of the closest kind, such as I believe very far cooperatively,
in similar circumstances possess; - the connexion has the unanimous & decided
approbation of our nearest relations & friends; - her character is very highly appreciated
by [underline]all[/underline] who are acquainted with her; - she possesses talents & attainments of the [unclear][/unclear]
order; - her consent has been obtained almost [underline]instantly[/underline] on demanding it & [unclear][/unclear]
in so frank & unreserved a manner as to be in the highest degree [unclear][/unclear]
my feelings. - On the subject of her disposition & mental qualities, - [unclear][/unclear]
ially be supposed that I cannot be an unprejudiced judge, but I [unclear][/unclear]
willing to leave it to the decision of any one who has the happiness of her acquaintance
& sure I am that it will be highly creditable to her. - In short - what have I
to wish for? - & what a number of things to claim my gratitude! - I have [unclear]been[/unclear]
since made her acquainted with Ballitore, - for the inhabitants of which she [unclear][/unclear]
the highest regard - & if ever we are favored to [deletion]p[/deletion] visit together the classic vale [unclear][/unclear]
will feel herself no stranger among you. She shares my feelings for you all, [unclear][/unclear]
it is with her express permission that I now inform thee of our engagement.
I am personally acquainted with the most of her relations, (& they are numerous)
from many of whom I have received much kindness, & particularly [deletion]for[/deletion] John
& Elizabeth Rickman, "those two invaluable friends" as she says herself "whom
next to my parents I most love & revere."
My present views as to a settlement in life are in the course of some three
or four years to establish a seminary in the south of England, in which I expect
no inconsiderable support from the exertions of the Rickmans & other relations & friends
of Sarah. I make use of my present situation as a means of acquiring some practical
experience in the art of teaching, as well as to add, as far as time will allow,
to my classical & other attainments. For such an establishment I think Sarah
is peculiarly qualified to be a mistress.
I have now pretty fully detailed to thee the [unclear][/unclear]
at purs [unclear]words missing[/unclear] me & shall I hope we long have the
pleasure of receiving thy congratulations thereon - in [unclear][/unclear]
[unclear][/unclear] am sure my [unclear][/unclear] will largely participate. We may by anticipation
consider outselves as thy nephew & niece do [unclear]sha[/unclear] any advice then might be pleased to bestow it on us
with filial respect.
Betsey Shackleton, as a highly valued friend, has my full permission to send the part of thos letter from [underline]me[/underline] to [underline]thee[/underline] it
is likely that I shall shortly address her myself on the subject and in the mean time shall be glad ro hear from her if she
inclines to write.- The letter to Lydia I allow thee to read - but should not like it to go further. -
Farewell - I am surrounded now by many school-boys - love to my Ballitore friends
Thy sincere friend
Thomas Fisher
now I am tempted to trespass on Dr F's sheet to tell you that the young man who is to teach in the class now
has arrived a pleasant intelligent man - he is looking for a church in Scotland, so I may still have hope to obtain his [unclear]situation[/unclear]
when I may conscientiously accept of it.- In the mean time; I will do my best to fit myself for it.- P. F. threatens to leave
in less than 3 years - I hope we may yet be together in the class room, & share the duties of it together. ---

F. Smith wishes very much to know James White (by the bye he found out an assistant for [unclear]him[/unclear] Ed

A Dr Fothergill who attended Dr Fisher,
a young man pleasant to speak to, & a

people of the town I have seen. A few

F Smith's sister is at present here on
a visit - she has dabbled with
Geometry & Latin, & Hebrew - Her
first question to me was about
Geometry. Neither Dr Fisher nor I

their fellow creatures, & obey
the call. Tell Betsey I long
for a letter from her. Remember

like her - conceited & stiff - & a pedant - this is perhaps a rash judgment - if so I will acknowledge
it. - A few days ago we had a public meeting in the evening, about 2 miles off - Dr. F. & I walked to it, a
beautiful frosty & moon-light night, the landscape around resplendent with snow - the meeting almost made me fancy
I was in the early days of apostle [unclear]ship[/unclear], where Wm Penn & Fox & the few met in fear & disgrace & suffered for the noblest
cause - it was held in a barn or rather [unclear]f[/unclear] - with logs of wood, boards &c for seats, a miserable looking stage upon
a tattered carpet, & farthen candles dimly [unclear]shining[/unclear] upon a motley audience of Yorkshire farmers, & servant girls, with a
few old women, & little children whom curiosity had brought - this contrasted with the equipage that brought the friends to the
miserable place made me thoroughly feel how powerful & sacred the call that forced them to leave the comforts & [unclear]honey[/unclear] of home
to come expose themselves to the rude gaze, & perhaps laughter of a coarse peasantry - I was anxious that they might needs
receive help in what I thought a very trying situation, & that their words might be favourably received, & not spoken in vain.
I believe I seldom prayed so sincerely as I did for them, at last a female Elizabeth Robson rose, [deletion]sister[/deletion] [insertion]cousin[/insertion] to Eliz. Rob. who was in
in Ireland & in beautiful simplicity expressed the pure gospel doctrine - the meeting concluded with two most impressive supplications.
I was much affected - then one of the friends an elderly man who had not spoken thanked the people for
their attendance, & [deletion]wished prayed[/deletion] hoped that this oppy may not have been granted in vain & Dr. F & I returned
My dear respected friend. if the sincere good wishes of a friend can be acceptable, at this trying
time of mixed joy and sorrow, anxious & yet cheerful anticipation of futurity receive them from me, for you
[unclear]and[/unclear] all your family remember me particularly to Lydia. I need not say that it would gratify me to be
in Ballitore at this time, to see once more one of the first & dearest of my friends there, before she leaves
the dear valley. I need not say either that Ballitore is still the same to me; that my thoughts still
turn to it as fond & spontaneously as before. The recollection of it is less alloyed by bitterness. I feel happiness
here [deletion]to[/deletion] in social enjoyment than in my dreary solitude in Glasgow. But the more I compare this place to B.
the more I feel the difference. I may not judge yet - having had no intercourse with any of the natives, but
I cannot yet conceive that I can ever become fully attached to any place like B. F. Smith is a man who pleases
me more the more I know him, but he is as different from [unclear]I. W.[/unclear] as can be, & tho' I cannot feel for him that veneration
which I have for my old master, I can talk to S. S. with much more freedom. He is frank & affable, tho' not what [unclear]would[/unclear]
be called a scholar, a man of very powerful & active mind, religious yet not a bigot, rather endeavouring to attain
than making a show of piety. His seeming good opinion of me has of course prejudiced me in his favour, for it is hard
not to think better of those who we [deletion]think[/deletion] have reason to believe think favourably of us. His wife, a pretty middle
aged woman is kind, not proud, but a woman of no pretensions to literature, without much mind, cold as English
people often are, or generally appear at first; a woman with whom I may live on friendly terms but not in friendship
His daughter is very different from Hannah giggling & light, with more abilities than real talent, more
memory than judgment & more self complacency than timidity, more quickness of apprehension than feeling.
A hebrew Latin Greek &c scholar she is going to begin Mathematics with me, & I hope she will make great
progress, for this reason though she has no liking from poetry. She also is a good drawer, but wants that
