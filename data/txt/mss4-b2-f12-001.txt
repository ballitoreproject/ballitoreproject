Dear Friend
Richard Shackleton/

	In simplicity but not in Insincerity I affectionately greet Thee with thy dear Connexions & others (as thou art free) of my Beloved friends & Copartners in Religious Labour in your Nation whether in or not in the the [sic] Ministerial Line of Service, unto all of whom I feel a nearness which time nor distance hath not canceled but frequently Revives with a comfortable fresh^n^ess in my mind as if in the present enjoyment of your Company wherewith I was many times Refreshed in my Travelling in Weakness amongst you.
	Oh! Beloved friends words cannot set forth the ardency of my wish for the prosperity of Truth in your favoured Nation nor express the consolation it affords me to hear that the Gospel seed sown in Tears amongst you, hath taken some Root, it reminds me of the Apostles words concerning the Resurrection it is sown in weakness, it is raised in Power, Fruits are apparent in Individual and let us hope that where the sign may not be so obvious it is operating in Hearts; I trust there is among you & us also a hiddin [sic] Remnant, like the Seven Thousand in Israel in Elijah Days. --- I do thankfully find & did when with you that the poor Ministers have helpers in Spirit, & am perswaded [sic] there are Arons & Hurs in our time whose reward is doubtless Equal to them that are in the Battle, real helpers in Christ & near to my Life
I often think no Cement is comparable to the Cementing Love of Truth by which we become indeed as Epistles written in one anothers Hearts Remembering each other when favoured to enter the Kings Court and have the Sceptre held out to us which I beleive [sic] is not always the case with even good minds, for we read the Lord trieth the Righteous &c I could Enlarge on that subject but am to consider to whom I am writing, one probably beyond me in Religious Experience although perhaps not in Christ before me who by the favour of an early Visitation have known good from my Childhood, but I doubt a more unprofitable Servant than many, and now am become of so little use as hardly entitled me to the Bounty of half pay yet the Master is still good, and I dare not keep the Little wholey [sic] to my self altho (I hope by the indulgence of Heaven) my distributions are of small extent cheifly [sic] at or near Home, and not finding as in time past my Mind Drawn to further distance, humbly hope I am Excused on account of Debility and thankfully Embrace the favour, yet feel for my dear friends in more remote Service particularly those of my own Sex Viz. the couple from you (supposed not returned from America) & our two English friends in your Nation, who I know are amongst very kind friends but am often thinking of (and others likewise) in affectionate Sympathy with their Exercises attendant on Travelling, and request Thou wouldst present my dear Love to them when opertunity [sic] offers. I dont liken them to such a poor timid Creature as my self yet Expect they are not without their Trials nor Consolations, for the Lords compasions [sic] fail not otherways I had sunk long ere this Day, or not been in a capacity to stammer forth feeling by his Praise. but [sic] I have many times thought that passage is verified among us, where it said, With Stammering Lips & another Tongue (than that of Eloquence) will He speak to &c -- and likewise of the Encouragement to faithfulness that is in another passage. The Tongue of the Stammerer shall be ready to Speak plainly, and in being sensible that we have such amongst us unto whom this Stammering Speaking is plainly perceived to be of to be of the Lord, who hath certainly a right to chuse his own Instruments and make use of even Rams Horns when he sees meet.
	Although writing is now dificult [sic] to me I have much Exceeded my first design of Expressing a little of my feelings &cand have yet to add on my dear Companion ^M:Rs^ behalf that She unites with me in these contents & intends answering the acceptable Letter wherewith Thou sometime since gratified her & me too in the perusal of it, at some future time; She being now closely Engaged in the Service of [seal] Religious visits to friends families in the compass of our Mo [seal] in which Visits when I have thought it my place to accompany [seal] been confirmed in beleif [sic] that her devotedness of Heart to her Masters Service has procured an apparent fitness for the present Engagement, and strikes me iwth an Application to my self of that saying The first shall be Last & the Last first. [sic no close quote] ---- now with hers & my Joint Salutation of Love to thine & Sons familys [sic] and many of our kind friends as if named particularly Joseph Williams & Wife &c I remain thy
	Friend & Sister in the Truth
		Sarah Crawley
Thou has doubtless heard before this time of the Release of our valuable Friend S. Taylor
Dear S: Spavold is yet continued with us, without much visible alteration in any respect of Late, if knew of my Writing would send Love to Thee &cwhereof he is full.
