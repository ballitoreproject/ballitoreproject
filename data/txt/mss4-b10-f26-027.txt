therefore quite in the dark about the fate of Glenageary. Tell Sally
Barrington if with you I am obliged for her share of the letter. I hope
I shall find you & everybody dear to us well on our return
Olivia & Kate look finely Kate has grown a good deal since
she left Ireland. There is no person in this Hotel who can speak
English so Kate is our interpreter for every thing. in all the other
Hotels there was English spoken not only by the Master but
several of the servants & when we were walking up to the
Castle of Heidleberg we were very much inspired by one
[unclear][/unclear] girls who had fruit to sell & [deletion]wh she[/deletion] from [unclear]wh[/unclear]
[unclear][/unclear]e bought some that she speaking to us in English
 [unclear]hen[/unclear] she found we were "English" - We are now
going out to the Botanical Gardens & some other places
This is a quieter town altho the residence of the Grand
Duke of Baden than any of the others we stopped at
It is comparatively new & I believe within a century
was all a Forest. The Palace is a larger but rather
a plain building - the grounds [insertion]or Gardens[/insertion] around it nicely
laid out & kept & a great variety of trees & shrubs in them
labelled as if in a Botanic Garden - [deletion]it has[/deletion] the town wants the
wealth Grandeur & picturesqueness of Frankfurt & the beautiful
& romantic neighbourhood of Heidleberg - any of my own
family who cares about us or our movement may see this
letter if they think it worth reading but I would wish as I said about
that it should be sent to Ricd or Elizth as I promised Elizth I would let
her hear from me & I found it impossible to write more than the one
letter at a time - indeed even to do so much I find it difficult to
recollect things or places in regular order - Tho & Emy join me in dear love
to you & all our near & dear ones - ever my dearest Mother, your affection
daughter E Henry
