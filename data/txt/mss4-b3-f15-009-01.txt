From the same to the same

Ballitore 15th of 2nd month 1784

Dear friend,
++My mind is many times prostrated in humble gratitude for the capital favour graciously vouchsafed to us of our poor children being, I hope, in a good degree preserved from the evils of the world: that the same good hand should not only have protected and shielded us who are parents from the arrows of our insidious, assiduous adversary, but that it should also be extending to the visiting and preserving of our offspring, is an unmerited kindness of the first magnitude. That we are also provide from day to day, by bounteous Providence, with the necessaries of this life, notwithstanding my retreat from business, and the situation of a great part of my personal property, is a favour, which bows my spirit in awful thankfulness. And my earnest desire is to be enabled to walk so as to be mercifully continued an object of divine regard & notice.
