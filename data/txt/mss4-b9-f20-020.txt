8th of 2nd mo 1828
My dear E - Betsy Barrington told me this day
that thou had return'd, I hasten to urge a very particular
& earnest request, which is that thou wilt
forthwith resign again the care of the Post Office
to Abby & put thy foot into the Retaliation
& let us see the hue if it were only for a week
Edw could then give thee [underline]advice[/underline] about thy ten[deletion]n[/deletion]ants
&c  - & thou would see W. Downes who came to Dublin
to see M Numan & is to stay two weeks, she wd
be delighted to see thee & surely seeing her
would be an inducement to thee to come
for my part I think it would be worth going
28 miles to see her, do come I know thou wd
enjoy thyself here with us the children are all
I may say in their best fashion Willy has
cut a double tooth & seems stronger & better
since, he is carried out every day that is fine
& is coming on, need I say any more to urge

my request I need not say how it would gratify
us all, for, I may include Mag:, to have thee here
to try to come let thy answer be thy self on first
day, WD is to spend seconday here, We are still very
anxious about our dear Emily altho' [insertion]she[/insertion] seems as if she
rallied again & hope is again revived but she
is so much reduced that she is more like a skeleton
than any thing else except her face which still
bears her own resemblance tho it looks quite long
I got a scrap from thee yesterday which is dated the
24th of last month I had the account thou alludes
to & I thought Edw had paid it however we can
settle this when thou comes & do come & bring with thee
some of Melecina's poems I wish to show Edw the "Ode
on the supposed death of [deletion]W[/deletion] Napoleon" I shall take
great care of all I get & also I long to see some
more of the precious journals I dont think I got further
than that which mentions my aunt Lydia's marriage
thou could bring me a few [insertion]coming[/insertion] after that one. I have much
quiet liesure after the children go to bed &
would be delighted to employ it in retracing the
steps of my darling mother's life, another request
I wd make is a loan of the first vol: of the
Annals, now if thou wd come & bring all these

treasures with thee I would be rejoiced besides I wd
like to hear something of my aunt Grubb, I hear
my aunt Sally enjoys going to visit thee which
must make thee more comfortable give my love
to her when thou sees her, I had a few lines
from Lydia, she is enjoying the prospect of
seeing E & D soon she was in great hopes thou
would have gone to Limerick, perhaps thou did
so, but how could thou accomplish so much with
any satisfaction in so short a time?, our winter
was pass'd if I may say it is over, in great
anxiety, in hope & fear indeed this state of sa[unclear][/unclear]
is not ended yet we cannot but fear till we perceive
returning strength, I hope to send D's medicines by
Betsy B. I have not yet got the recipe from the
Doctor he said he wish'd to make some little
alteration in it & would soon send it,
I was surprised to hear of the birth of Ellen Allen
is little Anne walking yet? I hope Ellen can nurse
my dear love to M D tell her I found the recipe
but that my mother thought with her that the
smell wd be too strong for Emily the other medicine
her stomack wd not bear but it is well
to have the recipe for it
