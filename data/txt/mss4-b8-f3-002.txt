Elizth Leadbeater
Ballitore
9th of 1830
My dear Eli th
I deliver'd thy message to
My aunt Gough who seem'd
gratified by it but said even
if she had got an invitation from
thee she could not have
call'd in Ballitore she & Mary
enjoy'd their visit to Carlow
very much they found a very
comfortable warm reception with
Ellen H & had the enjoyment of
meeting all the good [insertion]& great[/insertion] friends
there - I have been very much
[unclear]tired[/unclear] with a cold & all the
children are coughing in their
turn - I wish I could spend a
few days with thee, but at
present as the friends say
"[unclear]long[/unclear] does not open" however

the time may come. I think a
breath of fresh air wd serve
my health - my mother paid
us a pleasant little visit I
enjoy'd it very much Eben's
health seems better Lucy is
very well wast thou surprized
to hear of Betsy Allen Sam
[unclear]Tolston[/unclear] had a [unclear]lively[/unclear] choice
Sarah Phelps paid me a visit
a few days ago Margt & Johnny
were in the room at the
time playing on the sofa on
which I sat & teazing me as they
[insertion]thought[/insertion] I wd not quarrel with them
before strangers - so that it
was hard for SP to deliver
herself of her good advice
it was given in a kind of [unclear]conversation[/unclear]
in which I join'd
in parting we both stood
up she still giving her advice
in a still more religious strain
talking of the Query "is there
any growth in the [unclear]truth[/unclear]"
when Jonny's spirits quite
got the better of him - & she
& he jump'd up on my
back - I slipt him off as
quietly as I could while
I was shaking hands & with
my kind adviser the most
difficult task was to preserve
a sedate countenance
I have told all my news
so farwel thy SB
