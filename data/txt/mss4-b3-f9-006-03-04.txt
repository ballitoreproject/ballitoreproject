From the same to the same

Ballitore: 28/11 month 1773

Dear Cousin,

	+++ Thou desires [sic] intelligence about the half-years meeting from me. I apprehend that I am not well at details of this sort; even when on the spot, & during the succession of meetings, one meeting as it were puts one another out of my memory. Indeed I do not much regret this defect, for as we are but creatures of a moment, the making good use of the present opportunity is our only true interest, as well as duty. This meeting has been to me I think much as I think they have mostly been to poor me for twenty five years past. In many of the sittings my mind has been prostrated, & my spirit deeply baptize, I hope by the right operation & power; but of this I would speak with caution, though of my own feelings: because great & deep is the mystery of the enemys workings, & our own imaginations & passions may effect the same in appearance as the true angel of light, who only troubleth the waters (puts i motion the inward exercise) so as to cause any salutary virtue. To me it seems as if though the Lord Almighty was still extending his call, & hovering over for good: the testimony of Truth through well-qualified instruments was sharp & piercing, & in general things ni my apprehension much in the same state as they have been of late years. Our little Friend, who appeared at Enniscorthy, appeared also at our Provincial Meeting in Dublin, but most of our Elders [page number] 174 seeming dissatisfied with him, an opportunity was taken with him in solid conference, & we heard him no more. This is subtle, nice work, dear friend, & requires much skill, deep experience, a clear head, wise heart & bowels of Christian sympathy: so that I am ready to say, who is sufficient for this thing? And if there be any service in religious society out of which I would willingly slip my neck, I think sometimes it is this. Christ Jesus, the head of his Church, has only the power of formation, & the right of sending forth his ministers. They should therefore be well assured that they have along with them the mind of the his Spirit who judge in these matters. ++++
	Our kind love & good wishes attend thy brother Willy & his spouse: we are pleased to hear so agreeable report of them, & hope they will wisely choose the one thing needful, the good pact, which they will find to be the best resource & support to the mind through the dangers & difficulties of life, & which, if kept on board & suffered to manage the helm, will pilot their vessels aright, & land them safe in a better country.
