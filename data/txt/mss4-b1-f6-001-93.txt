- You do not mention in your account the Interest due
on the principle sum of Â£140..16..4: for whomsoever
becomes the purchaser will expect both: having now said
all I think or can advise on the subject, I have but to repeat
that every means in my power shall be at all times exerted
towards the completion of your wishes in this business, &
if my brother was to die [insertion]intestate[/insertion], I shou'd most certainly see you paid the
last farthing: Mrs. Eyre desires her compliments to yr. self
& family.
And believe me Dear Sir
very Sincerely & Affectionately
Yr. Thos. Eyre
Capt. 35th Regt.
P. S.
As this letter might get into other hands, I beg you will commit
it to the flames, as soon as you have perus'd it.
