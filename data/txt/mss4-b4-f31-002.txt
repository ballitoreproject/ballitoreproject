Richmond 6 Oct 1826
My dear Eben
I do not think I
have any thing particular to say
but that Miss [unclear]Unthank[/unclear] is going
to take this to Ballitore & that I
did not write to you by Wm
Harvey - two pieces of information
wch you will know how to prize -
Will you know I am about to
put to sea again not liking the
harbour I have been anchored in
these some years, and fate as uncertain
as the wind is to blow
me to some other - I had better
keep at sea a while than venture
on a lee shore - Tell Dick there

are several mills to be let now
about here - one near Nenagh about
20 miles from this near the Dublin
road - one 12 miles to the west
near Rathkeale Co Limerick, advertized
as capable of working an overshot
wheel - one at OBriens Bridge
close to the Shannon 6 miles from
this Co Clare but no great thing -
Let him come here & see for himself
and ask me to join him - I would
willingly be made one of the craft.
Meantime I am dabbling in Linens
& Insurances for although the St
Patrick is gone the way of all Saints
I still continue to do a little with
the other two companies as broker
or [underline]go-between[/underline] - I am with uncle
James still until I wind up our
joint accts. - Lydia will not
consent to come with me into one
of the [underline]Squares[/underline] & [underline]co-operate[/underline], although
we might there be [underline]so[/underline] happy!! -
Sally is going to the North - she
accompanies this letter as far as
Kildare - we are sorry to hear that
your good Doctor is threatening to
leave you - He will be a sad
loss to rich & poor - Do you receive
the Examiner safe? It is pleasanter
now to read facts - pleasanter!! no
I mean that the mind cannot
my mind cannot come to conclusions
on the present situation
of the labouring classes - I satisfy
myself with reading facts & wondering
what will happen - I can
guess what will be nor what ou
be
Yours ever J. J.
so so indeed
[unclear]2020[/unclear] indeed
