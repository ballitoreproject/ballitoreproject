According to my Arabella's request, I begin on a separate
paper to answer that part of thy letter, which I was
prevented doing the last time I wrote. I shall begin where
thou does: there thou tells me that thy Mother [insertion]( thou[/insertion] think) will
not be like to pay a visit to Ballitore: this is news very unwelcome
& I wish that thou may be disappointed in thy
fears; do not blame me for wishing thee a disappointment;
for I hope it would not be a disagreeable one: I am sensible
that the loss of so tender a Parent as thine was, & so gone an example
must be very great; but, my dear we should not tax the divine
disposal, but consider that "what ever is, is right," not that I
would pretend to imagine that one must stifle the emotions of nature
which it is impossible to do, & thou thyself ( I am confident)
considers the kindness of Providence in sparing thee thy Mother &
thy Aunt -- I do not wonder, if thou shudder at the idea of the
danger she has escaped. Thou art very welcome to communicate
thy grief to me; it is the duty of a Friend to administer comfort,
which I will do, as far as is in my power. But I should thank thee
for thy parody, which thou wert so kind as to send me, & do not forget
thy promise of sending me any of thy poetical performances
which thou may at times compose for thy amusement, & I shall take
it as a proof of that affection thou art so kind as to profess for
me; & I cannot but think thou must compose pretty often as thou
hast a turn that way, & to any that have I think it must come
quite natural when alone to amuse themselves that way, we
always have a fund of entertainment in ourselves to divert
solitude, if the mind is not stained with guilt; but if it is, solitude
is insupportable, & heart-corroding reflections prey on both
mind & body. May this my dear Bell, never be the case with
thee, as thy Friend ! I hope it never will, we have a kind &
merciful Father, who if we look to him aright, will guide & protect
us through every toilsome path & intricate labyrinth in this
vale of wo, though as yet I cannot call it so by experience: for I
have had little of it's sorrows, for which I wish I was truly
thankful: I am sorry that any portion of its sorrow has fallen
to thy lot, & made thee at so early an age out of conceit with it

I can hardly think (but do not doubt thy veracity) that thou art
so in love with solitude as to prefer it to the amusements of town;
but not doubt thou views' (by the light of reason & sense) these
amusements in a proper light, that they draw the mind from
what it should be fixed on, & carry it away on the wings of vanity
drowning all serious reflection, making the mind giddy with
diversion, & unfit to judge for itself or to see the ruin to which
with hasty & joyful steps it is approaching; & in those few
moments when it [underline]can[/underline] think, it finds nothing pleasing in the
reflection, & in the end bitterly laments the loss of time so
foolishly spent in the pursuit of a bubble: as the manner in
which I am educated, & the rules of our society afford no room
for my knowledge of it, I cannot speak from experience, but from
what I hear & imagine: tell me dost thou coincide with my opinion?
I think a cheerful, agreeable neighbourhood, domestick harmony
& improving friends are preferable to any thing else, I add
a self-approving mind, conscious of being right; may we, my dear,
experience this: 'tis the best wish I can give my friend, could
wishes avail. Thou, says, "I will think thee romantick", forgive
me if I do, a little; but thy youth & lively imagination are an
ample excuse, & I doubt not, when judgment has matured a
good understanding, that my dear Bell will be a shining
Woman; especially if Humility, the ornament of every virtue
be joined with superior accomplishments; without this nothing
can please; it is the salt, which preserves the other virtues from
decay. Why is the Violet so beloved? with its sweetness it adds
Humility. Think not, my dear Bell, that I mean to accuse
thee of Pride, or judge myself capable of advising: I am much
wronged, if thou harbours' such a thought; I only speak my sentiments
with the sincerity which on friend should use to another
& which I though would be agreeable to thee; without sincerity,
Friendship is nothing. I should not be so free in communicating
my sentiments to thee, did I not rely on thy not shewing
this to any; thy concern lest thy Mother should feel by the
remembrance of her loss is very laudable; we should avoid paining
those to whom our obligations are so many, & so great an
obedience is due; very blameable will we be if by word or action
we cause them a pang, & will most certainly incur the divine displeasure

I wonder thou would be backward in shewing thy
performance, I should be very ridiculous if I criticized on anothers
compositions when my own afforded a much larger field
for criticism.
My pen grows bad & my time is shortened; therefore
let me now take my leave, & do not be offended at or put
any wrong construction on what I have wrote; but remember
that sincerity is the characteristick of a friend
