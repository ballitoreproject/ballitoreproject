My dear Elizabeth - I don't know whether thou may
have heard of Wm. Lefanu's illness, I believe [deletion]that[/deletion] it was
a brain fever which lasted more than two weeks & [deletion]we[/deletion]
[deletion]had[/deletion] every account [underline]that[/underline] came to us told us of [insertion]his[/insertion] getting
better, till on [deletion]first day[/deletion] [insertion]yesterday[/insertion] we received by a hurried
letter from Mary, the melancholy account of his
death, as yet we have heard no particulars but
expect Mary home tomorrow, we are all sadly
sunk at this most grievous loss, & we can think
of nothing [insertion]at present[/insertion] but what tends to aggravate our distress
but we hope in a short time the [unclear]assurance[/unclear]
of his eternal happiness will console us,
My mother thought thou might better
have this soon lest thou should meet the
intelligence in a news paper or that our
meeting might be embitter'd by it, for Betsy
& I have concluded to meet thee at Enniscorthy
she intends going from thense to Clogheen &
it is intended that thou should come back
in her seat on my fathers case we are to have
a hired house & our own boy John to drive us-

I will leave all domestic news till we meet as
I have not spirits to go on with this Farewell my
dear Elizabeth sorrow binds souls nearer & nearer
ever thine SL
