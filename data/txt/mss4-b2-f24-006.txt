My dear Fathers very agreeable favour I received; we were become very jealous at not hearing from you sooner, as we had information from Dublin of sister Lydias delivery several days before it came from you, Sam was surprised that Molly Pemberton should be the means of our having account of so interesting an event in the family, & really we looked something silly to have our neighbours telling us the news, ^one^ after another, & then querying. Had you no letter? but it seems your letters were detained: we are truly pleased to hear our poor sister is over this trying, distressing Season, I thought by my dreams twould soon be over, the time was hard, 13 hours is a long time, a sore conflict! may [sic] we evern look up with thankful hearts to that power that enabled poor, weak Woman to get thro such bitter pangs: I hope sister will not be discouraged at her milk not coming immediately, sister Sally Johns was long coming, & the child hard set to grasp the Nipple, & now she makes a fine Nurse: if sister could get some healthy young *child older & stouter than her own to suck her twould be better, & more efficacious in forwarding the suck than an old mouth, has she a glass to draw the suck? those are useful: it is easier for her not to have the suck flow too much at once before she gathers strength, the great quantity I had at first seemed to make me weak & uneasy. I hope sister will be incouraged [sic] to wait a while for her suck, & not be too hasty in procuring a hired Mother for the sweet Babe, & be perplexed with the Nurses [sic] families after: I hope the child is fed with spoon, & that you will be very careful of my dear little NephewMolly Dudley just gone, she came to sit a while with me, which interruption (tho I love her company) was not acceptable* at this time, I shewed her thy letter, she desired her dear love to you, & expressed her partaking with us of the joy attending the addition to the Shackleton family. I just received a note from sister Sally John, she says. I long much to know whether my dear Lydia is capable of suckling her precious Boy: I can sympathize with her in this state of uncertainty. Thy good Fathers letter I wish to see when we meet. I wish much to go to Castledermot meeting, but am apprehensive my husband will be afraid to venture me as I have been so long confined, & am still a prisoner above stairs, tho much relieved of my hoarseness, cough & sore throat, the latter [word crossed out] ^was^ but slight, my Mothers receipt I believe helped me. I received my sisters [sic] letter & the enclosed receipts for Johny [sic] Pim, which I intend forwarding to him tomorrow, being our 6 weeks meeting. I had begun a letter to E: Pike before the Quarterly meeting here, but did not finish it till to day [sic], my eyes were tender & head affected by the cold. I intended acknowledging thy kindness in sending me the poem on Ballitore: & when I wrote thought I had something to mention, stopped writing, & endeavoured to recollect what, but could not remember, this is the cause of that omission. I am much obliged by my Mothers being desirous I should be particular about mentioning the Children, when they are sick I generally complain, but when well I am silent, I almost fear to say they are well, their health is so very uncertain, but thro great favour I never knew them better. Anne runs alone quite stout, talks very plain for her age, & looks as blooming as a country Damsel, has four small & two double teeth, Abraham become plump & firm in his flesh, is sprightly & bold, has dropped sleeping by day, & can say all his great letters, except I which he cannot pronounce, but knows it well in the book. I think he has got all his teeth. So much for this little subject. I am pleased to hear poor Cousin Sam is likely to mend, my dear love attends him, & the family he is with. It is very pleasing to hear of Thomas Collys safe return. I am pleased to hear sister Sally is recovering.
	We were comforted with the account thou gives of your visit to Moat, when I perused it I thought of those lines ^written^ by Pope. Explores the lost, the wandering Sheep directs speaking of the Fatherly care of the Great Shepherd in bringing home the st^r^ayed sheep, & surely those who are his real servants are clothed with something of the same restoring, gathering spirit, & not by an ill tempered zeal & austere conduct, drive farther from the fold of safety. It was a pity the friends were beguiled into the affair. I did not hear much talk [work crossed out] of it here, I think none at all, but just my Husband told me when he came home what he heard in Dublin.
	I hope we shall often hear how Sister Lydia goes on. Abrahams Nurse has had great trouble in her family, & consequently we have had our share of it: as we seem to be the only outward succour she has in distress, her Husband & two of her children so ill as to expect their Death, one child died, the other & her Husband she hopes is recovering, she has but one bed, therefore has not taken off her clothes I suppose these 3 weeks, 7 was a while she could ^not^ lie down to rest any way, 18 nights she said (two nights excepted.) we [sic] supply them with money &c. for their support, her Husband combed wool for us: it is a great ease to me that I was inabled [sic] to nurse Anne: tho I sometimes think it was ordered by Providence that I could not nurse Abraham for poor Nurses sake, who seemed to be destitute friendless, & an object of great pity: & the care of a merciful Providence is over all his works: so that I do not regret my inability to suckle him. It was Abrahams foster sister that died: a pretty child, the other Child is sucking. Brother Jos family well, sister expects (like Molly Dickinson) confinement & encrease in the 2nd month: sister ^(John)^ had a letter lately from MollyI pity poor Molly Roberts. My dear love & duty attends you joined by Samuel
	your affectionate

*Sam highly disapproves my venturing to write this. I ment [sic] I was intent on writing, & would chuse not to be distubred just then

sister Sally John did so, & then put her own child directly to the breast after the other
