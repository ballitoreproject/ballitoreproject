The Vision of John Woolman.
23rd.. of 8th.. mo: 1772. Being now at the house of George
Crossfield[deletion]s[/deletion] in Westmoreland County, I feel a concern to
commit to writing that which to me hath been a case
uncommon - In a time of sickness with the pleurisy,
a little upwards of two years & an half ago, I was brought
so near the gates of death that I forgot my name. Being
[insertion]then[/insertion] desirous to know who I was, I saw a mass of matter
of a dull gloomy color, between the South & the East,
& was informed that this mass was human beings,
in as great misery as they could be & live, & that I
was mixed in with them, & henceforth might not consider
myself as a distinct, or separate being: in this state I
remained several hours: I then heard a soft, melodious
voice, more pure & harmonious than any voice I had
heard with my ears before, & I believed it was the voice
of an Angel, who spake to other Angels: the words were,
"John Woolman is dead". I soon remembered I once was
John Woolman, & being assured that I was alive in the
body, I greatly wondered what that heavenly voice could
mean. I believed beyond doubting that it was the voice
of an holy Angel; but as yet it was a mystery to me.
I was then carried in spirit to the mines, where poor oppressed
people were digging rich treasures for those called
Christians, & heard them blaspheme the name of Christ: at

at which I was grieved; for his name to me was precious.
Then I was informed that those heathens were told
that those who oppressed them were the followers of Christ,
& they said amongst themselves if Christ directed them
to use us in this sort, then Christ is a cruel tyrant.
All this while the song of the Angel remained a
mystery: & in the morning my dear Wife & some others
coming to my bed-side I asked them if they knew who
I was, & they telling I was John Woolman, thought I
was only light-headed; for I told them not what the
Angel said, nor was I disposed to talk much to any
one, but was very desirous to get so deep that I might
understand this mystery. My tongue was often so dry
that I could not speak till I had moved it about
& gathered some moisture: & as I lay still for a time
at length I felt divine power prepare my mouth that
I could speak, & then I said, "I am crucified with Christ,
"nevertheless I live, yet not I, but Christ that liveth
"in me, & the life that I now live in the flesh is by
"Faith in the son of God, who loved me & gave himself
"for me". Then the mystery was open, & I perceived there
was joy in heaven over a sinner that had repented,
& that that language, "John Woolman is dead", meant no
more than the death of my own will.
Soon after this I coughed, & raised much bloody matter,

which I had not during this vision, & now my
natural understanding returned as before.
Here I saw that people getting silver vessels to
set off their tables at entertainments was often stained
with worldly [deletion]f[/deletion] & that in the present state of things
I should take heed how [deletion][/deletion] myself from out of silver
vessels.
Soon after my recovery I going to our Monthly
[deletion][/deletion] dined at a Friend's house where drink was
brought [deletion][/deletion] vessels & not in any other, & wanting
some drink told him my case with weeping - The
like I went through in several Friends' houses in
America, & have also in England since I came here,
& have cause with humble reverence to acknowledge
the loving-kindness of my heavenly Father, who
hath preserved me in such a tender frame of mind
that none I believe have ever been offended at what
I said on that occasion.
After this sickness, I spake no more in publick
Meetings for Worship for near one year; but my
mind was very often in company with the oppressed
Slaves as I sat in Meetings; & thoâ€™ under this
dispensation I was shut up from speaking, yet
the spring of the Gospel-Ministry was many times
lovingly opened in me, & the divine gift operated by
abundance of weeping, in feeling the oppression of this people.

people
It being now so long since I past through this
dispensation, & the matter remaining fresh & livingly
in my mind, I believe it safest for me to write it.
Signed,
John Woolman.
