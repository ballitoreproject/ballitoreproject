Ballitore 17th of 12th mo 1812
My dear sister
It was only yesterday I received thy
truly acceptable [insertion]letter[/insertion] with the books for which
we are all very much obliged & Lydia & I can
read the french ones pretty easily I delivered
thy love to most of the people thou
sent it to among the rest Mary Kelly [insertion]was of course[/insertion] [deletion]she[/deletion]
pour I forth a volley of blessings.
I long to see thee & expect I will at the Quarterly
meeting. I will now tell thee of my lessons
since Deborah left us I hav'nt got one except
one french one but thy entertaing little
book will induce me to read more french I
have entirely left off Ital[deletion]l[/deletion]ian, [deletion]but[/deletion] I hear Lydia
& Mary Ann their lessons almost every day
10d & in answer I believe it would be sold for 16d
My father says it would be very wrong to [deletion]to[/deletion] send
thy trunk by [insertion]the[/insertion] boat as there would be great danger
in losing it & it would cost as much [unclear]striving[/unclear] to get
it there as it would to bring it in the coach - My
mother had a letter from my aunt yesterday
she can give the & me a bed in her own room so I
expect it won't inconvenience her F. Bewley is
to lodge there too. I wonder where we will meet
in Carlow & will I know thee I am longing for
the happy hour I must bid the Adieu now
Thine S L
I intend to send Madoc from Carlow. Bring [unclear][/unclear] &c except
dear Betty Grubb wishes to keep it. Thy father daily mending, but
has given up going to Carlow changing his bed & long sittings are not fit
for him.

dont be frighten'd to hear I get no lessons
now & think it will be very hard to make
me begin again for I intend to be very attentive
so thou sees I expect to yoke thee into
the plough of learning once more which I
hope will not be too heavy for thee to push
along I saw Jane Williams to day & gave
thy love to her for which she was very
grateful & glad to see thou had not forgot
any of them "tho' coaches & all between" I suppose
thou know we have got Nancy again who
ran away but once since she came last.
we have got a new loger & are to get a new
girl as Bess is to leave us her uncle died
lately & desired her to live with her aunt
so as it was her uncles last request she must
go, so we will [insertion]be[/insertion] all new by thy return
17th Just received thine, my dear Eliz:, Thy father was confined to his
bed three days, & yet to the house mostly, tho' he walks out at times in
the day, & would often but for the weather. I believe his complaint was
rheumatic & bilious. But thou may be quite at ease now about him.
By all means let Sally Davis have half of thy bed. I intend to write to
night to thy Aunt, who will make way for you & Sarah also I expect, either
with herself or Frank. She has agreed to let two rooms to F & Fanny for
the meeting. I shall warn thy Aunt of thy arrival. Where the Coach stops is
nearly opposite Frank's. Don't ask them to stop at thy Aunts' because of thy
luggage. Lest thou could not get a seat at the day appointed would it not
be best to take one before? Wm. Goodwin had to pay to Dublin a [unclear]che a real[/unclear] would
not be engaged him. If thou could get company to part it, that would be the best
way of getting thyself & trunks - perhaps from Clonmel a friend or two might be
coming. Eliza Duckett was at meeting at Carlow last 1st. day I hear. I believe
her daughter has no music master. I did not do any thing since about thy
watch, wishing us to confer about it. I hope thy dear Uncle may get better
George finely. I endeavour to put from me the pleasure thy return promises
because all our pleasures are so uncertain. I hear nothing of Agnes &c. J o Beoine
is in Scotland I suppose.

I wonder thou would say thou'rt growing
old in ignorance tis as if thou were fishing
for compliments as for thy latin [unclear]thou[/unclear]
[insertion]those [deletion]copper from Aby[/delection][/insertion] thou can pull up all thy losses when thou comes
home. If I should ever go to school (which
I fear is doubtful) I would not like to go very
ignorant either as it would be shameful
to be so much worse than thee & Deborah
I did not see Mary Davis since [unclear]but[/unclear]
will deliver thy message the next time I
so We dont know who the boy is that told
us of Richard he says his name is Brown
& we think he's [deletion]one of[/deletion] JB's son of Bert near
Athy as he had a son at school in England
I cannot tell thee much of the Mistress
or Lucy I suppose thou heard of her &
Chandling. Jane F bids me give her love to
Thy relations & friends have been very kind to thee, I hope thou will
retain a sense of it, & manifest it by indeavouring to deserve it. We are grateful
to them, especially to thy dear uncle & aunt, who are like parents to thee.
Thy Aunt Chandlee hopes thou will excuse her writing till she is in a
more sprightly humour. She has a very sore finger & her breathing has
been affected. but rather better. Thy Uncle C. not worse. Our new girl is
not to come home till after the meeting. I wish thou should have
the directing of her, as thou must have learnt from thy Aunt
many things. We have not parted John, but got another Boy who
does not lodge here. Our dear love is to you all thine dearly
M Leadbeater.
We waited to announce the arrival of the packet
I hope our silence did not make thee uneasy.
Poor Sally Walsh almost gone.

to thee & tell thee she is very much obliged to
the for her book she is here now prattling
away at a great rate. Deborah is quite well
now & comes out almost every day.
Mary S [insertion]spent [deletion]the day[/deletion] yesterday[/insertion] [deletion][/deletion] with us & Betsy drank
tea here Mary is now making ridicules for [unclear][/unclear] 
& has died straw different colour for them
she sends them to Carlow to sell for her
so thou can see some of them at the meeting
Thy trade is going on pretty well we are
buying [deletion]straw[/deletion] [insertion]plait[/insertion] almost every day I fear
thou wilt thing we have too much but
they give it so much cheaper now than
in summer that we cant get over
taking it from the people. I got some
a few days ago [insertion]for 6d per dozen[/insertion] that Mary thinks was worth
I am just came
from E B's where
I spent the evening
and got M Pike
to make a bonnet
for me she sends
her dear love to
thee & would have
written to thee if she
had but intends
to do so before thou
comes here.
E Little sends her
love to thee.
I forgot to tell thee
[insertion]neither[/insertion] the Doctor or P
Fitzsimmons are
removed yet

To Morrow!!!
