My dear E
I hope thou got the
blankets & paper the
blankets cost 30s/- they
are a very good pair I hope
my father did not think
them dear - thou paid
me one shilling too much
on R Webb's account I paid
4/6 for the paper so thou
owes me only 3/6 the paper
went in Eben's soap box
I believe - we are all
well here except Edw who is
still complaining a little
give my dear love to Abby
I hope she is getting better
Jane Malone takes this

& I hope will bring me intelligence
of you all in return her feelings
will be tried on going to Ballitore
she has suffer'd so much
since she was there she
goes to see Willy Butler
who I hear is not expected
to live much longer he
wish'd to see his aunt
how does poor Mary Doyle hold
out? She must be greatly
overdone if she keeps the shop
open - G & W Downes purpose
going to Ballitore early next week
I hear some talk of Mary Newman's
accompanying them - M
Chambers seems very low
her spirits [deletion]& patience[/deletion] are
almost exhausted & no [unclear][/unclear]
after lying 12 weeks in an
uneasy bed - my nurse call'd
to see me & brought a good
account of you she said thou
gave Ally's child a frock "&
wasnt that mighty good entirely
of her" - the Nephew's are
still at Dalkey they have
6 children & two gentlemen
lodging there & seem pretty
well contented Jane is getting
strong again she is never [unclear]still[/unclear]
in warm weather, Grattan
has some expectation of being
taken to France with the family
with whom she resides, she
is much more comfortable
[deletion]than[/deletion] now than she was
at first - I go to put Marg to
bed so adieu
