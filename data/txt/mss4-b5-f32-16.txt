Anner Mills 2nd of 2nd mo 1822
My dear M.L.,
A strange incoherent letter
was sent to thee by post about two weeks ago
which I regretted, but our son Barclay, not finding
a conveyance thought he had better not disappoint
me by bringing it home. - I have this day a letter
from my kind [unclear][deletion]Meyou[/deletion][/unclear] Hannah from which thou
shall have the following extract "I have now
allotted the following three weeks to the "Shackleton memoirs"
I find in order to accomplish what our
dear A. Pim had commenced & actually proceeded in
as far as 1/3 leaving scattered remarks further on
I must not allow myself to be diverted therefrom
I, and I am sure you, will feel for the author in
the detention already incurred - and I feel bound
if ability be continued to get through the whole
that it may be correctly printed - we have commenced
[insertion]re [/insertion]copying that which is retained. I have
written twice to Mary Leadbeater -- and wish
her to be informed that [underline]I do not object to paying[/underline]
[underline]portage[/underline] - and it would be encour[insertion]a[/insertion]ging to know
that she approves of what I have done - as well
as that it is right, that my promptness should be
checked - if she disapproved - I am anxious to get the

the work to press - that it may be out before yearly
Meeting"
My endeared brother Richardson is with us
since third day. he purposes leaving this on
second day & has offered to drop this letter in
Athy. we were disappointed this week our
valued Aunt M. G was too poorly to attend
monthly meeting. Sarah Fernell & her sister Jane
were both ill in Cork so that we appeared to
have a reduced gathering. I just spoke
to Dinah White in the meeting house but
to Dinah White in the meeting house, but
hope we shall have some of her company - we
were treated by her sister Sally's visit to us
Joseph & she are great friends. . I think that
Edward would induce thee to favour
him with a few lines of poetry - he is a
sweet [underline]pet[/underline].. I do not wish to infringe on thy
time which must now have full occupation,
but I just thought of asking thee what the terms
of James White's school are.. I cannot conveniently
add as much [insertion]as[/insertion] I should wish but request
your individual acceptance of cordial love
thy truly affect. E. Clibbon
