Richmond 8/3 - 1828
My dear Deborah & Sarah -
I have most delightful accounts to
send you of Lydia and her little "sweet William"-
I never knew her so well after a confinement,
having no alloy or draw back of any [underline]kind[/underline] whatever.
She has been in the drawing room these two days,
and is to dine with us today - Willie is a pretty
child & very large - if we are to judge by the
sleeves that Jozy wore when his age he is a [underline]larger[/underline]
child - at this rate what will the world come to -
are we to have a race of giants the next generation?
Alas. I cannot give you many of the childrens
wise or witty sayings - my very brains are addled
with thinking about education & trying [unclear]to make[/unclear]
that path smooth, which formerly we were
told [underline]must[/underline] be rough - I think I have succeedd
admirably as head nursetender - but not [unclear]true[/unclear]
be the credit, for I think there could not be a much
worse tender of the sick than I - no most humility
either in the speech - How I should enjoy myself
My dear Sab - Ay! I got your message. [unclear]assent [/unclear]the earthenware - I
could have no idea you intended to take such an advantage of us
- now are you not a little unreasonable, after making on your
debtors so many times by catering for our wants, you fling this
large gift into the scale - are you not afraid that our gratitude
will kick the beam or that your last weight may be like the
sword of Brennus & destroy the compact - Well I am sure we
thank you heartily & accept your magnificent gift as it is
offered as a token of your regard - I now not add to what
Sally says about Lydia - I regret that this letter was delayed
so long as I know you will have been so anxious about
Lydia - She says she will be very careful of herself & I expect she
will soon be stout again - We are going to dispatch Sally & Charlotte
to the sea side as soon as we can dispense with them - My father
is going to - so we shall be left alone [underline]with[/underline] our glory viz 4 bairns
what an awful number - No 2 is lurking at my elbow until I
can scarce write - You rogue you did not let me know who

in that beautiful country with you - but it seems
always my lot to miss the Co. Wicklow. - however
I hope some future time I shall be more fortunate
I wish you had pleasenter weather - really this
is dismal - the farmers are in the vapours.
Hannah Harvey is, we hear much better,
and not at all troubled with nervousness
since I left her; I am very sorry Sarah always
misses her - & Deborah too I am sure she would
be very glad to see. We have not made
out Griffin yet - but were promised by his
cousin that he should be brought breakfast
with us - but the assizes are over & so
I suppose he is gone; & that he did not choose
to be [unclear]expedited[/unclear] like a wild beast.
Sarah - thou always put off they visit - from
summer to [deletion]winter[/deletion] [insertion]autumn[/insertion] from [deletion]winter to[/deletion] autumn to
winter - I hope not from winter again to spring
tho' that little bit of pretty counting we have
would look to more advantage thereof - it is
like the children promising to be good -
I'll be good tomorrow - but alas! The tomorrow
keeps in the distance - we had the splendid
earthenware time enough to show at the [unclear][/unclear]
[unclear]their[/unclear] Edwd had received the leases - and whether he has got them [unclear][/unclear]
by that since [unclear]mar Brny[/unclear] - Poor Thomas Harvey is in a fever and
I suppose his fate yet undecided - He was thought rather better yesterday
evening - Dear love to Debh & your good men Your affecte

My dearest Sarah
I could speak to you myself, & now as I am quite strong
enough to use Eben's speaking trumpet I pronounce
that I could [deletion]as soon[/deletion] [insertion]no more[/insertion] refuse a gift of thine, whether
valuable in amount equal to that which thou made
us in worldly eyes or only equal to an old [unclear][/unclear] of
one of the young ones than I could break the bond
of sisterly affection which will ever bind us to each other
yet so difficult is it to overcome certain feelings of
of false pride that I would have felt more happy
had the gift been smaller. My father was & is quite
delighted with it & thinks the colour & pattern uncommonly
handsome - he & I unpacked the Crate. I mean
to send thee an exact list of them which I took the evening they
arrived. there was not
one broken.
I begged the letter might wait until
Eben compares a letter to a speaking
trumpet only used on Great occasions &c &c

William is the quietest little child I ever saw
of his age - I think [deletion]s[/deletion]he is most like Mary & very
like James - Some of the workmen had been
joking with Jozy when the little fellow as
born, about his being of no consequence now -
"So" said he "I hear I am to be turned out" -
Then he was asked where he would go. - first he
spoke of Dublin - why not to Ballitore? my father
asked - oh no - he believed he would go to London
this week Thomas - This for Deborah as the
only wonderful [unclear]speech [/unclear]I can record - Ive
had a letter from Hannah & Elizabeth
yesterday - and James had one from
Margaret Grubb - she speaks of her
health as sometimes better & sometimes worse
and enjoying R. Shackletons company very much.
There seems no jealousy among the children about
the new comer - indeed whatever other faults
they have, the seem very free from that of
jealousy. I leave Lydia's messages of love &c
for James to write - as they had seen one, it is
more meet they should go thro' that channels,
My love to Edward & Eben if he be with you.
Write to us again. Let us hear something about you
we seldom do - Ever yours most affectly S.F.
What shall call our new comer? We are debating between
Wm Henry & Wm Richard we talked of Wm Ebenezer
but that is such a mouthful of a name that I think
it would best stand alone. - & Ebenezer is not among the
Fishers so they cannot take that name from our branch.
they have heaps of Williams so we must put some distinguishing
name. - I like the Richard because it combines
my only brother with my fathers name. Now
I was to have been named Wm Henry myself had
I [deletion]brought[/deletion] [insertion]been[/insertion] of another sex. We wait your decision, & you
must decide and I must have it before this week
is out if possible. He is an ugly little fellow but
large & quiet. - I am longing for thee to see them all
I was in the Kitchen today - so judge how well I am
Thomas Henry is better today - Hannah is not yet
come home & is not to hear how ill Thomas is, so
if you should see her - be guarded. Do you think
of Horace Walpole's summers Debs? This is very like
over as them. Charlotte Hanson is a nice creature &
clever withal - we get on famously without aunt
Jane & the nursetender left me in a week.
The girls mean to go to the the Sea side for a couple
of weeks & to take winter apparel

James is but so so today & could not go to the
Beach with a sore throat so we are enjoying
home but he does not like the idleness at all
So Eliza went to Bristol - & John was ill - how
are you all now? My love to the family
at Glendruid. - How are Richard & his
wife? any sign of a [unclear][/unclear]? Is Mary Doyle
taking warm baths. Are you [unclear][/unclear] at the wet
weather [unclear]in[/unclear] the way of farmers? besure to write
very very soon to us. - did you visit "the Glen
that so softly reposes Beneath the dark mountain" wh
you visited some 9 or 10 years ago. Oh ceaseless Time!
My dearest sisters farewell! I wish you were as near
to me as Castle Connell. - where Eliza Harvey is. -
her little Willie is just rescued from the jaws of death
My too careful [unclear]Dodly[/unclear] bids me stop. Ever most friendly yours
