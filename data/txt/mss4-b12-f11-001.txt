Copy of part of a letter from Eliza
Hardcastle to Dr. Fisher
My dear Dr Fisher:
I welcomed the sight of your handwriting,
but the black border of the envelope
portended that there was a tale of sorrow &
bereavement within. & I was deeply grieved
to find that it was the loss of your excellent
sister Mrs. Leadbeater you had been called
to mourn, I knew that this would indeed
occasion you the heaviest distress, &
very heartily do I sympathise in your
affliction. It is months since the
blow fell, & yet how fresh and green
the wound is, and you would not have
it otherwise, we do not wish to feel losses
of this kind less but more, nor to have
the void filled up with any earthly
good, but rather that we may enter
into a deeper fellowship with Him who

was acquainted with grief for our sakes,
[underline]who bears the heaviest end of every cross[/underline]
he lays upon us. Oh! blessed privilege
of sorrow, if [underline]He[/underline] draw near & share it with
us & [deletion]to s[/deletion] so make us more sensible of
the heights & depths of His unspeakable
tenderness and love. - The unscathed
and prosperous know little of this - it is
the [unclear]ope[/unclear] "orphans" those who have none else
to look to, to whom He says - "I will not
leave you comfortless, I will come to you" -
they hear him say "As the Father
[deletion][/deletion] hath loved me, even so
have I loved you." x x x x x
Thornville 30th of 7th mo
