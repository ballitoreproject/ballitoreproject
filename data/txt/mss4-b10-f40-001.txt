My dear Cousin
I hope thou art renovated in health
after the severe attack of illness which I
understood thou hast had some time since
& that Sally is doing well in her new undertaking,
I wish thee to tell me where & to
whom I am to hand thy small share which
is now in my hands Â£16..10s I think it is
I was lately in Ballitore & saw my aunt
she is exceedingly weak but as lively
in her intelect as she has been this long
time she desired to be dearly remember'd
to thee, she is very loving & kind, M S is
still a great sufferer I think all thy
other friends are in status quo -
I hope Mary & her family are well

thou'lt be glad to hear that our
daughter has recover'd & is now almost
as useful as ever amongst us, indeed
we try to keep C from doing too much,
Wm & Edw are laboring at their College
duties to keep up the credit of the
family in the Academic line, Edw
got a 1st honor in science on his
last examination & Wm a 2nd the
latter became nervous in the [underline]wrong[/underline]
[unclear][/unclear] became nervous in the [underline]wrong[/underline]
place he is not so stout as his
brother, however they were very well
pleased with how they fared as
there were many Competitors.
wishing thee very well my dear Cousin
& hoping to hear from thee soon I remain
thy affect. S Barrington
