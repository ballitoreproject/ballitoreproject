My Dear Lydia,
I am much obliged and gratified by thy very kind
epistle. It was more than I expected, though not more than I
desired; for I love every communication that comes from thee,
and thy communications were highly acceptable: they left a
relish on my mind which has strengthened it, and helped
to support it during some of the cloudy part of this day. My
182 children are all subjects of joy and gratitude to me; and thy
children are all subjects of joy and gratitude to me; and thy
accession to their number is a great accession to my satisfaction.
I pray thee and thy husband to be graciously preserved objects
of Divine mercy and favour - that ye may ever dwell in the
lowly valley, where the dew lies long, and there gather the fresh
manna in your own vessels, little or much, according to your measures
If it be little, if it be of the right kind it will suffice: no lack will
be experienced. They that wait on the Lord will want no good thing.
One grain of gold than a great deal of baser metal. I am sensible
