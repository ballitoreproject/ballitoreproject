As I expect I will have an opportunity to send
this I sit down to answer thy last very acceptable letter my dear
aunt thou said thou would not attribute my not writing regularly
to want of affection [insertion]and[/insertion] perhaps that made me not quite so
anxious about writing as I would have been had thou not said
that as I now am not afraid of offending thee by not writing often.
I suppose thou art now settled for the winter but
with the spring I make no doubt [deletion]but [/deletion] thou will again ramble
I wish thou would then bend thy course hither and sojourn
awhile with thy friends here I expect I will see thee at
the next quarterly meeting that will be here.
I hope thy stomach is quite well now and that
thy other [insertion]eye [/insertion]does not begin to fail does thou think [deletion]about [/deletion] the
weak one is quite irrecoverable hast thou derived any benefit
from sea-bathing? is the uneasiness which thou used to complain
of in thy side quite removed?

William Garrett told me that thou and Abby
Haughton were in Carlow I hope Abby is better is her throat
well yet? Deborah told me that she was lodging with
Betsy while Abby was from home and that she had great
pleasure with her.
By W. Garrett I received but 4 letters one from
Betsy and Margaret for which I am much obliged I was
very glad to see Betsy's writing as it was so long since she
wrote to me before I suppose her arm is quite recovered.
How [deletion]is [/deletion] [insertion]are [/insertion] Anna Taverner and Hannah Haughton
do please give my dear love to them also to my uncle aunt
and cousins my father mother brother & sisters Fanny Bewley
Abby and Becky Abby and Bessy M: and A: Doyle Jane Thomas
Molly Haughton and Joshua and Mary Webster and
any others who may enquire for me thou sees I am old
fashioned enough to send love but I hope thou will not
think it too troublesome to deliver it farewell my dear and
believe me to be thy very affectionate niece
If I can I will write to my mother
tomorrow. Do excuse this writing.
