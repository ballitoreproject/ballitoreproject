Lisburn March 8th 1810.
I am much obliged to thee my dear Friend,
for thy two very kind letters. The three pieces thou sent
for the magazine will be inserted. The dialogue was very
much admired by the Proprietors; they hope when thou
has leisure thou will write a continuation of the dialogue,
and enlarge more on the [deletion][/deletion] [insertion]injudicious extension[/insertion] of Matthew's plan &
on small farms as encreasing the comfort tho' not the
riches of a country - Who was the writer of the fate of
the nose? It amused me very highly. It completely [deletion][/deletion]
ridicules the practice which is too frequently followed of
persons applying every remedy recommended by unskillful
pretenders to medical knowledge.
I have not received any of the parcels from
Ballitore - My father has no correspondent in Dublin who
could forward them. Could you get any of your friends
in Dublin to put the gloves & books into one parcel & send
them by the [deletion]mail[/deletion] [insertion]Newry Fly[/insertion] coach directed to my father? I think it
would be much the speediest & best way of getting them
safe from Dublin - When Archer receives all the "Anecdotes"
he bespoke, I will get the money from him & the other

bookseller & remit it to thee.
I hope we shall be able to persuade my Father
to take us to Ballitore next summer. I did not mean
by what I wrote that my Father was [underline]afraid[/underline] to meet his
old friends at Ballitore, but he has heard that he was
censured by several for his conduct on the detection of
J Davis' knavery - He need not be [underline]afraid[/underline] of censure as he
is conscious he acted rightly in exposing such a man.
Indeed it is a long time since my father had reason to
think unfavorably of J D. and recent events have fully
justified his opinion - Added to all J D's knavery he
seemed to have a peculiar love for mischief-making in
families. At one time he wrote some letters to [unclear]S Linton[/unclear]
recommending him to apply for R Uprichard, at the very
sametime he & H Davis were cautioning Ruth against
marrying [unclear]S Linton[/unclear], & made Ruth promise she would
not speak of the advice they gave her to any person, &
in particular not to mention it to her aunt M. Dawson.
Nor is this the only instance I could relate of the hypocrisy
of that despicable little man. I cannot call him
by any gentler name as I have such an aversion for
hypocritical knaves - A man who openly avows his knavery
is far superior to a man who by cunning deception cheats

his neighbours.
we have heard that J Pike has
sent a paper to the monthly meeting condemning his
conduct. I think A. Knott is very much to be pitied.
I intend writing a few lines to Betsy - I wish her every
success with her benevolent plans - Thy very affectionate
S Hancock.
I am ashamed to send this wretched scrawl but I wrote in
a very great hurry - May I expect to hear from thee soon?

Mary Leadbeater
