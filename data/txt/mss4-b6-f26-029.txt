Mt.melick 15 of 11 mo - 1790.
May just inform my dear Mary that I recd.
her & her brothers letters, & was comforted thereby I think -
I had intended to have informed thee of the mistake
respecting the Monthly Meeting - Mary Pim misinformed
me - it is to be held here next 6th day - & the
day after I expect to return with thy father to Ballitore,
if he goes that day - I had concluded on proceeding
at our next Monthly meeting & felt easy at it, hope it
is so to thee, & your letters, & father's converse strengthened
me, I think, in the conclusion I had come to -
I do not go on with these friends, as I have some
little matters to settle of my own, in order to be
ready for thy father's return - Give my dear
love to thy mother, & be satisfied thou hast the sincere
affection of one who wishes thy ease & happiness
every way, & that is -
Wm Leadbeater
Be sure take care of thyself -

Mary Shackleton
Ballitore
