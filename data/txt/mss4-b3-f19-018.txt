My dear Uncle


         I read with pleasure thy kind favour, which brought the news of my two Cousins safe delivery: tis well such a skillful person as Frank Johnson was at hand at so critical a juncture: I would be pleased to hear of his getting better practice. I hope the fears of the family on account of little Abraham are entirely banished, & that he is stout & healthy. There is such a store of entertainment for the girls between Ballitore & Athy, & of employment at the Retreat, that of consequence I must not expect to hear as frequently from them as usual, especially as I cannot be so punctual as I could wish, not having it in my power often to finish a letter before it be out of date. I thank thee for putting me in the way to procure a Copy of the Verses on Springmount, which I like very well. Rachel Penrose is in want of a steady, experienced person to act as an upper-servant, or house-keeper, to whom she would endeavour to have every thing [sic] made agreeable, as to treatment salary &c: perhaps thou would be kind enough to have inquiry made, as I promised her to mention it the next time I wrote to Ballitore: My Aunt probably may know of some Friend that would answer the description, & undertake the management her [sic] household affairs. Archibald, Wife & family as well as usual; as is our little family. Tom Fayle will shortly leave us, as he has lately become concerned in one of the Sugar-houses, & is to superintend the business; besides his share of the profits I hear he is to have a house rent-free & what sugar, coal & candles he may consume.
        Pray present me very affectionately to all Friends & Relations.
                I am, dear Uncle
                        thy dutiful Nephew
                        William Rayner
