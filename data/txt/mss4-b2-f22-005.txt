Clonmel 8 month 8th 1786.

My dear Grandfather,

As I understand there is a Frank going to Ballitore I will write to thee. My aunt Molly is come here in fine Health. We all expect my Aunt Sarah here. We are in general pretty well. We have a large school. We got several Boys since vacation. My Cousin Robert Grubb gives his Love to thee. Please give my Duty and Love where proper, & believe me to be thy dutiful Grandson Abraham Grubb.

In the hurry of sending my frank last night I forgot this letter & its companion, for which omission I hope my dear Father will excuse me, & I now purpou to send them to the major. I am obliged by thy copying the letter from Edmund Burke, but grieved to see it done by thy hand. However that will still more enhance its value with the dear old woman. I long to hear how my mother is. Leadbeater told me she was fatigued with her journey to Coolegeegan, that you found her leave weak in body, but very agreeable in other aspects. I was surprised at seeing Leadbeater, who stopt the chain in which I was going to see James Keys family with aunt & Becky we persuaded him to come thither with us, which he did, & received kindness from that family, Brothers & many other friends in Clonmel. We took a memorandum of the friends names with him, where he had been. Aunt is feeble. Mr. Davis finely, I am to dine there to day. Ms. Dudley is better than this day two; she has been prevented by a severe cold from getting to Garryroam Cousin Thomas son Jo seems poorly, complains of a fullness in his stomach & head ache. I ordered him Tartar Emetick which seems to have little effect. Cousin Sally Grubb (John) has had a deal of linen, which was out drying, stolen from her the other night. I hope my dear brother will excuse my not replying to his kind letter yet & sally. My dear love to all
I am my dear father, thee M Shackleton
