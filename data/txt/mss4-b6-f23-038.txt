From crouds of sighing Suitors won
By emerald Erin's gallant son
Behold the lovely Bride appear,
Fair moving in her radiant sphere.
The gaze of wonder & delight
Fondly pursues the vision bright
[deletion]While taste & wealth conspire to grace[/deletion]
[deletion]The finished form & lovely face[/deletion]
The trifler hastens to behold
The splendid robes, the gems, the gold,
While other eyes alone admire
The [deletion]charms[/deletion] [insertion]form[/insertion] which needs not such attire.
[insertion]But he whom[/insertion] The soul which genuine feeling warms,
Contemplates more enduring charms,
Sees from these eyelids beaming bright
Angelic Pity's sacred light;
Beholds the snowy hand extend;
The Poor, the helpless to befriend

For Famine oe'r the frighted land,
Waves [deletion]with[/deletion] [insertion]wide[/insertion] the desolating [insertion]han[/insertion] wand
And Ignorance with potent spell
Untutord, Genius can repel
Can Nature's struggling efforts quell.
Yet Erin's children freely share
[deletion]With those who want the[/deletion] [insertion]The humble roof & [unclear][/unclear][/insertion] slender fare,
Yet Erin's children bear enshrin'd
In the rude breast the generous mind,
Where solid sense, & judgment clear,
And flashing wit by turns appear.
Tis theirs the tribute just to pay
Howe'er the un[deletion]couth[/deletion][insertion]taught[/insertion] the artless lay,
To Beauty, Elegance & Youth
Superior talents, worth & truth,
Tis theirs to hail with conscious pride
The happy spouse & blooming bride,
To [deletion]waft[/deletion] watch while favoring [insertion]welcome expand[/insertion] [unclear]gales[/unclear] sails
To waft the prize to Erin's land
The prize by Fortune's favours blest
The prize by Nature's favours drest,
Yet brighter than Golunda's store.
Yet richer than Peruvian ore
Yet fairer than [deletion]soft[/deletion] [insertion]sweet[/insertion] Beautys [deletion]bloom[/deletion] [insertion]eye[/insertion]
Yet [deletion]sweeter[/deletion] [insertion]softer[/insertion] than the vernal sky
To Erin's children yet more dear
To Virtues smile & Pity's tear.
