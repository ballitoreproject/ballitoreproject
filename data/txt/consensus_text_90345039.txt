the day to-gether, we
went out to Trafalgar
Terrace by the 2Â½ train
After dinner Florence
Charlie and I, took a
very pleasant walk
to (Miltown Park Avenue)
I think that was the
name, from the top
of which we had a most
beautiful view, a rich
reward for our long
walk, if reward we needed
which indeed we did
not. for the walk alone
was very pleasant.
Margt. and Aunt Elizth
went to second meeting
as we did not wish
to be out late we came
