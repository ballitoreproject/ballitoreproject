Garrett Green 4 July 1812
My dear Cousin
Since I wrote last I received a letter
from a friend of mine John Ball Printer in
Waterford by which I am rather discouraged
from attempting to look for subscriptions — he
alludes to two treatises on Book-keeping that have
been lately published & dispersed with indefatigable industry
& I recollect of a third some time before — he reasons
in this manner — if the works had merit the public
may well be supposed to have their appetite satiated
if otherwise — they might naturally be cautious, lest
another disappointment might ensue — these works
I have seen — they do not appear to me to rank
as high as some published in England, & do not
possess any originality as I recollect. The only
places in Ireland such a Book could be printed
are Dublin/'Cork from the great quantity of figures

requisite - as a successful application for subscriptions
seems so doubtful & I know of no other source for
defraying the expense I request you may apply
to your London friend; from the character he maintains
I should have no objection to throw myself on
his honour if he would undertake the publication
& in case of an encouraging sale pay me as he
might think equitable. If I could defray the
expenses of such an expedition I imagine none
would apply more industry in performing the duties
of a corrector of the press, particularly, as there should
be some management in the disposition of certain
accounts, to avoid waste of paper, I have the
fair copy about half done — if it should be advisable
to forward it to London I expect I may contrive a
conveyance from Waterford — I propose still making
gradual advances until Mr Johnson's reply reach me.
I met with a surprise this day week by Richard
taking me by the hand as I passed the Inn at Kilkenny
he told me he came with Robert Fayle who had letters
for me — I guessed the import of these letters & from

the reflection on the exhausted state of my finances I
was nearly overwhelmed. I was not aware of any
other travellers being in company & being unexpectedly
introduced to an apartment where were two
females whom I did not immediately recognise
I must have appeared to disadvantage — their stay
was so short that I had scarcely time to retrieve
The Title I proposed to prefix to my treatise. is
An Appendix to the Italian System
of Book-keeping: Displaying improvemen[unclear]ts[/unclear]
calculated to contribute to the satisfaction
of the Principals & the ease of the Book-keeper
by enabling them to exhibit a statement
of Personal Accounts at the shortest notice
By WR for many years a practical Bookkeeper in
the City of Waterford.
I should like to have it in my power to assist in arranging
for the press as there must be references from
several parts to others which can only be made with propriety
by knowing the contents of each separate page
Pray present my love to Cousin Sally & the children — to the former
I propose writing one of those days Yours sincerely Wm Rayner
