The Editor of the Reflector cannot help
telling Elizabeth Leadbeater how much he is obliged
to her for those communications which he
has received from her; he prizes them very highly
and assures her (and he hopes she will not suspect
him of a desire to flatter in saying so) that
it is not "thro' politeness alone that he has given
them a place in his collection." - he would consider
himself very ungrateful if he could even
hesitate to send the Reflectors as she desires
He would have sent them before, but the number
which she had not seen, have only just returned
from their travels.
Will you permit me now to thank you, in propria
person√¢, for your wish to see John & me in Ballitore.
It would give me great pleasure to go down, but
it is not at all likely that we can; - certainly not
both together. - we are bound to this vile place
by too many bonds. - I hope you will receive

the inclosed paper safely; I ought to beg pardon
for keeping it so long. Your directions, with regard
to [insertion]it[/insertion] have been religiously observed. The sentiments
appear to me out of the common line; the conclusion
is particularly striking. With respect to his 
observations on music, I cannot think the author
was acquainted with our native melodies, when he
says "the artificial combination called an air will
not explain what I mean." - there are a few of
them which can, I think, "express the state of the soul
& reveal all its emotions." I may observe what the
author does not mention, that music whilst it reveals
the feelings of the person who thus expresses himself,
calls up at the same time similar feelings
in his auditors. But the language of beauty
forbear.-
Will you excuse for what he has
written yours sincerely
Richd. Barrington
May I trouble you to send the book and note accompanying
this to E. Gough. Haves you can seen [unclear]Armata[/unclear]?
if you have not get it from her before she returns
it.
