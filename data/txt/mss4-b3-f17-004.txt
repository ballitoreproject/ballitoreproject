My dear Cousin,


        The revival of our correspondence gives me a gleam of pleasure of the most pleasing description, I repeatedly felt and regreted [sic] my loss by the suspension, but, encumbered as thou art with various concerns, i confess myself so convinced of the propriety of self-denial, that I suffered in silence least [sic] thy kind disposition towards me should at any time incline thee to inconvenient exertion.
        Thou wilt doubtless be deeply concerned with us for the grievous mementos given of the uncertainty of all earthly possessions, the failure of Robert Wright and Son, has brought adverse fortune on many who lived in all the ease of secure competence of these John Lindo [?] and Nathaniel Springall are painful instances, they have been obliged to submit to a temporary cessation from business; however I trust their characters will remain unblemished
        I scarcely know what to say in return for thy affectionate and salutary counsel, I feel the necessity of adopting it, and I am grateful for the communication, in order to discharge the task I have engaged in, I find that I want knowledge and improvement in various respects; it is an awful thing to train the first intellectual shoots, the apprehension of giving them a wrong inclination strikes me with a degree of horrorI do not think my little Ward will ever possess a brilliant understanding, but she has all those winning graces which Poets ascribe to a favourite fair, she ^has^ moreover a superabundance of affection in her composition, that soon steals ones [sic] heart, and would almost disarm one of the resolution necessary to fix her attention
        My dear Debbys letter speaks her happy which thou mayst be sure is cause of rejoicing to me; I fear I shall not be able to write her by this packet, if not, be pleased to assure her of the continuance of my regard; indeed I wish thy whole family to be sensible of the love I bear them, particularly thy good Wife to whom thou wilt make my respects
        Farewell my dear Cousin! beleive [sic] me with sincere friendshipThy ObligedHannah Pim
