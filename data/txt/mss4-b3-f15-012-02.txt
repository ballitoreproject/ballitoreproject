Ballitore: 12/9 month 1782

My dear friend,
	Thy uncle & aunt Pike were at Edenderry [at the Quarterly meeting] about 26 of us lodged at Joseph Inmans. He & Ruth are a most pleasing couple. It is people of their cast & kind which I think are most happy: they enjoy the comforts of this life with a pure relish, for they enjoy them with moderation & thankfulness, and their spirits are in a state of preparation for the enjoyment of those unmixed pleasure [sic] which succeed in a glorious life to come. ++++
	Thy several communications, my dear friend, though not re-echoed in this, were, be assured, very acceptable to me. I am at present able to make but a very poor return - however friendship & good desires, when in the power of my hand to prefer them, are unalterably with me on thy behalf. Farewell, my beloved friend, & may that help, that consolation, & all that wisdom which is solid, substantial & sure, be ever near to support thee, says
	thy faithful friend
		Richard Shackleton
