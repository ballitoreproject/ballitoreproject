people - We spent rather a pleasant evening.
Grandmama's 85th.. birthday - Polly
and Thomas spent it at Muckamore -
Avy all alone at Orange Hill as he did
not accept the invitation he got there.
Margt. gradually getting better - but
still confined very much to her room
30th.. Thursday I took a delightful ride -
the air was so balmy - the sunshine so
bright and Fan in such spirits I greatly
enjoyed it - Margt went out to dine
accompanied by Lyd - She is [underline]gradually[/underline]
getting a little better -
31st.. The last day of the old year - -
Another year gone by - oh how time flies,
and is there [underline]any[/underline] improvement - yes as
far as regards myself I think there is
a [underline]little[/underline] just a little - in [underline]one[/underline] respect at
least - I do not think I am [underline]less[/underline] contented
at all events than I was this time last year
I [underline]hope[/underline] more so - Not that I have got
the wished for [underline]something[/underline] - but the [underline]longing[/underline]
for it is decidedly less ardent - as for
improvement in other things alas I fear
it is but little - Oh that we all may
spend the coming year better than the last
December 1.8.5.8.
I had a letter from Polly
to day - a nice one -
another from Bessie.
Goodbye 1858 -
