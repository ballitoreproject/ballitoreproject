23rd. At Lisburn - James Strangman
met me at the train. On entering
the drawing room where Jas brought
me on my arrival, I was rather surprised
to see, Mary Richardson, for I
thought she would have been too ill
to be down. She appeared greatly altered
since the last time I saw her, and
I think scarcely knew who I was.
Johnathan and Eliza Richardson were
spending the evening there, also an old
schoolfellow of Philip's Robert Grubb.
