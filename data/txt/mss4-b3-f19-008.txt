My dear Uncle,


        Thou wilt, I hope, do me the justice to believe it was not a want of a due sense of thy kindness in favouring me with thy Correspondence that prevented me so long from addressing thee: but I wished to pay the tribute of Duty & Affection to as many as I could whenever I sent a Cover to the house which made me delay until time would permit [sic] to write more letters than one. I intend to be careful in future to escape being thought remiss. I wrote by Fourth-nights post to Molly which I imagined might arrive before you set off for Dublin. I request thee to present my acknowledgments to Cousin Sally Birkbeck for her kind endeavours to procure me a place but as by thy intercession I am agreeably settled I shall not at present have any farther occasion of her obliging exertions. I know not where I could be placed to more advantage than here, after leaving affectionate relations & what is moregood Friends. I esteem it a very great favour to be under the fostering care of Archibald Balfour Pray present me respectfully & affectionately to himMy Landlady has been very ill yesterday: better to-day but not fit to get up. She had an Hysterical fit Poor Pat thought he was about to lose her she was so extremely ill. Two nights ago landed in the County Wexford & last night arrived here Peter Cambridge: I just had a word or two with him en passant in the Meeting-house yard. I understand he designs shortly for Cork. Betty Gregory continues tolerably well she expects to go on shipboard about one oclock to-morrow to sail for Mile-head. I hope my Aunt is in the enjoyment of health & good spirits. My dear love to her & all the family that went along with thee. Elizabeth Balfour & her daughter desire their love to be presented to you.
        I am, dear Uncle
                thy dutiful affectionate Nephew
