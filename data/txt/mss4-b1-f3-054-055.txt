					Ballitore, 28th of Thirdmonth 1777.
	My Dear Margaret,
		Though I have not written immediately to thee for a long time past, as the intelligence communicated to they dear sister Deborah seems to answer the end of writing to you both; yet I believe thou art thoroughly persuaded of the warmth of my affection for thee, and the solicitude with which I wait thy approaching trial.
	Thou art among most cordial and affectionate relations, and hast all the means of help at hand, which prudence may think necessary, or competence can procure. Cheer up, then, my dear child,  trust in Almighty help, be not too anxious about contingent circumstances, nor look too far before thee: live a day, an hour, a minute at a time, as well as thou canst, and leave the future. Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof. We are creatures but of a moment, so that in husbanding and improving the smallest portions of our time, consists our greatest wisdom. I embrace thee with sincere affection. ***Thy tenderly affectionate father
											R. S.
