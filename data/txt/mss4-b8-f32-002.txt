My Dearest William

bring you to town while I am there as that itself would give me
pleasure to see you there as you will not com heir indeed William
I am afraid you are not so fond of your Poor Sister as I hoped
you wair but maby I expect too much for I will not sit ill
Nature to your a count becaus in many diferent ways you
have syrved me with real affection but you will know when

disapointed at your not sending for my till tub of butter

to me but it canot be helped now.

Mr Harper bids me tell you he has a very tight Meare
