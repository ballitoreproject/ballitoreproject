vexation a pleasure-tourist sometimes undergoes - Tell Sarah I received
a small parcel by Joss Hill for Lydia & which I have in safe
keeping - and that we are obliged to her & you for all the trouble
our commissions or rather Lyd's have given you - I intend to go
to Clonmel on Friday & return with Lyd on monday - She is
at cousin Aby's & is delighted with his company & also with that
of aunt Grubb who though very delicate is very pleasant - We have
been daily expecting a full account of dear Deb's health from
Betsy and have been daily disappointed. We had a letter from
Eben written the day after their arrival at Cheltenham to
which Betsy added a few lines saying she would write soon-
and that soon has not come yet - Eben writes to me chiefly
on the Poor Laws - he has already furnished me with a good
essay - and you well know the caustic humour & keen good
sense with which he talks and writes - I ought, my dear
Edward to have written to you before to render perfect
the chain which binds the three sisters & their three [underline]spose[/underline]'
together - How delightful it is to think of dear Deb's recovery
& in such a pleasant unexpected way too - I expect our
little English niece is coming on as well as her [underline]astonished[/underline] parents
could expect - We have my brother Thomas here still
- I do not know what he can do - for he will not be a physician -
and as for his other design teaching - I fear he can
not be a schoolmaster - and yet I think that nothing but

an actual failure in the one will drive him to the other.
It is pleasant that brother Dick has fixed himself at last
I have not heard how he likes his mills - but I know that
when I visited them with Eben last summer they were
in sad condition - You must give my love to dear sister
Sarah & to your sister Eliza & to my darling little
Maggie, of whom it is pleasant to hear now & then from
her mama & my best respects to your father & mother
& my remembrance to the boys - Indeed I have reason
to think of you all with affection for your kindness -
your great kindness always to Lyd & me - I hope we may
often have the opportunity of reciprocating it - When shall
we see any of you in Limerick? - Little I thought at
the time I passed you by without recognizing you in
the street here that we should at this day be brothers -
Time reconciles much stranger things & I thank him
that he has conferred such a benefit on me -
Yours most affectionately
JJFisher
