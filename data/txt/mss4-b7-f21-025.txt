19 St. James's Sqre. Bath
Nov: 7 - 1805
Your letter my dear Friend, was sent from
Coniston hither - I thank you for the kindness with
which you ever write, tho' I sincerely regret the principal
subject - yet, why regret? rather let me say "may
my letter end be like hers! You will excuse my brevity
to day, when I tell you that my dear Lady is now
lying on a Bed beside me, attended twice a day by the
Medical tribe - & God only knows what the event may
be; I write on my knee, in almost utter darkness.
My beloved Bess too, is in a very bad state of health,
the consequence of a neglected Cold, & when I brought her
here, I apprehended a confirm'd decline. - Her Physician
assures me her Lungs are safe, & this is my best comfort at
present. May God bless you! be assured I partake tenderly
in your Joys, & sorrows - for I am very Sincerely Yrs.
The Bells are ringing, for 19 Sail of the Line being
Captured by Ld. Nelson - who only lived to see the Victory
