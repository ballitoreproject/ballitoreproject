[unclear]Muncaster[/unclear] Castle Dec. 23 - 8
1808
I know not my dear friend, which of us
has to answer for the very long silence that has [deletion][/deletion] [insertion]take place[/insertion] between
us,– but being now on a visit to Lord Muncaster who will [unclear]frank[/unclear]
my letter - & having heard from our good Thos. Wilkinson that you
have been ill,- I am resolved to enquire after you. Now, pray
take into consideration, that I am really very sincerely intereste[unclear]d[/unclear]
in your welfare, & therefore anxiously wish for your answer to my
enquiry - At length, both Mrs. Bowdler & I have got your poems,
[unclear]but[unclear] it was only two days before I left home,- however I devoted
[unclear][/unclear] the Evenings to your Book, & was much pleased with it -
to me, it had peculiar charms from my knowledge of the place[unclear]s[/unclear]
& of many of the Persons - & especially from my high [unclear]esteem[unclear]
the amiable Author - the paper & type are both good, so that it
is in every respect, an excellent publication [insertion][unclear][/unclear][/insertion] at a very cheap
price - it will give me very great satisfaction to hear the Sale
is equal to the merit of the Work.- Thos. Wilkinson tells [unclear]me[/unclear]
you had met with my little simple "Grandchild" as you [unclear]call it[/unclear]
& that you had approved of the part you had read,- I shall[unclear] like[/unclear]
to have your opinion of the whole - I had prepared you for the partiality
of the Editor as far as related to myself,- but in my conscience!
I very much like
your former Neighbor
Mrs. Keatinge – She has
a great deal of quiet
humour, good sense
humour, good Sense
& a good heart, I pity
& a good heart,- I pity
her extremely too.
I will tell you all
about Tent Lodge
anr. time, but I
wish you wd. come
& see it - The
Weather is so intensely
cold, that
I have literally written
on my Knees -
If you damp the
Print on the back
& iron it, the creases
will come out.

I beleive there is not a word said of my Angel Daughter, which
she did not justly deserve - I shall begin to give the world in general
more credit than I used to do, for a love of Truth, & simplicity, - for [unclear]really[unclear]
my "Grandchild" had no other recommendation, & yet it is astonishing
how indulgent the Public have been to the Work - We are now printing
the 6th Edition - & as no Engraving will be affix'd till the 7th Edn. (which
will be in 2 Vol'., one of them "Memoirs of Frederick & Margaret Klopshoed"
[unclear]translated[/unclear] from the German by the author of fragments [unclear][/unclear] I shall
run the risque of [deletion]one[/deletion] [insertion]a print[/insertion] being spoil'd by enclosing it in this letter -
I wish you were with [deletion]one[deletion] in this Castle, it would excite your Poetic Genius -
here in a Tower built by Agricola, Lord M. would show you a
most curious Glass bason call'd "The Luck of Muncaster" - in the year
1461 Henry took refuge in this Castle during the time of [insertion]his[/insertion] distress - & on his
departure being unable to reward the family as he thought they deserve[unclear]d[unclear]
he presented to them (what in [underline] his [underline]his[/underline] opinion was the most precious [unclear][/unclear]
he possessed) the Glass which contain'd the Holy Water he was in [unclear][/unclear]
of using,—at the same time fervently praying, that "whilst they [unclear][/unclear]
that Glass, good Luck might befall the House of Muncaster," - It is
a proud Relique of ancient Loyalty, & Kingly Gratitude! ! This, is a
very fine House & place, but the Inmates are my delight, - they consist
of Ld. M. (a widower) & 2 very amiable Daughters, well inform'd
unaffected, senseble young women, - their Ld., has great talents, [unclear][/unclear]
information, [insertion]is[/insertion] perfectly well-bred, [insertion]with[/insertion] great vivacity, & true Christian [unclear]Piety[/unclear]
his Religious & political opinions quite after my own heart; therefore you
[unclear] may [/unclear] judge, how very agreeable my visit is to me—I forget that I must not
[unclear] scribble [/unclear] on the other half sheet, for it wd. prevent my enclos. S the Print,—so
I will only beg you to write soon, & to remember me very kindly to all
Those who do me the favor to remember [unclear] BY. [/unclear] very Sincerely JM
I expect to find J. Willkinson on my return home, __The Major is with his Regiment
I expect to find T. Willkinson on my return home, - The Major is with his Regimt. -
