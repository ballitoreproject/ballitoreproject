My dear Miss Barrington
I could not forget my interview
 with you nor the many useful and
pleasant thoughts which resulted to
me from that accidental meeting in
the Railway Carriage - much however
of sorrow & of lasting privation
intervened to prevent my continuing
our intercourse, for many a long
abroad edged envelope was pinned
to the Cloth of my Writing table to
receive my intended letters, which I
had not energy to write & which still
 reproached me by their empty [unclear][/unclear]

cover - it is not many weeks since
I threw it into the Fire - The
years since we met lie heavy
on me and I have difficulty often
in getting thro' what I have to do - however
one must struggle as cheerfully as
one can knowing that the [unclear]learning[/unclear] &
its rest must come to us all -
There are many in Paris known to
me who had nothing to say to the
War making for whom I have great
compassion - & a friend at hand
is interested in making a little
fund to be ready for food when
Paris & the very little I can give
is bound there, but I laid [underline]your[/underline]
case before a neighbour who is
rich & who prefers the peasantry
to the Soldiery & who has promised
me a donation for your fund
which I hope will come before I
have to close this - whatever it may
be I am glad to have got it for
you - - My own sympathies are
strongly with the poor industrious
people in London & on the Southern
coasts of England who are
overwhelmed by the accession of
Foreigners who having brought everything
they could with them are
pushing our own people out
of work and bread & in London
adding to the horror of the
Small Pox Epidemic by the
crowding of Hotels & Rooms -
There is a limit to every ones
power of giving & without in
the least quoting that "Charity begins
at

 at home" in my narrow or selfish
spirit I must say that those who
have not much to give must make
a choice & I go with the Home Sufferers
from the War - but I will whenever
opportunity allows mention "The Victims"
for whom you plead
I wonder what your Brother now
thinks of the House legislation
question - is it nearer than when
we spoke of it?
Believe me My dear Miss Barrington
with much esteem
Yours very truly
E M Caulfield
