Lindley Murrays' Holsgate near York 8mo 15 1786
I believe my dear Molly must call this a [underline]billet[/underline] for the limited
time will hardly allow of writing a letter, however, I shall go on, till it is calld for - In the first
place must tell thee I knew nothing of Rbt. Grubbs intending to go to Ireland so soon, till
he had almost reachd that place, or should certainly have endeavoured to let thee know
by him how very acceptable thy kind remembrance was to me - as also was thy
dear worthy Mothers letter - The particular mention of persons, some of whom I had
great reason to esteem, recalls passd scenes, with a mixture of pleasure & pain
Tell the dear good creature her affectionate express[insertion]ns[/insertion] of regard drew tears of gratitude
from my eyes - both Her's & thine deserve abetter return than I can possibly
now make, so I must beg you will give me credit yet a little longer - I understand
a Son of Wm. Tukes is to set off in the morng. towards Whitehaven & supposing it to be
an easy conveyance [insertion]am[/insertion] induced [deletion]now[/deletion] to write thus hastily - Thou hast heard long
before this that I was not at the late Solemnity in London - my health was then such
as would not bear the fatigue of the journey - Had my dear Ballitore friends (of the
[unclear]Richards[/unclear] [insertion]especially[/insertion]) been there, I should greatly have regretted not being on of the number
Thy pleasant mention of [unclear]represtatives[/unclear] made me smile - I think thou stands a good
chance of being a chosen [underline]one[/underline] in time - suppose thou should come over as one next
year - but this is supposing your worthy elders would decline coming themselves
& I dont like to give up the hope of once more meeting them in mutablity - Thy
valuable packet was safely handed me - & thou hast made me thy debtor indeed
I find the J-- far more interesting than I had an idea of - places [unclear]???[/unclear] are so lively
deserv'd, that my curiosity seems satisfied - nor do I even wish to be in Westminster. As
always my Molly was with me to point out [insertion]what[/insertion] was worth viewing - had thou
gone to London, believe thou would have found an agreable friend in Peggy Wilson of
Kendall - & expecting I should not be there myself to meet thee endeavourd to engage
her as thy friend - Ive seen (tho not with her consent) some well wrote lines on the
death of a relation - not long since she took great delight in drawing Landscapes
& as at which she was a proficient, but threw the pencil by on accot of a religious
scruple - I understand she had burnt several pieces of her poetry - If they were all
like what I saw - it was a pitty - I by no means approve of a persons letting every
little [unclear]pices[/unclear], (the mere sport of the pen) get air - but where they have a moral tendency
& are not likely to bring unkind reflections on the authors - why should they be destroyed
How kind [insertion]in[/insertion] thee to take so much pains to gratify me - The nice letter case is much
admird. I prize it more for being wove by [insertion]thy[/insertion]self - tho it must have been difficult to do
without a frame - as to the pritty bit of [unclear]span[/unclear] I left it on thy book closed on purpose, thinking
it a pitty to derive thee of it for it's handy to keep down the paper - I was much
disappointed that thy dear Bm. Abram did not return home this way - His friendly
letter & thy worsted were handed me timely - Please to rememver me affectionately to him
his dear Lydia, Polly Miller, poor dear Anna Taverner - Hannah Haughton & her sisters, & a
double portion of very dear love to thy worthy parents - also my kind remembrances to M.
Hudson - & be sure not to forget good old Nanny in this distribution of love - tell her I am
glad she is spared to her friends a little longer - when my cough was at the worst last winter
she was often brought to my mind - the kind friends I was with had it not in their power
to supply me with Butter mild, as she us'd to do - I generally drink it 2 or 3 times a week now.
Thou asks me if I have seen the Cumberland P--- I have - it was at Kendall - & pleasantly
told him I shd be glad to rummage his desk - & he has favourd me with a few pieces in prose
& verse - If we meet again, may shew them to thee - I think him a sensible diffident man
indeed - I believe he has an honest heart -
I find my paper is not call'd for yet, so
please to inform RG of the following -
may
Sarah Priestman's love to Robt. Grubb, &
desires he will buy "Two Pounds of the leaden
[unclear]plaister[/unclear], "It is sold by Thomas Bewley of Dublin.
It may be either sent by some person coming, or kept till
he returns himself - & get the directions for using, with
a [unclear][/unclear] of its virtues

give thee some little accot. of my poor Pilgrim, who is favourd to rub along with out
much complaing - His last came to hand this afternoon dated Swaffham the 11th instant
He had just finished visiting families at Norwich in company with Martha Routh & Rebecca
Wright — He expected to go southward. His sight of future service was short, as usual
I know not when I shall see him, but should he point out any place for me to go to, when
I should be likely to see him oftener, I would willingly [insertion]leave[/insertion] my present every way, agreeable asylum
I have been with my country folks, Lindley & Hannah Murray abt. 4 months
The situation is healthful & pleasant - & my health is finely restor'd - L.M. has been deprived
nearly - of the use of his limbs these 3 years, the weakness came on after a fit of the
influensey — he sometimes rides a few miles 2 [insertion]cets[/insertion] a bay. & his wife & I take turns in the carriage
which has been of great advantage to me. Rebecca Jones & Sally Grubb were well at
Penryn near Falmouth the 4th inst. going [deletion]towards[/deletion] [insertion]for[/insertion] the meetg. towards the Lands end & so up to
Gloucester - a Circular meetg. is held there in 9 mo - Wm. Mathews was lately waiting a fair
wind at Bristol, where had taken passage in an American ship — I can't justly tell how
or where our other Americans are dispos'd of — but dont hear that the others are likely
to embark very soon — one of my American sisters husband & son arrivd out Bristol
& met dear Wm. Mathews on Bristol Wharf — how joyful the unexpected meeting must
have been! — I've not yet seen this valued brother but daily expect him — I had pleasing
accts. from my beloved family at home - I know thy tender mind will rejoice at this news -
John Pemberton wrote Wm. Tuke dated 4mo. 2nd & [unclear]4u[/unclear] Newark on Sanda one of the Northern Isles
of Orkeny — they had several meetgs. in different parts of the Island & sometimes in their worship houses
were recd. & entertained both by ministers & others with great kindness - many meetings from 150
to 300 people, who behav'd with sobriety - & some tendered by the gospel message & power - He could
[underline]not endure as[/underline] last year — & excepting a little cough & pain of his breast [deletion][/deletion] — was pretty well —
- I had the inclosd by me, perhaps it may not be unacceptable to thy father - I am thy affectnt obligd frd
Worthy E Tuke & family as well. I am delighted with the management of her lovely little scholars) S.G.D.
they often come here — Elin Abrams is a sweet amiable young woman — but I suppose thou knows her
when thou hast oppoy. please to give my love to Dr. Jos. & E. Pike, also to my valued friends Jos. & Jane Williams if I
had time wd. gladly send him a line by this oppo - thy dear sister Sally & our Betsy Pim are not forgot by me — some
future day I may, I may tell them so —
