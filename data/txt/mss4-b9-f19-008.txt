to JS's account) greatly improved both
in learning & in his disposition for
learning Anne Shannon came here yesterday

dear love to her, I hope thou wilt see
all (or at least) most part of the beauties
of Munster I suppose George is at

to thee to have [underline]one[/underline] of thy Ballitore friends
with thee but how much more so it
must be to have [underline]three[/underline] - Sarah Tooli

to live together Margaret Williams is very
bad in one of her [underline]nervous[/underline] complaints

wedding ? I hope thou wilt go to the
Lake of Killarny before thou comes
home & then all thou would want
Art thou to be at Roberts
