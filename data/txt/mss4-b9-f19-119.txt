My dear E - Jas Graydon call'd
here this evening to enquire after his
book again, he desires me to remember
him to thee & say that
he is extremely sorry to ask
for the book but its owner is
impatient for it - Willy has got
4 [unclear][/unclear] & I hope will get some
rest now, Elica writes me word [unclear][/unclear]
he can say dad quite plain [unclear][/unclear]
much for him the others are [unclear][/unclear]
well - I hope my father is nothing
the worse for coming to Dublin
& that he follows the Doctor's advice
& rides on horse back, my dear
love is to him, I was disappointed
about D's bonnet Murrow had
been to look for it but found that
it was not dy'd deep enough or
denied the dyer to give it another
dip - I hope to have it soon & send it
