Carlow 9th [unclear]June[/unclear] 1819
Dear Mary
I recd thy note to Fanny Bewley
relative to the balance due M: StGeorge I
wrote to Jno. Hancock abt it soon after thy
first application & rec'd for answer that he
had not recd. the acct. from the Agent of
the Magazine when he did that he wd. direct
me to pay it - however as I believe
thy [unclear]acct[/unclear] to be correct - I have sent thee
157 by Fanny
I recd the volume of [unclear]Belstones[/unclear] history
wch. required no appology from
thy generous [unclear]hand [/unclear] - wch. is always hasty
to lend & seldom to borrow
Our Thos has been confined to bed a day
or two wth a feverish complaint - we called
in our Maharg to see him today - he
hopes it may be removed by a little
timely care - thine affy Sam Haughton
