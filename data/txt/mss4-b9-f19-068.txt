Britain street 12 th of 2 nd mo 1824
My dear Elizth
I am uneasy lest you should not have rec.d
the hamper which contained the 1st half notes & some
change the balance of our account with various other
things, it was left at Mulhall's Garden Lane for Connor
I intended to have sent this letter by E Chandlee but
D Johnson disappointed me - I wrote in such a
hurry by Connor that I hardly took time to tell my
father how much obliged we were for the turkies
which he was so kind to send & which were a great
treat I am also much obliged for the eggs and catsup.
As to thy to Edw, Sam Fazle one of my aunt's sons
is at present looking for a place & has given in
his name to the Patriotic Insurance Company to try
to get a elcakspip in it he will not know whether
he succeeds or not till thee end of a month & I think
should he nnot, he would answer Rich'd very
well but many things might make it better for him
to be in Dublin but he would rather be employ'd
any where than be idle & I think it would be well
y thou'd find out Rich.d's; terms & send one word
what they are & whether Sam would have first deys

to go to meeting & so forth, he is very good humour'd
& active & industrious & I think Richd would be very
well off to have him, he is at present employ'd here
& some time ago I thought of writing to Richd about
him & then again I thought that perhaps Richd could
not afford to employ him so said nothing about it
We heard also from England I suppose about the same
time that you did & much the same news, with dear
love to all I conclude thy affect SB
has my mother set out yet ? I wish she would
go by way of Dublin & rest herself here
