Thursday - Beautiful weather
indeed this is and I hope
may continue so -
I took a fine long pleasant
ride with Patrick this morning
on the renowned Oaklands
who certainly [underline]does[/underline] merit the
praise of his Mistress -
I wont flatter him by calling
him handsome but no fault
shall I find with his elastic
gait fine trot, or easy canter
He leaps well also as experience
can testify - Isabel was
so much afraid of my being disappointed
of this neighbourhood (compared
to Fassaroe) that she quite under
rated its attractions and I was
agreeably surprised to find it
so pretty - The weather and
season are certainly greatly in
its favour and I only hope
it may continue &c -
it may continue so -
As we returned through Ballytore
and Oaklands' shoe was loose
with the tame scenery
