Ah my beloved sister Peggy, who art dearer
to me than ever thou wert, I would have written
to thee before if I thought I could, - but the
thought of writing seemed, & seems, so hard to
me that I shrink from it. Many are the
kind letters I have received, not one of which
can I, with any comfort, set about replying
to, - they are expressive of thankfulness to Him
whose right it is to give & take away, - they
breathe the language of sweet resignation to
His divine will: - Oh if I could feel this
way, sure I would be thankful too: - but
alas! I fear I do not: - what little Good I
have hitherto felt, seems as tho' it was
lost [insertion]to me[/insertion] with my endeared father: - this grieves
me to the heart, because I know it is
wrong, nor would it meet [underline]his[/underline] approbation
were such little things [underline]now[/underline] to employ
his attention. When I seek retirement
(which [underline]he[/underline] loved) I can but weep & lament
my loss: - sure this must be displeasing
in the sight of perfect Goodness.
Indeed, my dear sister, I mourn over
myself, because I do feel as a cast-a-way,
& I pity you, because it will add to your
sorrow

sorrow. When & while our ever loved parent
was ill, his expressions of affection to me were
hard to bear, - I thought if he had been fretful,
as some are, I could have spoken more
to him, & done more for him, - but it was
so entirely the contrary that I could [underline]not[/underline]
speak, but had often to leave his room. -
As to giving him up, - I could not, - but very
foolishly entreated his life, Oh how I covanted,
that I would count nothing [underline]hard[/underline] that
was required of me, if [underline]he[/underline] was but spared
a little longer, even till I had got a little
strength: â€“ it grieves me to have it to
tell thee, that I felt [insertion](feel)[/insertion] as tho' Good was
taken from me. Yet sure [underline]I believe[/underline] the
Everlasting Father remains, who will
hear, if properly cried unto, - but I
have neither Faith nor courage (who
have so erred,) so to do. Thus I am, -
but I believe I am still doing wrong
in causing [underline]thee[/underline] trouble. - Be not troubled
my beloved Peggy, who knows but
[insertion]for[/insertion] [underline]your sakes[/underline] I may be removed eer
I bring dishonour on the Cause you
have

have, & are vindicating. My mother is
very feeble, & easily fluttered in her spirits:
We got her to our last Mo: meeting, & to
spend a few days in Carlow: - & I hope she
will get to the Q.ly meeting at Edenderry
next week: - the being amongst her friends
revives her I think. I believe my father
thought well of Abram's concludion about
his school, expressed so to a friend: he
thought so well of his children that he
was apt to approve of what they did.
My mother's dear love to thee: she
took kind thy letter, - she loves thee
dearly, - we all love thee, - for [underline]I[/underline]
can love a little [underline]still[/underline]. Dear Nancy Grubb
can tell thee how we go on, she has paid
us a sweet substantial visit, like herself.
[underline]Farewell[/underline] my dearly beloved sister.
The Retreat: 20/9 mo: 1792.
Regulating some papers the other day
of my mother's, I found the inclosed,
she knows not how she came by it.
