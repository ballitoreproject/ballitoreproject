Lisburn 8 mo 23rd 1813
My dear friend
I must appear very negligent in
not acknowledging the receipt of thy letter sooner,
but a brief statement of facts must be my
apology. I did not receive thy letter for two weeks
after it was written; then I could not procure
the remnants for some time, & after I did procure
them, my time & attention were so fully occupied
with various things, particularly in the
highly honorable employment of copying petitions
to parliament, entreating that Orange societies
& processions may be repressed, that I
had little leisure for writing letters. I was not
however unmindful of thy letter, & on Fifthday
last, I sent 44 yards of linen & 28 of diaper remnants
to Dublin, directed as thou desired. I could
not procure any lawn remnants. I got from the
Richardsons 28 yards of linen remnants at 20d
£ s d
2.6.8
28 yards of diaper at 10d
1.3.4
1.6.8
From my Father 16 yards of linen at 20d
£4.16.8
The amount of the remnants bought from the Richardsons,
£3.10, I will thank thee to send [insertion]to me[/insertion] by
the first opportunity, as they have no correspondent

in Dublin whom [insertion]they[/insertion] would wish to receive the amount,
the £ 1.6.8 due my Father may be placed to
his account with Betsy Shackleton & thee. At
different times he paid Abraham & Betsy for
50 Cottage Stories & 25 Dialogues, amounting to £3.17s.1d.
out of which he received for books sold - 3:11:2
Archer, a Belfast bookseller, owes for 32 copies of
Cottage Stories, & 26 Dialogues, 6 copies of each
were [insertion]also[/insertion] sent to Ballymena, so when these are
paid, a balance will be due to you; the copies
which yet remain will I think be sold. I do
not know whether thou understands my statement
of this account, as I am conscious that I
have not been very clear & perspicuous.
Have Betsy Shackleton's other Stories been sent
to press yet? I am sorry to find by Mary
Shackleton's letter to Betsy that Deborah is not
stout.
The Belfast Magazine now goes to England
free of postage; owing to some dispute
between E.S. Lees, & Freeling of London, the Magazines
were charged postage either once or twice
but I hope it will not again occur.
We have heard that S. Shackleton
intends visiting the North soon; please tell
her that my Father joins me in requesting
that she may pay us a visit. My Father

is very far from being stout, but his mind is
incessantly active, & he seems never to think
of himself, so much is his mind occupied
about others; he is uncommonly active in promoting
the petitions against the Orangemen.
The rest of the family are well; as to myself
I never enjoyed better health than I do at present.
I take a great deal of exercise in the open
air, & I hope to lay in a large stock of health
before next Winter.
As for the persons for whom thou inquires,
I can say little about some of them. I have not
heard any thing lately of Anne Grant. The
last account of Trotter was, that he was [unclear][/unclear]
[unclear][/unclear] for debt; his character has sunk
in the estimation of those who formerly [unclear][/unclear] had
a favourable opinion of him, & I believe he never
deserved the good opinion of the respectable
men with whom he wished to be intimate.
Miss Balfour has a boarding school in Belfast;
but as literature is unfashionable with
almost all classes of people in Belfast, Miss
Balfour has not written any [deletion][/deletion] thing for
the public for some time past. Betsy Johnston
is very well; she is a very valuable & very
affectionate friend to me. I have not heard very

lately from T. Houlbrooke - Rushton spoke of
retiring from business; his wife & second daughter
are dead, his eldest daughter married, his
son apprentice in London, & he has only one
daughter to take care of him. His business was
not very profitable, & probably feeling that
the world has not been his friend, he wished to
retire to a cottage in the country, but I believe
he has not put his desires into execution. He need
not hope for happiness in a cottage, unless he has
other sources of happiness & comfort than the mere
cottage, but sometimes even a strong mind conceives
romantic ideas. With love to all who think me worth inquiring
about, I am sincerely thy affectionate S Hancock
Has Wm. Lefanu published the Magazine
which he [unclear]intended[/unclear], & what is
its title?
