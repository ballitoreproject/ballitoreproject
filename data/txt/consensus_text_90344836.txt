ordered at two but we did not
sit down to it, till near five
as the boys did not return till then
Poor fellows they were dreadfully
tired, as the ascent up the
mountain was very difficult,
and the day very warm -
Margt and I when waiting
took a stroll up the road to see
if we could see any sign of
them but without success, however
we had for our trouble a fine
view of the bay from a little
hill which we climed -
After dinner the boys altho'
so tired, borrowed a boat and
rowed us all about this part
of the bay - Winding their
way through the little islands
which are very [unclear]numerous[/unclear] -
we saw a great number of
cranes - flying and [unclear] [unclear]perching[/unclear]
