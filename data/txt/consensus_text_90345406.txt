Papa to town again. Charlie and
x 28th..
Avy to school. Joe and I took a
Avy to shoot. Joe and I took a
[extra line]
ride round by Tinnahinch. ch. The roads
were very slippery in some places, but
we did not break either our own heads
or the horses knees. I had a very
pleasant letter from Liddy to day. She
wrote from Islington B' Cadbury's and
said she was enjoying herself very
much, they were [underline]so[/underline] kind. This was
Polly's wedding day and Anna's birthday.
x 29th.. Uncle Thomas, Aunt Eliza, and Uncle Arthur
dined here, also Mr Cuff who surprised
us, as it was 2nd.. day he was invited
for, but that being a holy day, he did
not want to come I suppose.
Avy and I had a fine ride down to
Bray to day; before they came.
x 30th.. Seventh day. I wonder what is coming
over Polly that she does not write.
Now she owes me ever so many letters,
but I suppose she has plenty to do.
Joe and I took another ride to day -
