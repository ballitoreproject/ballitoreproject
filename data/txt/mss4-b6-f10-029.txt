" I do not understand Mary Leadbeaters acct. as
not knowing what money she paid Lees-
her acct stands thus in the Magazine books
4 yrs. from 1811 to 1814 for herself - Â£4-0-0
4 yrs. scanting only 5 months for M:T 3-11-8
paid at sundry times to E J Lees [underline]5-0-0[/underline]
(the last payment 5 mo: 1814) due 2-11-8
I wd be obliged to thee to enquire from her, how
far this acct. is correct M:T's. Magazines
appear to have been sent up to 8 mo. last
I also wish to know the amt. she paid
Lees since 5 mo. 1814 that we may debit him
accordingly"
