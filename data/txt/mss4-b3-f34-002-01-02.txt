Ballitore: 16/5 month 1784


My dear friend
        I sate [sic] down with an intent to write to my beloved daughter Peggy, but a beloved friend interfered among my feelings, & I thought I would send thee a salutation of my unfeigned love  I purpose (if all be well) to set off to-morrow for Dublin, in order to the Yearly Meeting  I am ^seem^ a poor, tottering, feeble creature: but as way has been aforetime made, & I have been helped along, so I humbly rely on the same ordering hand, & protecting care. It is well for us, my beloved friend, to centre [sic] here  To have Infinite Wisdom graciously to condes-cend [sic] to direct us, & Omnipotence to help us along, is certainly best & happiest for us  Known to the Almighty are our several habitations habits, dispositions & propensities  & he best knows how to modify, control, refine, & prepare, so as to make us ^all together (the whole lump [?]) that very thing which he would have us^ to be  I recollect, that in that freedom of communication which he would have us to be I almost always feel with thee in a peculiar manner, when there is opportunity for it, I have often found myself disposed to mention the usefulness, the necessity of experiencing our spirits to be reduced, & to magnify (if I may so say) humility of [page number] 108 of heart. It appears still to me to be the Kings gate at which we should reside, the door of entrance at which we should patiently wait  Where-ever others may be carried in the rovings of their vain imaginations; be this thy dwelling, & assuredly all will be well. Resign thyself in nothingness to the creating, forming, squaring hand of the great Architect, & I doubt not he will build thee up an holy temple to his praise, a temple wherein the daily sacrifice will be acceptably offered, & the incense of pure gratitude & thanksgiving will joyfully ascend, instead of mourning & lamentation. ++++
        My dear friend, dearly Farewell 
                Richard Shackleton
