Dear Mrs Leadbeater
I cannot spend one of my last lingering
Franks better than in thanking you for your kind Letter. Parliament
now on the Eve of dissolation, and whether M. Smith will again be
returned is quite uncertain, and if he should have that happiness, the period
when the privilege of franking is restored to the new members, is not yet
known to us, people seem to doubt about [insertion]it[/insertion], so we shall lie quiet both as to
recieving or writing for a short period, and single sheets are all that we
can secure till we [unclear][/unclear] or the papers give notice. Our correspondence
which is very immense, must now therefore suffer an interruption.
Tha fact is that W. Smith, who has been 43 years in Parliament
has just now in his advancement, told his Constituents, that he shall
esteem it amongst the highest honors of his life after the repeated
approbation that they have given to his conduct, if they should crown
that approbation by returning him their Representative in Parliament,
but that he declines all expence beyond what the Law requires

Thus situated the court must be uncertain. The House will be dissolved
on the 2nd. of June and then die all franks. You cannot think
My dear Mrs. Leadbeater what extreem pleasure your account of
Owen Fias has given me. I thank God that he is so good and so useful
a man. It is a fine description that you give of him. Your ....
and example must have been of the greatest advantage to him, and
I trust that he will continue to pursue a pious, pure, and humble
course of life. I am sincerely glad to hear that the Husband of
the elder Sister is reforming from his odious habits. What comfort
will he derive from the happy change. Pray be so kind as to take
the trouble to tell him from me, that I hope he will p[unclear][/unclear]
and change every other liquor for water only - He will I am
sure reap the most blessed effects from the change, and he may
then bring credit to the family with whom he is connected
instead of disgrace. I only recommend to hime what I practice

myself, water beeing my constant [unclear]brouage/beverage[/unclear].
I am much obliged by your kind enquiries after my numerous
family of [unclear]ten[/unclear] children four children in law and fifteen
Grand children. They are all upon the whole quite well
or at least as nearly so as from so large a circle could
be expected.
Sincerely wishing you all happiness
and comfort I remain
dear Mrs Leadbeater
Yours very sincerely
