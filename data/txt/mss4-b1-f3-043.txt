112			R. S. to his Wife
					London 6th [?] of Sixthmonth 1776
		*** I have been these two last nights at Edm: Burkeâ€™s, in Westminster. They have been very kind, and he is indeed an admirable man. ** I thank Divine Providence that my relish (I hope prevailing, uppermost, permanent relish) is for other things. Indeed, the distraction occasioned in the mind, by being of necessity occupied by two different objects, causes a disagreeable sensation in spiritual constitution weak as min. People may judge and think of me, some better, and perhaps some worse than I deserve; but He that sees in secret, at the same time that he knows my infirmities, and that I am as a reed shaken with the wind, see also, I trust, the sincerity of my heart, and prepares many an offering therein. ***
The more any of us are impregnated with the seasoning virtue of true religion, the more savoury is our conversation and mutual communication. And, indeed, all of us, young and old, have need, in each of our departments, to feel after and witness its efficacy: we want it for food, we want it for cleansing, we want it in prosperity to limit and preserve us, we want it in adversity to sustain and console us.
