Waterford 7mo 20th 1792
My dear Cousin
I am obliged by thy last kind favour
particularly as it relieved me from anxiety on account
of my Aunt I hope the complaint is entirely removed
I fear I shall not have an opportunity of seeing her
& the rest of you this year as some unavoidable occurences
have rivetted my shackles closer on me
It would give me pleasure to see thee filling a new
station which I have no doubt thou wilt grace
I highly approve of the plan you adopt & think
the agreeable intercourse of the village society will
be increased rather than injured by the change
The destination of S. Nevins for the meeting of Enniscorthy
gives me this opportunity of addressing thee
but I now find my time so limited that I am
at
Wm Rayner

most ashamed to send such a serah, but fear
should I suppress it my condemnation would be
greater than if I let it go forward - I hope
Cousin Debby has got over her trying time or
may in due course to the satisfaction of herself
& friends — Susan is on the wing so I must
hastily take leave — Thine
William Rayner
