To Sarah Shackleton
Ballitore 16th of 9th m. 1869
My dear aunt
I have long been waiting for an opportunity to write
to thee and at last a frank unexpectedly [underline]crossed[/underline] one: I gladly
catch it passing and set to write hard & fast lest it pass on
to some one else - I also have been long wishing to get a letter
from thee, perhaps I may yet have that pleasure, tho' heretofore
I wished in vain... Ben & Jane Haughton with their
lovely son Edmund John, have been with us since 2nd day
evening, they leave us to-day, to our great regret, Edmund
is a sweet boy - I'm sure thou'd love him he is very
free and goes to almost every one, but I have the [underline]honour[/underline]
to be a particular favourite. I went to the last month's
meeting at Carlow, in the Day Coach Ben, Jane & her
sister A. Alexander were my fellow travellers, so I was
well off & then Edmund got acquainted with me. I am
exceedingly fond of him. Ben is in good spirits and seems
to enjoy his visit a good deal; Jane is very agreeable &
quite free - the told Betsy a [underline]power [/underline] about the straw
work, which is going on[underline] smack smooth.[/underline] Mary Haughton
James & her son William are here too (I mean in Ballitore
they lodge at J. Bewley's) My uncle Abraham took them
all to Henry Harrington's yesterday Mary J. & Deborah
went also, and they [underline]all[/underline] dined here - [underline]uncle [/underline]& all. Henry
has got a great number of his pictures up, but has
many more without places to hang them in. -
As I know by experience it is very pleasant to hear
[underline]news[/underline] from home, I am trying to find out some for
thee, tho' I'm but a bad news monger - Mary Casey's
daughter-in-law has not lain-in yet tho' it is daily expected.
Many came here a few days ago and said she [underline]would[/underline]
be [underline]sick[/underline] that night, but Mary was mistaken: she wishes
for thy return; indeed so do we all & I hope it will soon take
place - Jane Hart is at Boakefield at present; whether

she will remain there long or no I can't inform thee, but this
I hear viz: [underline]she lie's in bed till two o'clock in the day.[/underline]
Emma Little has been very ill, but is now on the mending
hand — How art thou now? I expect thou hast quite got the
better of the last attack. Mary Farmer is very poorly
with an Erisypelas on her face, neck & head. She has kept
her bed several days & Dr Davis attended her. Poor woman
she is to be pitied, quite forlorn no female relative
or friend to comfort her; B. Preston pays her no attention
at all I hear; & she is very low-spirited. Mary Pike goes
next week to Mountmelick to Wm Garratt and Sally Gatchell's
wedding; it is to be a very large one I understand.
Wast not thou surprized to hear of it? I could scarcely believe
it at first. My father mother and aunt Higginson paid
their long promised visit to Bloomville, so [underline]who knows[/underline]
but we [underline]may[/underline] go to Munster: they found my uncle in pretty
good health and spirits. Little Hannah White is as engaging
as ever, but she is very shy: she was quite pleased
with Edmund kissed him over and over and walked holding
his hand up the garden walk. J. W. Boake [underline]walks alone[/underline]!!
I can perceive no other improvement in him. To be sure he is
(in his mother's eyes at least) a model of perfection. Molly
Haughton bitterly laments thy absence . I very often call
in to see her and constantly hear the voice of complaint.
She is hampered now about her coals - when they are bought
something else will come on the carpet. My cousins
continue to get on pretty well in the Shop tho' the Glove Trade
is rather slack just at present. However I hope it will revive
when the renovating breath of Spring is felt. I must leave
thee now my dear aunt though I would rather not, as some
one else will want to write to thee adieu then says thy
My mother bids me say that it was - Fisher
copied most of the verses for thee, he and all
the Limerick boys are well - Jacob Harvey finely.

My dear aunt -
clever answer to them but as an acknowledgement
of it. I prize much thy great sheet both as containing
so much information but as a testimony of the regard
which thou must have for me to weather thro' all difficult
thee to write so much - I have got a good many bundles
of prepared straw from Dublin & have prepared some myself
which looks better than what I bought but came much dearer
owing to the badness of the straw. I have taught Kitty
Neville this branch & if she finds it worth white I will buy the
bundles from her. Dont be uneasy about the flour not
arriving as there is not much demand for the like. Dont
be alarmed about thy letters for they are in my mothers care
& have not been read by any one. I dont think the bundle
was needed but don't remember. I know I looked thro' it for
M Harveys drawings thou mentioned & thought the bundle
was for us at first. How dost thou like H R White
I got the money from my Uncle & on giving it to TB he gave
me £5 which I have for thee & which FB thinks I had better
not mention to Abby - The sums flourishing since our
competition aros - I hope I & R Harvey are now satisfied.
about Jacob - a letter went before thine arrived, but a prize to hint
is kind & useful. Any further information about the
straw will be thankfully received. I still build upon
This short letter is not meant for a settled

MH's account as she has such large experience which might
answer me better than the accounts from individuals, but
that also is very useful - There 5 girls plaiting but I think
it is long before this plait will be worth 1d per yard - I need to
sell it as cheap as possible. I am dying straw for the mats
& have one girl plaiting for mats for my mother
I intend to write a news letter soon & am think much business
Ben Haughton's & Isabella's love to thee - Jane & Debby's dear
love. All long for thy return & J [unclear]Medhearts[/unclear] says she is
very angry with for staying so long - M H ditto -
Affectiontely thine ES
