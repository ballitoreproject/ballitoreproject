I have found so many comfortable reflections ensue
to my making a return to my Friends' obliging favours that
I have determined to strive to be more punctual than I have
been hitherto in acknowledging them not that I confess myself
to have been wilfully negligent at all for I often wished
to write when I could not effect it. I am much gratified
by the [underline]Petit morceau[/underline] of Poetry thy last contained &
flatter myself I shall enjoy a repetition of such favours now
& then since The Art of Poetry is found. I have not had
an opportunity of speaking to Becky Grubb since my last
nor do I think she is in town now as I have not seen her
in meeting this while past, besides I suppose her presence
is necessary at home as the Meeting of Clonmel approaches
Sam Grubb whom I met the other evening informed me that
my Uncle & Jonathan Haughton were expected there &
inspired me with a wish of going thither & probably I
may if none else of the family go but if I thought my
uncle

did not design to be there. I should be very easy about
it. I received a letter from him this day (which made no mention
of such an intent) & cannot but admire at his condescension
in taking my trifles in good part for they are so very
worthless that I am perfectly ashamed of them. I was much
concerned to hear of poor Owen Campbell's [insertion]death[/insertion], he was an obliging
affectionate man, & one I had a great regard for: his poor
little boy has a great loss of a tender, attentive father before
he can be sensible of it & it is much if he will not be
spoiled as his Mother can pay but little attention to
him engaged as she is a present. I am also concerned to
hear the fever has spread to Martin Whelan's family &
hope the consequence may not be fatal. What would my
Aunt do for a careful driver she might depend upon if
he should be taken off. Frank Johnson it seems has got
a longer furlough — May he be inspired with a resolution
of employing properly the time allotted him. Dost thou
recollect the English-man who was a boarder at Bob Hudson's.
he has come to pitch his tent in Waterford for a while
he

called upon me very politely when he came to let me
know you were all well: he speaks in grateful terms
of my Aunt's kindness & acknowledges his recovery [insertion]from a fever[/insertion]
pretty much owing to a prescription of hers. Pat &
Peggy are in the enjoyment of good health, Archibald
& his Spouse tolerably. I have an unlimited power
of presenting their best wishes when I write. Please
distribute my affectionate salutation to each individual
of the family & to all Friends who are kind enough
to inquire about me. I was pleased to hear of the little
Cherub's recovery from the Chink-cough & that little Peggy
is in such a thriving condition. Which of the boys is
most at favour now at the Retreat? Does Coote still
preserve his pre-eminence? If I mistake not Abby Widows
my good-natured friend has one or two pair of stockings
of mine which thou wilt be so obliging as to take into thy
possession & when a proper opportunity serves of conveying
them here, take advantage of it. Farewell.
I am thine with much affection
