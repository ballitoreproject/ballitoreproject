Mt.Mellick 29 of June 1794
Dear William
Yesterday I recievd your letter and
am sorry to hear you express yourself in the
manner you did. - I'll allow I'm too troublesome
but I assure you I cannot avoid it I cannot hear
my children cry without some feeling and I believe
you know I have no friend but you. I apply'd
to Wm. Beale and he'd advance me the money
with pleasure if you had wrote to him or if you
do by return of post he'll advance it which
would be of great use. T. Dugdill has not sold his
horse yet I believe he could be got for the value
If I could borrow money to pay for him for it is
better to pay even more than common interest
for a little money than let ones business lie
behind, I intend to call to Wm. Beale by return
of post and I expect he'll hear from you
for the present farewell Jn.o Leadbeater

date of last deed -
25th 4 mo. 1789
I take the opportunity of Writing by
a friend thats going to Ballitore and
I believe you may have the same
opportunity back again --
