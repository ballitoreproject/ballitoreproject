My dear Cousin,
	I am much gratified by thy kind, affectionate letter of 10th ult ultimate. Whatever thou mayst think of thy talents for letter writing, thy correspondence is always particularly pleasing to me. ++ Thou hast heard that it proved consistent with [pencil capitalized I & W on following words] Infinite Wisdom to remove out of this life our dear friend R. W. I was by his bedside when he breathed drew his last ^breath^: he seemed to go off exceedingly easy, with so little struggle that I could not for a time ascertain whether he was gone or not. This is a favour, but a still greater that there is a hope that he died in the Lord: he had been a visited young-man, & was religiously disposed. I was with him many times for several days before his departure & his expressions denoted a solid, awful sense of his approaching change: he reprobated in himself & others the eager pursuit of the world, & grasping at extensive gain, which was often disappointed (& particularly in his own case): he condemned that trade which consists in victualling armed ships in times of war, as supporting that unchristian practice, & utterly unlawful for those of our society to be concerned in. +++
	Though Religion is at a low ebb in many or most of the families of friends, yet I believe there is a seed up & down worth cultivating; & though in the line of this service (family-visits) one many at times be disappointed, finding things worse in some places than might be hoped; yet in other [page #] 82 places where little was expected, unexpected good was found: as the fruitful land has been turned into barrenness, so again the desert has rejoiced & blossomed as the rose. +++
	We have each of us ^need^ to guard against that particular sin or failing which most easily besets us, & to experience renewedly those baptisms, which cleanse from the defilements both of flesh & spirit. ++ Very uncertain indeed how long publick or private tranquility will continue; for my part I see little of this world certain but trouble: & there appears to me great necessity for each of us to dig deep, that we may get to that rock, on which we may safely build, even the revelation of Truth in the inward parts, & the feeling sense of its divine energy in the soul. ++
Thy truly affectionate friend & kinsman
Richard Shackleton
