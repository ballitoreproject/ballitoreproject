Dublin (94 Abbey Street) 5 Janry 1815
My dear Cousin
Within six hours of the close of the
old year I received a fresh instance that
the early traces of your kindness for me are
not obliterated. At that time in order
to expedite the winding up John Cummings
annual Accounts & if possible to retain his
employment I had a bed in his house
to which after spending 5 or 6 hours at the
desk I retired at 2 or 3 in the morning
this I continued for about three weeks but
his business was so multiplied that he could
not be satisfied without a constant attendant
he has therefore procured a person to commence
the year. I used to go to Ormond Quay at
6 o clock but have been prevented since

Sir W Caffe came to town for a temporary residence
as I have been obliged to devote
my evenings to him - I suppose his stay
will not be long protracted as his Lady
has presented him with a daughter a
few days ago. He tells me I must go
with him to Kilkenny on the 15th- which
I fear may occasion me the loss of my
remaining situation - however if so I shall
be at liberty to accept of a better- should
it offer. My daughter Mary is the one
we would consider the most suitable for
a separation from the family for improvement -
however the plan alluded to does
not completely agree with her mothers ideas
-she tells me the child is tolerably expert at
her needle & already capable of making some

of the articles you mentioned & several others that
could cut a figure in a shop & considers her
at present entitled to receive money for her service
instead of paying it. Suppose at the rate
of 5 Guineas for the year - we would also
be unwilling to engage her for a length of time
for fear any dissatisfaction should arise
& then we could not reclaim her without the
sacrifice of more money. Another substantial
obstacle is that I cannot muster 12 Guineas [unclear][/unclear]
to share from more urgent occasions.
if I could the disposal of
it should be another manner
to try to reduce a weight that hangs heavy
on me. Mary is 15 yeras old slender & stretching
up much inclined to stoop & will I fear
have a contracted chest & injure her health - if
she was to become delicate away from her parents
our minds would be a constant prey to uneasiness.
I wish you had an opportunity of knowing her
You have not been in town since we came
Our love to all friends
