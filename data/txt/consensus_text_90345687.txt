and the very motley crowd who were
quickly pouring in through the doors.
Many of the ladies were in half
dress "demi toilette" but the majority

Lord Wrottesly, William Harvey, Macquorry
Bamkine, and several others whom I

does not appear, quarter of an hour
and now the expecting audience manifest

of impatience: what can be keeping
them! Romney Robinson goes [deletion]out[/deletion] over
and whispers something to Nelson
Hancock who seems to be one of the
prime movers; he disappeared and
knew were, Romney
