From the same to the same


Manchester, 22/6 month 1781

+++ Farewell, my ever dear friend - The God of all comfort be with thee to thy comfort! And be not wanting to thyself in making use of these innocent, necessary, profitable gratifications which an all-wise, benign and merciful Being has allotted thee to enjoy. The delights in a cheerful Receiver, as well as a cheerful Giver - and the letting the animal spirits sink below the right tone is hurtful to the mind as well as the body.
