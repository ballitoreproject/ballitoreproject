From Richard Shackleton to Richard Jacob

Ballitore 20th of 4th month 1774

Dear Richard,

	Please let thy father know that I was ^am^ favoured with his long & kind epistle, for which am obliged to him +++
	Last second-day morning our dear friend & kinsman Joseph Thompson was found dead in his bed, having been the night preceding (to all appearance) in good health & spirits. It is supposed that he died in his sleep, as his wife, who lay with him did not perceive it till she arose.
	This, among many instances, dear child, shews how watchful & circumspect we should be in our conduct, & that we should never recline ourselves to rest without collecting our thoughts & waiting for a capacity to recommend ourselves to the Divine Protection: so uncertain is the tenure of our existence here. +++
		
	Thine affectionately.
		Richard Shackleton
