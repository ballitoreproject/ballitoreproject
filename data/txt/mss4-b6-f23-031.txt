In verdant beauty smiles the vale
The flowers their richest hues display
The fragrant Hawthorn scents the gale
and Birds sing sweet on every spray
gladly
we catch [deletion]with joy[/deletion] the Cuckoo's cry
That cry which welcomes Summer [unclear]bright[/unclear]
But the coy Stranger soon shall fly
and fond regret pursue her flight
Torn shall the hawthorns blossoms fade
The flowers their beauteous heads recline
M L 1809
Soon shall the hawthorn blossom fade
The flowers their beauteous heads
