Maurice, farewell, [insertion]& o'er[/insertion] around thy head
May Heaven a sacred shelter spread,
Should it be thine the lance to wield
Victorious in the embattled field
May Mercy's voice an entrance find
With [insertion]in[/insertion] thy feeling generous mind
And bid thee soothe the sorrows of thy kind
