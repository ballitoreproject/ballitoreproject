Hotel Wagram Paris
Saturday 2[underline]nd[/underline] June 66
Since writing enclosed Albert
proposes I should stop a
week with Florence on
my way back to Ireland
This is a plan that
never once entered my
head I felt the sooner
I get back to Ireland & to
Dunlavin the better, he
now desires me to mention
it to you & for you to write
by [underline]morning mail on[/underline]
[underline]Monday[/underline] & direct to Mrs. Burrs
11 Queens Square Bloomsbury
London W. C. saying what you
advise as he goes back to
Ireland that night -, I told
Uncle A to have a letter [underline]there[/underline]
for me then saying if he
were still in London, I might
have him back with me but
it is 10 chances to one I will

go back alone, I did it before
A- thinks I want a few
days quiet he dont know
how I kept up as well as I
did - I cant say I wish to
stay - I dont know whether it
would do me any good
or not, having nothing to do
to be left [underline]thinking[/underline], & perhaps
gaging on that child Bertram
it might do me more harm
than good, - & yet for other
reasons it might be advisable
to stay behind supposing
it was only for 4 days -
Tell me what you think
& wd advise - what ever
you say I'll do, It is all
one to me what I do now
besure to write by morning mail
[underline]Monday to Mrs Burrs[/underline] -
