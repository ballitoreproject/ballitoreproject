paper for thee but as it is thou canst obtain the [unclear][/unclear]
from Rebecca - I have no doubt you all feel a pang in
the privation of the deceased but her anchorage in a
better ocean must be contemplated - I hope our sister Margaret
bears the event with Calmness her own difficulty of breathing
has been very trying - she & cousin Watson were able to salute
each other in the Truth - there cannot be a doubt that when
the summons comes for either of them they will be received
by him who could in addressing the Father declare[deletion]d[/deletion] "Thy
[unclear][/unclear] is Truth" - The events of this new year have
been [unclear][/unclear] lessons to the dear young people intending to
marry - I have felt very much for them - what may [unclear][/unclear]
occur is known only to the Omnipotent disposer - There [unclear][/unclear]
many sources of solicitude to bear thee down but thou art
not ignorant of the help which arises from the divine
hand - My love salutes thee & thy near connections -
did my family know of my addressing thee they could unite - in
grateful love to thee - Dearly farewell -
Sarah Grubb
15th the marriage is accomplished very
agreeably, a large place gathering M W
much better in Testimony & Prayer - our Sister
was praing yesterday
Mr. Watson desires love to
thee & thy Elizabeth
