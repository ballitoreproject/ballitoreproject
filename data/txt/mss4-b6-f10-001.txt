Carlow, 9th month 2nd 1788
My dear Mary Shackleton,
Thy favor by the bearer came just appropos
as thy trunk & box - arrived only last evening
together with a Qr. Cask wine - all wch. I send by the
bearer, know not what charges attend, as have not
settled with the boat man - we are pleased to hear
you have so good Company at the Retreat, but
concern'd to hear some of them are Invalids. It
is no new thing for you to be feasted - nature
has formed your dwelling for attraction - we
are so [unclear]reserved[/unclear] in these times as not to be
able to lay such treats - My wife & I wd rejoice
to see Co: Nancy Pike & her Children here, if she
be so inclined this is the time - I wd send for
thine by [unclear][/unclear] me the time - we have
been [unclear][/unclear] with visitors today & yesterday viz
some of wood-hill family.[unclear] [/unclear]-hill &
[unclear][/unclear] &c. Co. H. Dunhill & some of hers
now here - nothing very new or strange worth
communicating - we have got our son Ben
here - he is quite delighted, he slept with me
last night - and was so riotous - that I have
not yet recover'd the loss - we have at last

some prospect of an agreeable place for Ben Wilson
Viz John Newsoms Cork - the affair is now in Negotiation -
and I have wrote his mother & have all
things in readiness - I had a letter from Dr Sally
Grubb a few days ago advising of the School expected
to be opened . 20th Inst: abt wch. time I propose taking
my Daughter there - She & Mary Dudley &c. bravely
after their arduous employment - have since
wrote to her - and Hailed them on their safe arrival
when I began I had no intention of saying half so
much - believe I had best, since have gone so
far to fill this side -
My Dr Jane still very poorly. The
Pain is abated - but at times very troublesome -
my Doctrine to her is Resignation & Patience. if
you have any Better at Ballitore - shall gladly
embrace it - all outward applications seem useless
Our Dear love attend Mary & Jane - also S. [unclear]Spavold[/unclear]
on first sight of him - before I knew who he was
I felt love for him - tell him I hope he will
submit his [insertion]own[/insertion] will - to the will of the great Master - who
has occasion for him - and many more - who are

following after [unclear][/unclear], - The world is my
grand Enemy - the [unclear][/unclear] things of it, are to some
unlawful - I have been deeply wounded by it - not
alltogether the [unclear]love[/unclear] of it - but the accumulated
incumbrances - some of them my own seeking,
& others thrown in my way. -
Conclude with Dr Love to all your
family - in wch. my Jane & Sister Unite with
thy Very affectionate Cousin

my Pen is bad believe thou canst scarce read it

match I coud get
