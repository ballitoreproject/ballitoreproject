Dr. Sir.
I arrivd here at 4 O'Clock the Same day
I parted with your beautiful retreat; and for
any business that I have done since, I might
as well of stay'd a few days longer; Hamilton
on settling with us, & giving up his trust to my
brother and I has Charg'd us Interest upon
Interest, for every shilling his brother advanc'd
In short he is behaving so [underline]rascally[/underline] a part, that
I have not patience to give you a detail of
the whole; shall defer it untill our next meeting.
I send enclosed the Copy of one of the letters
I have written to Peggy. from St. Lucia it was
some time in the year 1779: It is to Molly. I send
it; for it is rather incorrect for your inspection.
There is no sort of news here but the hourly
expectation of the Duke of Rutland; great
preparations are making for his reception.
I hope Aby has join'd you before this; and
in good health; my Compliments to him.
My brother joins me in Love and affection
to you & Mrs. S. & all the family. and
believe me yrs. Sincerely
Thos. Eyre
