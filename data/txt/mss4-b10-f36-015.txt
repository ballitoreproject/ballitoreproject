Glendruid 3/19th 1833
My dear Eliza
As I know thou wilt be anxious to hear
of us (although the time is but short since thou
left us), I begin, tho I have but little to tell thee
either pleasant or unpleasant, we are all well
here. My mother I think seems better She
is busy at her out door work when the weather
is fine, which is not very often. We had a
note from Lucy last night saying [unclear]Emmy[/unclear]
was not very well, poor little thing I suppose
she minds the difference between being here
and in town. She also mentioned Edward
eye not being well, He is not yet gone to England
the rest of the people are well as far as I know.
We are getting on here just as usual not
troubled with [underline]many[/underline] visitors, nothing new
has happened since thou went. no one
came near us on the first day but Fredric, he
then came out that morning to breakfast.
how did he like Ballitore for it is hard to
find out any thing from him. was he as

[unclear]grumphie[/unclear] as usual or entertaining.
I am glad thou got down with so little fatigue
it was a great advantage and thou so badly
 able to bear exertion. how dost thou feel now
or art thou settled for I think one takes two
or three days to settle down before one feels
pleasant, I hope thou wilt do nothing to
get cold or tire thyself but will stay quiet &
enjoy Cousin Betsy's snug fireside, it is a nice
snug little room thou hast got to sleep in
 and if thou wants any thing at night Elizth
is near to thee. give my love to her, and tell
her to take care of thee. I must stop for
she is come for this to bring it to the post
and perhaps my Mother has something
to write. give my love to Cousin Betsy
and believe thine sincerely Selina
