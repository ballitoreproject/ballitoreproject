Isabel to church; just before setting
out who should arrive but [deletion][/deletion]
Richard Shackleton to escort his sister
to church so we three went together -
He had been invited to dinner
but was preengaged to the Pims -
On our way home he had to part
with us to set off for Bray & catch
the train - so we were greatly occupied
just as we were strolling up the brows
to see him and Charlie on before us -
They had met and Char told him
he would never have time to catch the
train and made him come back -
After dinner we walk over to
Ballyman - the evening was lovely
the views splendid and the walk
[underline]very[/underline] pleasant. [underline]very[/underline] [underline]very[/underline]
18 Monday - Isabel went away
and very lonely we felt without her
and very lonely we feel without her

21 Thursday - Lyd and I went to
town early this morning as we were
