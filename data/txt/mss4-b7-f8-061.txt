Waterford 23 Dec 1800
With great pleasure I met a few days
since an old friend of the family because
she has always met me with a friendly
aspect because she brought me good tidings
from Ballitore & because she offered to
be the bearer of a letter to my dear Cousin
Mary I wished for such an opportunity
as what I had to communicate I did
not think worth the expense of portage
I deferred writing from time to time in
the hope of being enable to say I had
collected the Amount of the Books which
I am sorry to remark is not yet the
case _ I have undertaken the business
of so many that I can call no time my

own as one or other of my employers
is constantly urgent about his proper
concerns I endeavour as well as I can
to satisfy all & so am kept in abound
of occupations - but I must endeavour
to keep the wolf from the door as
my family is large consisting of my
wifes father almost super annuated
& two grown up daughters along with our
own flock the eldest Eliza approaches
to the age of fourteen & is very large of
her age the others follow in succession
at the interval of about two years and
all are well able to take their allowance
of bread. The Books all arrived
safe & were delivered with the exception

of two or three the payment for which
I doubted as soon as I get the price
shall write again. I fear this being
late or would now enlarge
Believe me your Sincerely

Mary Leadbeater

I was too late by three minutes & now
forward it as an extenuation
