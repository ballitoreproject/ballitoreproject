Dear Friend & Cousin
			From my own feelings, I trust that our short Acquaintance hath fixed a mutual & lasting Regard, in that Love which is durable & faileth not, tho we be, as to the Present, fallible finite Creatures; in a Sense where of at this time measurable flowing towards thee & thine, I dearly salute every one of you with fervent Breathings to the Author & Dispenser of all Good for the Continuation of your Health both of Body & Mind, & for yours & my own Improvement & Advancement in that Knowledge which is perfect & saving; I have often remembered you in my goings along, & about the time, as I suppose by thine, thou wast looking out for a Letter, I had intended ^writing to^ informing thee of Things that were past, but Things present prevented me. From the sick-bed & Grave of a dear & valuable Friend, to whom my Spirit was nearly united, I made a quick transition to another mournful Scene, I was hastened home with all expedition & arrived but just in time to take the last leave of a dying Father; he then perfectly knew me, but was no longer capable of Conversation, & continued only three Days, his Disorder a slow Fever, his interment was the same Day of the Week following after that of dear William Hunt; it was an afflicting trying season, to be thus suddenly bereaved of an affectionate tender Parent; here, tho incapable of doing it justice, I hope thou wilt indulge me, & excuse my attempting to draw the out-lines of an amiable character; as it is the first so it probably may be the last time, I am no Panegyrist. Having engaged early in Business & had extensive commercial Connections he was well known, & being just & honourable in his Dealings, & of a free, affable generous Disposition of Mind, he was deservedly well esteemed by the worthy of all Ranks, he had a chearful pleasant turn in Conversation which rendered his Company generally acceptable & often courted; yet, besides a good common-wealths Man, he was a serviceable ^Member^ of our Society, being well spirited for the good Cause, a constant Attender of Meetings, & strenuous for the support of Discipline & maintenance of good Order in the Church; not without Authority, being uniformly steady & exemplary in his own Conduct & Deportment; in fine, he was an open-hearted sincere friend, a religious, upright, honest Man. in him I had hoped to find comfort after the loss of so dear a Friend, but he also was called home; I was not suffered to confide in Man, nor to lean upon anything for Consolation short of Christ the true Rock & Resting Place; & ever praised be the holy Name for he was mercifully pleased to draw near in the time of deep trouble, or I should surely have sunk too low; an unfavourable account was also brought of my Father Bradford, who had long been poorly but was then worse, which called me to Lancaster immediately after, lest I should no more be favored to see him in Mutability; he has ever been to me a tender & affectionate Parent, & treated one as an own Son, as well since as before the Decease of his beloved Daughter; he is detained here yet a little longer, closely confined to his Chamber in a weak Condition bodily, but fresh & lively as ever, near to Heaven as is possible on Earth; it is good to be with him; I have an Aunt also, an Uncles Widow, whose 6 children, 5 yet living, were left under my Fathers & my Care next to her; she is in a precarious state of Health, not expected to continue long; I am through mercy, kept pretty even, & my Son, from whom I lately heard, is well, & the rest of my Relations are tolerably I think; But I have yet to mention the Decease of another valuable Friend, John Woolman from New Jersey, he was taken ill & died of the Small-pox at York, or to use his own Words, departed this Life, this he deemed more expressive, or better adapted to the Nature of the Change, it being only a removal or passing of the Soul, which can never die, from this State of Probation to an abiding Place forever; I remember his making this Distinction in the yearly-meeting; he seemed to have a Path to walk in almost peculiar to himself, & was singular in his Conduct & Conversation as well as dress amongst Men, but his Judgement was clear & just, his Sentiments good, & his Doctrine sound; he advanced nothing that he could not maintain with propriety of Argument founded on Scripture and Christian Principles; I will transcribe a short sketch of his Character as it appeared in one of our News-papers, the author unknown. Last Wednesday (10 month 7th) died at York, of the Small Pox, Mr. John Woolman of New Jersey in North America, an eminent Preacher amongst the People called Quakers: His Life exhibited a very singular & striking Example of Humility & Self Denial adorned with an amiable Sweetness of Disposition & affectionate Goodwill to Mankind universally: His Feelings for the Bondage & Oppression of the poor distressed Negroes were so exquisite, that he conscientiously refused every Accomodation [sic], both in Diet and Apparel, which was produced by their Labour: He was upon a Religious Visit to his Friends in this Nation, & has left a Wife & Family in America -- He had traveled little in this Nation, save in our County, where his chief Concern seemed to lay, & to his Friends of which his Certificate was more particularly addressed -- May it please the Almighty to bless the Labours of these his Ministers & Elders. Instruments that he had so nobly qualified, seeing they are now removed from us, & have sealed their Testimonies with their Lives: I do trust the Impressions made on the Minds of many will be lasting: Dear William Hunt, little as he might appear in the undiscerning Eye, was a Man richly endowed with many good Qualifications; he had a strong natural understanding, with deep penetration, was exceedingly agreeable & instructive both in conversation & in the gallery, for his spiritual gifts were large; in short, he was an able Minister, & a great & good Man, to thee who knew him well, I need not enlarge, thou likewise art sensible of the Loss the Church & Society in general have sustained; but next to his Widow & children (8 in Number) & his poor Nephew Thomas Thornbrough, it hath seemed to fall particularly heavy on me; he was to me as a Father too in a religious sense, my Spirit was closely united to him, & his no less to me, tho so poor a Thing; I was ever conscious of mine Inferiority & unworthiness; well hast thou styled him our Elder Brother in the Truth notwithstanding his Youth. We have had cause to mourn the removal of many worthies of late of great Eminence & Abilities, but not for them, for blessed are the Dead that die in the Lord --- their Works do follow them for ourselves & for our Children we must mourn, but he that commanded, also promised to send the comforter.	We were four in Company to Holland, William Hunt, Thomas Thornbrough, Samuel Emlen & I; our Passage over was easy & our Reception agreeable at Amsterdam, where the few Friends chiefly are, but as to our Services I am scarcely able to describe them. We had several Meetings amongst them, at these Strangers were frequently present; but S.E. had the chief Opportunities in Public whilst he continued with us, just a week, during which several visits were paid to the Friends in their Families, also an Opportunity taken with one Adrian Hope, not a Professor; but a Merchant of the first Note in Europe, Grandson, as I remember, to old John Claus, a worthy Public Friend, one of the First there; he received us courteously & took the Advices delivered by Samuel & William in friendly part; their principal tendency was to moderate the care for worldly & to increase that for heavenly Riches ^with^ reference to the Examples of his Predecessors, to his Grandfathers particular, who was eminent in both Relations, a rare Instance! but this poor Mans Life seems buried in the self, of which he has abundance, his Religion & chief Enjoyment, like a true Dutchman, consisting altogether in amassing Wealth, Wealth, more more their ^bestowed^ Places of Worship are the Exchange & Counting-house & their most earnest Devotion is paid to Guilders & Stivers. When Samuel returned we accompanied him to Rotterdam, where we had a small Meeting to pretty good satisfaction amongst a few of the Towns People, who behaved well; we afterwards visited some Religious-minded People at different Places, who have no particular Mode of Worship, nor do they ever assemble together or with others on a Religious Account, professing only that Worship which is inward & spiritual, & may best be performed alone, as they think; it seems there are several such scattered up & down, some quite retired, & secluded in a manner, from the World; much nearness was witnessed to some of these that we saw, & their company was pleasant, their countenances indicating with whom they had been. We also had a Meeting at Twisk in North Holland, where is only one antient Man professing with us, & an innocent good sort of a Man he is I think, but there is Congregation of religious sober People, a kind of Baptists I believe; however they freely gave us an opportunity with em, which proved a favoured one, both William & Thomas had testimonies to bear against that Ministry which is from without, in the will of Man, not in the Power of God, recommending to Silence & the Light within for true Teaching; they have a neat Meeting House in the Manner of Friends, without any Rostrum or exalted Place, but I observed a large Dutch Bible lying in a Corner; note, these are not Menonites [sic] or Menists; we dined at one of their Houses, & at another we drank Tea, here we had a small time of Silence, & William dropt a few Sentences very comfortable & encouraging to the honest & well-minded amongst them, several having followed us to this Place, he was also weightily concerned in supplication, and the good Master was pleased to own with his Divine Presence to the reaching the Witness in some & convincing, tho they knew not the Words, that he still remained to be a God hearing Prayer; John van der Werf, a Friend of Amsterdam was with us there & at most Places as Interpreter of the Testimonies, & in Conversation: There is no Meeting of Friends but at Amsterdam, & this very small, consisting of about 10 or 12 at most, some of them antient; they hold a Monthly-meeting for Discipline, but little appears to subsist amongst em, it fell out whilst we were there, which was just three weeks from going into & coming out of the Texel: Notwithstanding the Fewness of their Number & their low Estate, I believe all returned well pleased that we had given up our time to pay this Visit, believing it was required; for my part I was glad, tho I went but as a Servant, to attend upon em; & dear William several times expressed his satisfaction in the undertaking whilst there & afterwards, saying he found great Peace in having performed it, Holland being much on his Mind before he left his native Land; & it is remarkable that after our arrival at Newcastle he could see no farther; he said all seemed closed, asking if I did not find it so, which was indeed the Case, for I could then see no way to move, tho when we embarked my Intention was to proceed as directly homewards as I could after landing: Our Passage back was tedious & rough, my companions were both sick, Thomas confined to the Bed 4 Days & Nights, & William had little respite, tho he kept mostly on Deck in the Daytime; we took shipping for Scarbro but were driven to the Northward, nigh under the Chiviott Hills when first we saw Land, however we made shift to get back into Tine-month Haven, & landed at North Shields on third day the 25th of the 8 month being the sixth from our coming on board: We had a Meeting at Shields the next day, in which Thomas appeared with an affectionate call to the youth, inviting them to seek early after durable riches; & was seconded by William in a lively Manner, he concluding with an Alarum to the Aged, whose Treasure was in this World, sufficient to rouse aught that had an Ear but a stock or stone; we went to James Kings near Newcastle the same Evening, all seemingly in good Health considering our Fatigue, attended their Meeting the next-day, & the day following being sixth, we paid several visits to Friends in the Town; William complained in the Morning of Pain in his Head & Bones, which he attributed to cold taken at Sea, but growing worse in the Day we hastened home earlier that Evening than intended, & he went directly to Bed, ill of the small Pox, as it proved; no Eruption was discoverd til Second Day, but he was exceedingly ill during the Interval & continued so to the last with but little Intermission; he departed on Fourth Day the 9th ultimate about 3 in the Morning; he bore up under a heavy Load with great Fortitude & Patience, tho often in much pain, desiring nothing more as he said, than that the Lords Will might be done; being informed towards the End, on his making enquiry, that the Disorder was near the Height, his Reply was It is a trying Time, but my Mind is above it, blessed be the Lord and it was evidently so; Thomas Thornbrough removed to another Friends House at his Uncles request to avoid the Infection, so I took his place, & alternately with Elizabeth Coates, a Neighbouring Friends Wife, attended Night & Day til the Conflict ceased; an eminent Physician & an Apothecary were called in, & nothing left short that could be procured or done for his help that we know of, the family all of it being very kind and assiduous, of which dear William was sensible, expressing his Thankfulness, as we had cause to do likewise, that such a Place was provided, for we once expected to be cast on the High-lands of Scotland; the Fever ran high at times yet we seldom discovered any Signs of delirium, but lest it might prove otherwise with him, one Evening in the beginning he called me to him, & in a sweet but affecting manner expressed himself to this effect -- Dear Morris! be not alarmed at what I am about to say, but I have a Request to make that (as it is not impossible) if I should not be suddenly taken off thou write to my Wife & inform her that all is well; give my dear Love to her & the Children, to whom my last farewell Advice is, that they be careful to improve the Hints which I have frequently given them for their Conduct & endeavored to instill respecting the best Things, both when present with them, & since I have been absent bodily -- at another time, speaking of our Journey he said. How wonderful are the Pointings and Allotments of Right Wisdom when attended to! How unexpectedly we are cast here, before Scarbro, Sunderland as once proposed, or any other Place, in this House too, but it is right; & to look now at thy Engagement here how it has come about; is it not strange that amongst all the Friends we have been with in England thou only shouldst be pitched on, that we should speak to none beside thee, to go with us into Holland; but thou hadst no Engagements nor Ties, as to the Things of this World to hinder: it hath indeed appeared to me providential on my own account as well as theirs, & I have thought that if my being freed from Business, & so set at Liberty, was for the sake of this only it was enough: As something singular, tho self is concerned here also, to thee I may relate it, that during a severe Struggle he had about 36 Hours before the last, his situation appearing critical for a considerable space, my Mind, fearful of the Event, was much affected, & from the feelings of my Heart I was led to query, saying within myself, surely my Affection for him is far beyond the Love of Women; -- & he, just at the time getting a little easier & composed, looked up (for he never was blind) & replied, as if he had heard or perfectly understood my thoughts. Is that my dear little Morris? How united in Heart were David & Jonathan! Dost not thou think this is a pretty Passage of Scripture? I remember I was fond of reading it when a Youth. About this time I received the alarming Account from home of my dear Fathers being taken dangerously ill; thy Mind will more easily suggest than my Pen describe the Straight this brought me into, the difficulty & distress  must it not be a straight Place? I consulted my Friends & I weighed the matter as well as I could in my own Mind; at length I seemed easiest to wait the issue of another Night, believing it would one way or the other, if not set me at Liberty, at least determine the Point more clearly, whether it were best to go then or to stay a little longer, & so it proved; William indeed was not in a condition fit to be acquainted with the occasion if I had concluded to go directly, nor was it safe to leave him uninformed, as he was become uneasy in my Absence if at any time longer than he expected when I left the room: I believe from several circumstances after he was seized that he was sensible of his approaching Dissolution, & he was resigned, being prepared  O blessed situation! Sixth Day forenoon being fixed for Interment, I staid to perform the last office to the Remains of my dear deceased friend; after the grave was closed, which was thought proper first to be done on account of the disorder, there was a large solemn Meeting held, & several moving Testimonies born, both suiting the occasion & the situation of the People; setting forth in a clear & lively manner, that the true Gospel Ministry is still ^in Mercy^ continued, Preachers and Teachers being sent forth at this Day to teach all Nations with that Teaching that baptizeth, in & by the same Power evidently, as the Disciples formerly were; being, like them, and willing to leave every near & dear connection & all Possessions, Wife & children Houses & Land, & taking as it were their Lives in their Hands to go ^notionly [?]^ to visit their Brethren ^but^ to preach the gospel to the churches & People in distant Lands; instancing the present Example, who had almost from his childhood given up a large portion of his time to Labour to the Service of his great Lord & Master by whom he was called to the Ministry in the 15th Year of his Age, & had then laid down his Life therein at the Distance of some Thousand Miles from his outward Habitation, where he had left all those Things; & that many more were likewise at that time engaged in the same Service, counting all things but loss & dung that they may win Christ: As the deceased dwelt near the Lord in his Day, so was our God, in great Condescension, pleased to own with his Presence at the Close thereof, & to manifest his glorious Power in an eminent manner amongst us in that Assembly; praised be his Name for ever. Poor dear Thomas is gone to London proposing to sail for New York shortly with Samuel Emlen; he favoured us with his Company a while since his Loss, which he is enabled to bear with becoming Patience, but he is very thin; I delivered thy Message, which he accepted kindly & desired his dear Love might be remembered when I wrote. Our Friends Sarah & Deborah Morris, from Philadelphia, passed through Settle after our last Quarterly-meeting to those of Kendal & Lancaster, they have been in Cumberland since & now are in Northumberland; thine is the last account I have received concerning Robert Willis: Out of Seven Friends from America in the Service of Truth, all in this Nation at the time of the Yearly-meeting in London, six of them publick; Two are taken away by the Small Pox, viz, William Hunt & John Woolman; two are very antient, Robert Willis & Sarah Morris, she but weakly; & Samuel Emlen is in a poor State of Health: In answer to thy Queries. I do not recollect to have heard William mention receiving a Letter from or writing to thee; Tho the Remembrance of thee & thine in much nearness, frequently afforded subject of agreeable converse. Probably he received it in London; I have enquired of S. Fothergills Nieces for the Fragment desired, particular search has been made for it, but no such thing found amongst his Papers; he destroyed many not long before he died; as to M Fletcher, I have heard nothing of her lately; I just received a Letter from Cousin S Hall with a poor Account of Father, at whose House she is much to the satisfaction of dear Mother & Sister, for whom she is agreeable Company at this time; I was at Lancaster soon after the receipt of thy Favour, delivered the Inclosures & communicated the different Messages of Love, &c. as desired, which were acceptable; S. H. I suppose has wrote Letters to some of thy Family since: Our two Women Friends arrived safe from Ireland, I have seen neither of em, tho Margaret is of our Monthly-meeting, she has been ill since her return, but is now better; we think it was a pity they did not go through with their visit, yet we esteem them honest Friends, & I hope their Peace is insured.
	I was pleased to find that you were all well; I hope thou hast cleared thy Head, ere now, & washed thy Hands; many besides thee have been lead into Mistakes about Mortar; Please to give my dear Love to thy Wife & all thy Children, to thy Sister & Cousin Carleton; (I admire the Mill full as much as the Retreat) to John Gough & his Family; to Joseph & Betty Pike; (may tell Joseph I lately sent him a few Yorkshire Pikes by way of Hull) & to Thomas Greer; if thou happenest to remember when thou seest them:
		I remain thy affectionate, sincere Friend

P.S. I have not yet received the Manuscript from W. Rathbone but am nevertheless obliged by thy kind Remembrance; I intend to enquire after it & if I get it in time may send a Copy to T.J. When this gets to hand I presume thou wilt be my Debtor. N.B. I chose my sheet by the Size not the Edge.
