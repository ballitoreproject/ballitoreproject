Yes I have comforts - tho' a life
of sorrow has been mine.
And thro' the darkness of my fate
The beams of mercy shine.
I was a wife in early youth,
And he who won my hand
Loved wandering rather than his home
And died in foreign land.
My Lucy just from childhood grown
As good as she was fair
She was my pride & my delight,
The solace of my care.

A fever came - I saw its rage
Upon my darling prey,
I saw her die - [deletion]I[/deletion] saw that [insertion]fair[/insertion] form
Consign'd to kindred clay.
A deadly blight o'er Mary's frame
My hapless Mary past,
My heart was wrung - & low she [deletion]bowed[/deletion] [insertion]bent[/insertion]
Beneath the cruel blast.
Yet hope return'd & whisper'd soft
That all might yet be well-
W[deletion]T[/deletion]hen in the suffocating stream
My hapless Mary fell.
I saw her dead - nor [deletion]did [/deletion] [insertion]had[/insertion] my [deletion]heart[/deletion] [insertion]breast[/insertion] 
Receiv'd her parting sigh
Nor was my youngest, stripling boy
To cheer his mother nigh
Sad were the parting kiss & tear,
And boding thoughts arose,
When Owen sail'd beyond [insertion]across[/insertion] the main
To fight his country's foes
One son remain'd - a wife & babes
depending on his care,
yet with his widow'd mother John
His home & board would share
Again that scourge, a fever came,
The tender blossoms fade,
But to a place where mercy dwells
The children are convey'd.
It is the hour (may blessings rain
On those who guide [deletion]pl[/deletion] the plan)
Where pure benevolence extends
Her aid to suffering man

Now all day long - oft thro' the night
My son his shuttle plies
His only wish for those he lov'd
Subsistence to provide
Alas he fails - his trembling hand
No more the shuttle plies,
On his low bed the husband, sire
In feverish anguish lies,
"Desire me not this spot to leave
I feel my end is near,
* And I my latest looks would rest
on those for ever dear."
With generous heart & well-tried skill
The kind physician came
And watch'd the progress of disease
Upon the wasted frame.
* Nor do my latest looks bereave
Of those for ever dear
Alas these generous cares were vain
My Johnny sank to rest
And [deletion]that good heart,[/deletion] [insertion]cold was that[/insertion] industrious hand
[deletion]O surely they were blest.[/deletion]
And cold that faithful breast
Mine was a life of toil - but now
Sad, feeble & dismay'd
And aged - I would not oppress
Those whom I could not aid
In love we parted - sisters kind
To me their succour gave,
And quiet now I contemplate
The prospect of the grave,
For with a progress scarce perceiv'd
All o'er my hapless head,
A cancer with resistless power
It's fatal [underline]fibres[/underline] [insertion]toils had[/insertion] spread
Yet still a pittance I can earn,
My wheel can briskly move,
And friendly neighbours [underline]testify[/underline] I discern
Their pity & their love. Your. . your

[insertion]You[/insertion] [underline]They[/underline] say no murmur 'scapes my lips
No cloud o'erspreads my brow
[insertion]You[/insertion] [underline]They[/underline] say instruction & delight
From my poor converse flow.
For this be His the praise who gave
The power to bow resign'd,
And [underline]cheer'd[/underline] [insertion]soothed [/insertion]with native, calm center
The sorrows of my mind.
And oft I thank parental care
For many a mental treat
For much the letter'd page I love
Oh 'tis a solace sweet.
I lived in peace with humankind
And when I yield my breath
Some generous tear-drops shall lament
The childless widow's death.
Aye childless! - for my Owen dear,
My sweet, engaging boy! -
I must withdraw my thoughts from him
Else [deletion]they[/deletion] t'would my peace destroy.
For since my Owen left these arms
Eighteen long years are [deletion]fled[/deletion] sped,
No tidings come to cherish hope -
Oh surely he is dead.
Why, soldier, dost thou lift our latch?
Thy garb renews my pain -
Oh spare a mother's aching heart -
Good soldier, turn again.
See, with clasp'd hands & quivering lips,
How mute & sad & still
He gazes on me - yet those looks
They cannot menace ill.
Methinks that face I once have seen -
Oh no! - it cannot be -
He weeps - those tears disclose the truth -
My Owen! - yes, tis he!
Again these arms entwine my neck,
Where oft[deletion]en true[/deletion] [insertion]before[/insertion] they clung,
He speaks - but foreign tones disguise
My Owen's native tongue.

As flies before the morning beam
The gloomy shades of night,
So at thy presence all my woes
Begin to take their flight. 
Thy love cannot arrest the foe
Which works my life's decay,
But thou wilt trim the expiring lamp
And watch the latest ray.
O Thou, to whom my varied life
My sufferings all are known,
I praise thee, for this cordial drop
Now is my portion thrown
She ceased - she rais'd [insertion]her eyes[/insertion] to heaven
Dimm'd with the thankful tears
And strong emotions swell'd her breast,
And gratitude sincere
Earth could not give [deletion]so[/deletion] [insertion]a[/insertion] dear[insertion]er[/insertion] amend
By faith & patience won
Than her's, while thro' his alter'd form
She sees her long lost son.
Changed is his voice, his face, his form,
But changed is not his heart.
There filial love has fix'd [deletion]the[/deletion] [insertion]its[/insertion] throne
Never from thence to part
The months roll on, & quiet joy
The mother's eyes express
What like the fond & duteous child
Can make a mother blest?

She knew the insidious dire disease
Its [deletion]A[/deletion] fatal progress kept
Yet calmly saw the foe advance,
And smiled though Owen wept.
She needed not a daughter's love
With softest, kindest care,
To [deletion][/deletion] [insertion]ease her suffering[/insertion], dress the bed,
And the repast prepare.
With sleepless eye through the long night
To watch - with gentlest tone
unwearied soothe the dreary hours
When every hope was flown
These cares were Owen's - his fond heart
His willing hand obeys;
and Heaven beholds the deed of love
and Heaven the deed repays.
[deletion]By Innocence & Peace her life[/deletion]
[deletion]Of trial has been blest[/deletion]
[deletion]And the last earthly wish obtain'd[/deletion]
[deletion]She dies on Owen's breast[/deletion]
He sees his mother's mortal pains
And grief his bosom wrings
But Conscience to his bleeding heart
Her consolation brings
And she, (by innocence & peace
Her life of trial blest
And her last earthly wish obtain'd.)
Expires on Owen's breast
