My dear Elizabeth -. I am much obliged to
thee for thy long letter & [insertion]now[/insertion] set out as thou desired
to visit the neighbours I may go
first to Free Park & tell that J Thomas is
very poorly with a severe cough which however
she thinks has given way to some medicine
of [unclear]Dr[/unclear] Doyle, John & the children are all well
Bess Park is Bess Park still & not likely
to be any thing else in haste we next call
at [unclear]Boakefield[/unclear] where we went to see Tom
by himself to subscribe to a fund for rewarding
constant attendance at school. we go down
to his storeroom near the stable where
he writes his name with a pencil & subscribes
[unclear]4 pc[/unclear] week, we now pay our respects to
Hannah to sympathise with her headache
& ask for Tommy who is very well still
sleeping with Mich & Sally how happy!!!
Hannah thinks herself bilious says she took
a vomitting fit which lasted 3 hours &
which she supposes carried away bile she
expects to be tolerably well [insertion]for a few days[/insertion] till [deletion]this[unclear][/unclear][/deletion] ?[/unclear][/deletion]
it collects again - [deletion]in a a[/deletion] Mary White very
well nursing a fine fat lump of a child
Sally well Matty going to Carlow to pay
Eliza Birkett a visit My aunt Chandlee
greatly revived I spent this evening
with her & wishing to go backwards I
went down stairs & open'd the back
door wondering when I got half out that
there should be so high a step which however
I mounted & suddenly found my foot up
to the ancle in a tub of water -
Abby is rather better tho' still very poorly
Thomas & Fanny Bewley well Lucy as lovely
as ever & S Beale as cosey George came
in to day & made pens for us I next
come to Wm Leadbeater's concerns
thou sees I am too high for the [underline]Lowes order [/underline]
therefore pass them by. At WL's I find
Sally Shackleton recovering from an attack
of Erysipelas on her face. Mary Leadbeater
binding books on M Haughton's oake table
WL looking on & occasionally reading
Ms De StaÃ«l [deletion]which[/deletion] who delights us all
the account
the account of her father tho' far more [unclear]ininate[/unclear],
agrees with [unclear]Marmostel's[/unclear] Lydia
I find is not at home but M Shackleton
is paying her aunt a short visit reading to
her whenever opportunity offers but they are
so often interrupted with calls to the Post office
[unclear][/unclear] women coming with their [unclear][/unclear] to
[unclear][/unclear] mix'd up to cure them. Sarah is busy
making little boxes &c &c [insertion]so[/insertion] that her mother
does not like to disturb her, knowing that
the paste might dry in the interim & that
in consequence the young woman who is
only in her 22nd year might lose her temper
Molly always indulged her children too much
she ought to keep up her consequences & then

would be respected more by them there is
nothing like keeping a tight hand over
young people "But hark a long lost voice
young people, "But hark a long lost voice
I hear - Like distant music soft & clear"
