I have been thinking, my beloved sister, that I
should write thee a few lines soon again, after the
impatient kind of a letter I last wrote thee: - since
which I got thine, which upbraided me, for indeed
it seemed to me to come from the resigned heart
of an obedient true born child: - thou had not
received mine when thou wrote I believe: - & I
hope it did not add much to thy grief. Cousin
Robt. Grubb was at our Quarly. meeting, will perhaps
tell thee about it. To my astonishment (after more
than 2 months silence, & suffering which I never before
had experienced,) I did as I did, & tho'
[unclear][/unclear] feared afterwards that I had done
ply feared afterwards that I had done
wrong, yet quietness & peace have been near
since my return, & a more resigned will than I
feared I ever should have felt: - it is indeed because
unmerrited mercy faileth not, that some of
us are spared. I thought to write more but
hear cousin RG is going.
Farewell S: S
