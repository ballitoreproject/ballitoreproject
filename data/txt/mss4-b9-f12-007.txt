Richmond 28 July 1828
My dear Sarah,
Yesterday evening about 1/2 past
five o'clock an event occurred here in which you
are somewhat interested - a nephew of yours uttered
his first cry - a stout chap of some pounds weight
that looks as if he was a month old - and seems
to consider his introduction into this new world as
a matter of course, he is so much at his ease among
strangers - Lydia is finely this morning & in good
spirits after a nights rest & I hope will soon be as
alert as her son - We mean to salute him by the
name of William with whatever addenda is hereafter
approved of - The visiting was all over & Thomas &
his friend Erasmus had departed before this last visitor
arrived - so we are free to pay him every attention -
Hannah Harvey is to be in Dublin the day after
tomorrow - Wednesday - I hope you will not again
miss seeing her - she will remain about a week -
Hannah is anxious to see you but could not accomplish
a walk to Gt Britain St - Give my love to Edwd
& tell him [deletion]a[/deletion] I sent him the leases yesterday week
& wrote by post at same time - let me know
when you write whether he received them & whether
Parker has signed them - our dear love to yourself
& Deborah - Is not she with you? Did we tell you
we received the ware safe & thankee for your trouble
& we will soon pay our debts I hope - It was pleasant
all this business here took place on a Sunday so that

I could be at home - It was well it was not while
we had four strangers in the house - Lydia had no
attendant save Doctor & Nurse of greater experience
than Sally & Charlotte Dawson - Sally's spirits fell
almost to [underline]zero[/underline] but now she is as gay as a lark
There's a letter for you I assure you I did not
mean to write half so much when I sat down
you must pardon my loquacity -
Your most affectionte
J.J. Fisher
My dear Sarah -
I put my hand to confirm the
good account James has given thee of our
[unclear]stranger[/unclear] nephew and his mother - I think
I never saw Lydia so well after the birth
of a child but with all our boasting, I
do not expect she will [underline]out[/underline] [underline]riding[/underline] [underline]the[/underline] 3rd
[underline]day[/underline] - I hope thou & Edward will be
with us this autumn & see & enjoy
our happiness - I intend writing to thee
in a few days again. Lydia was
not more than one hour [unclear]much[/unclear]ile -
she had been complaining since the day
before - The boy is, & [unclear]was[/unclear] since as large
as Jozy was at his age - he [deletion]has[/deletion] [insertion]is[/insertion] broad faced
& with eyes of dark blue. This [unclear][/unclear]
[unclear][/unclear] past time so adieu - Love to Edward
Thine most affectly [unclear]JF[/unclear]
