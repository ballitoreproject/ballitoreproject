Ballitore 7th of 3d mo 1807
My dear Elizabeth - I fully intended to have written to thee from
Mountmelick but having no one to take a letter I was obliged to wait till
now. I recd thine in Streadbally & Mary Pike read it, & one from aunt G to aunt
S to us in the chaise I was put beyond the task by [underline]wine[/underline] alas hard fallen
how changed! I who was but a day or two before the pink of perfection in
Mountmelick so learn'd so sensible so wise, but what cannot human
nature fall to! I was quite too great a Philosopher for the company
of young friends especially the Goodbodys who carefully avoided having
much to do with me I was frequently ask'd did I not make verses
write much, learn Latin, take views, &c &c &c nothing seem'd too
difficult for so powerful a genius, amongst the rest I was so
great a wit that Jane Goodbody was afraid to speak before me, I will
now lay by the subject of self hoping I have raised a [deletion]a[/deletion] due share of
esteem in thy mind, I saw poor Jane Le Batte who is getting
above water & looks pretty well, S Russell told me that M A & her
family were all well Joseph Harvey brought Bess Deaves to the meeting
she intends spending a while at Z Pims & if possible coming to Ballitore
before she goes home she is but delicate tho' I suppose as well
as usual, Mary Pike intends going to Clonmel I dont wonder she should
be a favorite of thine as well as of every one who knows her I think she is
most excellent I saw Jane Bewley & Huldah both sound & good also
My aunt & I drank tea with M Bewley on sixth day evening in the cottage
which she was to leave the next [deletion]f[/deletion] morning for the large house op[insertion]p[/insertion]osite
Mungo & James were along with us the latter still endeavouring
for Betsy, how admirable is his conduct we only saw Hannah for
a few minutes & were glad to have so much of MB's company in quiet

more than 2/6 but is anxious that all the profit arising therefrom
may be thine so prefers dealing with thee, he desires his love.
A Shannon was enquiring for thee her school is pretty full
Susanna as usual neat & elegant I took care not to offend her this
time, so kept at a civil distance. Mary Gatchell look'd pretty

the seat & mean to bring out a chair when ever I want to sit there
