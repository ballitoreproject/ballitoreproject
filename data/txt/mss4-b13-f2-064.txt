there Joseph Nicholson & John Hancock, who had got horses,
neither of them being well: we had the satisfaction of their
company till bed-time, & again in the morning to breakfast

We rode, sto[insertion]p[/insertion]ping on the way to refresh man & beast
18 miles to Ramsey to dinner, & had a meeting appointed
same evening there at 6 o'clock: to which went, it was
very large, but to poor me, I think from begining to end

Isaac, left Ramsey, & our agreeable hostess at the inn, with
whom I was much taken, as also with her little daughter
Mary, her name Margt. Gleister. Got to Kirkmichael to
dine
