Jacob is pretty well. poor Jo Jacob indends [sic] for Ingland [sic] in a few days I have good ground to hope that he and his dear wife is growing in the root of religion and may truly ^say^ they are a sweet cople [sic] being tender young plants. and some times are comforted in their compney [sic]. thre [sic] are also some more in this city thats on the way to haven [sic]. and I belive [sic] is much conserned [sic] for the one good love [?] which is so far well if they hould [sic] on and not let the bewiching [sic] surfeting [sic] cears [sic] of the vain world overset the work. wich [sic] has been the case with some bright sons of the morning  ye in this oure [?] day well may thou dear one [paper folded] on thy way am sure its my desire for thee and thin [sic] as for my self that lives in peace  I intend to let them hear from me by some friend that atends [sic] the meeting as I dont know whether I shall get or not
