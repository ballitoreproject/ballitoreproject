Waterford 13th of 11th mo: 1818
My dear aunt
I need not repeat how
very acceptable thy letter was - it
gratified several besides myself
I spent this evening most agreeably
with Mary Watson for whom it
was read & who desires me to say
that tho' her name was not mentioned
she is assured that thou loves
her, that she is always glad to
hear of thee & that this letter from
thy own hand was cheering to
her & adds dear love to my mother
aunts C. & Lydia, Betsy & thyself.
She shewed me a letter from Dykes
Alexander's wife who says a letter
from S. Grellett from Stockholm
dated 8th mo: brings a favourable
account of his & Wm. Allen's procedure -
that they have met with
the "scattered seed" & tho' many times
impoverished in spirit & outwardly

tried, have been convinced that their
movements are right - at one place
they had two meetings, at the first 50
attended at the second 200, tho' [underline]no notice[/underline]
had been given & many more would
have gone had there been room -
Hannah Alexander also says she had
a letter from R. Cockin Doncaster
(married to my aunt's cousin Ellen
Abrahams) who tells of Elizth Frey
having a meeting at Lord Darby's
(where she lodged) at which were 100
people when Truth was so brought
into dominion that all were melted
into tears & when Lord Darby took
leave of her he burst into tears &
was unable to speak - her brother
Joseph John Gurney is with her.
This reminded me of the meetings
of which we read in former days,
Mary Naftal returned with S. Grellett
I wish I could have related the above
more satisfactorily - we hear that
Daniel Starbuck of Milford was
killed by the fall of a board
which struck him on the
head & he survived but a few minutes.
I have scribbled this
after I came up to bed & my pen
is very bad - My dear love is to
my aunt & Jane C. all at the Mill
Fuller's Court, EB. James & Mary,
M & A. D. - I hope Ellen Glaizbrook
has lost the pain in her side
& is able to nurse. Love to
Margaret & Jane Williams, Wilkie
& family & tho last not least
my own trusty friend G. B.
Farewell afftely tho' hastily
Thy ELeadbeater
