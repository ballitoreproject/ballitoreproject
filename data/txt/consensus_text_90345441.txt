Willie who complains poor fellow of
not having heard from home for
about four months and wonders
what can be the cause of such
a long and unusual silence.
What the cause can be I know
not, but this I know, that
I believe four of us wrote to him
already this year, and do hope he
has since received our letters.
Perhaps the ill fated Pacific was the
bearer of some. It is pleasant
to hear he [deletion]I[/deletion] is well and his little
family so too. The Winter had
been unusually severe [deletion]and[/deletion] the river
frozen and business consequently at
a standstill. In June he expected
there would be quite a rush [deletion]of[/deletion] [insertion]in[/insertion]
the trade. Margt had a long
letter from Jane Procter about Liddy &c
&c - she mentioned her having a
little cold which I hope wont
signify - but cannot help feeling
anxious about her.
