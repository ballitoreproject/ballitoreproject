My dear friend,


        My son was favoured with a letter from thee not long ago, in which thou desired me to write to thee. My memory being often deficient, and not knowing but I might have been in thy debt in that way, I examined, & believe I wrote last. However, as I love to converse with thee, & would be glad to contribute to thy gratification, I freely & willingly & cordially salute thee after this manner  & not only thee but thy dear sister H  whom I am glad to be more intimately acquainted with, glad to feel as a friend that is near my heart. ^[pencil note] X^ I wish you ^thee & thy dear sister^ not only pleasure, but profit in one anothers society, & the way to witness this is (I believe ye well know) while conversing together to feel after the inward and spiritual life, if happily it may arise & season & sanctify your communication. Like the two disciples, who were going to Emmaus, communing on the way and sad, to whose company Jesus joined himself, opened the book of revelation, informed their understanding, tarried with them, blessed and brake break, & gave to them. May this be your experience my dear friends!  And I am persuaded ye are both peculiar objects of merciful regard & heavenly notice, & believe that as ye resign yourselves in all humility and devotedness of spirit, to do & to suffer the Lords will respecting you, that his good [page number] 130 presence will continue to accompany you in heights & in depths, in present & future dispensations, as it has in the past; preparing & fitting & qualifying you more & more, ^&^ strengthening & enabling you to go down to the very bottom, & as it were to explore & fathom the depths of Satan  & from thence to arise in clearness & brightness, as the disciples & servants of him, who descended first into the lower parts of the earth, & afterwards ascended in dominion & glory
