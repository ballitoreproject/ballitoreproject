My Dear Friend
R. Shacklton [sic]


        In a degree of I hope sensable [sic] gratitude do I know attempt to acknowledge the favor of thy valued Epistle which came to hand in a drooping season both of Body and Mind and thy Affectionate Instructive lines was permitted to convey somthing [sic] like a cordial to my spirrit [sic]  I much wish these unmerited privilidges [sic] may be received by me with proper humiliation whilst mixt with sweet Consolation 
        The rememberence [sic] of my Beloved Friends in Ballitore is very agreeable and the many comfortable hours that I have spent at the Retreat is frequent [sic] subject of pleasing reflection   my late affliction have [sic] as thou beautyfully [sic] remarkt  shook me to the very foundation my Health have suffered considerabley [sic] I beleive [sic] from the anxiety of my Mind insomuch that my recovery for some time appeared very doubtfull [sic]  but may thankfully acknowledge that my Mind was generaly [sic] preserved quiet and was at seasons favored to feel a degree of I hope true Resignation my Health seems measureabley [sic] amended and find myself gathering strenth [sic] as fast as might be expected considering that I have ^frequent^ returns of the complaint  if my time here should be le^a^nthened [sic] out a little longer  that it may be spent with redoubled dilligence [sic] is the desire of my heart
        last week this Meeting was visited by our Dear Friends R. Valintine [sic] J. Hall and J. Couron [?] ~ in which I hope they were enabled to discharge themselves faithfully they was so kind as to pay even me two visits a favor which I was affraid [sic] to ask or hope for  the remembering of their Company will not I think be easyly [sic] eraced [sic] from my Mind  how like an Hounourable [sic] Father is R. V so willing to incourage [sic] and cherish even the least appearence [sic] of good in any way   they left this City for Cork and expected to attend our Provence [sic] Meeting which is to be held there    I wish I could convey my Dear love to thy Wife as fully as its felt by me  can truly say I feel a loss in the want of her Conversation  alas there is few Mothers in this place what if I say they are unknown to me if any  Becky and Mary Mark seem the only two sisters with whom I can associate freely  except Susy Barnes whose afflictions have endeared her very much to me ~ but I am ^not^ disatisfyd [sic] as to myself only cannot help wishing for the sake of my Dear Friends that they might be brought more closely into that Love and Unity in which there would be near fellowship
        am ready to wonder at the freedom in which I have addresst [sic] my Dear Friend R.SI hope thou ^wilt^ excuse me for the weakness of my Abilitys [sic] is indeed present with me but am not fond of filling my Letters up with needless Apoligys [sic]  thou knows me and therefore will not expect much from me ~ the low estate of things in this place would not have mentioned only that I believe thou art sensable [sic] of it  would be sorry to expose the weakness of my Friends improperly  and if I have done so in this ^perticular [sic]^ thou would oblidge [sic] me by correcting me for it  as I hope shall always esteem the reproof of a Friend as a Mark of their Love   please to present my Love affectionably [sic] to Dear A and L Shackleton am indebted to the former for two acceptable Epistles which intend answering soon  but at present cannot bear to write much at a time I wish Molly and Sally to know that I dearly love ^them^ ~ and that the rememberence [sic] of my Friends is a matter to which I cannot be Indifferent  my love kindly salutes J. Haughtons Family  believe ^me^ to remain
        with Affection thy Oblidged

my Dear love awaits Debby Chandlee  my Mother wishes to be presented in kind rememberence [sic]  we live together and Limerick seems to me likely to be the most suitable place of residence
