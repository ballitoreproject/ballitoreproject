R. S. To his Father
					Dublin 30th of Fourthmonth 1771.
				My Dear Father,
					I was favoured with thine of the 28th Current—and in hopes it may afford some entertainment, would give thee a further detail of our meeting, if I could remember it; but as one billow succeeds another, so one exercising opportunity follows so closely upon another in my deep wadings and weary steppings along, that I cannot always retain particulars in my remembrance. The meetings have been uncommonly large and crowded. It has been almost wholly the lot of our friend S. F. to burn incense publicly. He is, indeed, carried on wonderfully. His Master dignifies him, and exalts his testimony through him: he is made like the shew-bread on the altar—some sacred symbol that is eminent, conspicuous, attended with a degree of glory, in order to attract and engage a people too much outward, and, if possible by instrumental means, enamour them with the beauty which is in the Truth. Such is the mercy and condescension of the Creator, who uses various means, in wisdom, that his creatures may not perish for ever; andleaves all without excuse, that their perdition may be of   themselves. The London queries were read and answered yesterday, in the meeting of conference of Friends of both sexes. Samuel was beautifully drawn forth upon this occasion, as usual, The public-meeting to-day was very large, and Samuel was concerned in testimony, also feelingly and fervently in supplication. I thought the meeting for discipline in the afternoon yesterday was flat, this afternoon more lively. I have had pretty-close employment upon committees, &c. so that, at home or abroad, there seems little rest to the sole of my foot. Neither is it in oil that I dip it when it does rest; but if it returns to the ark of the testimony, & sinks or swims along with it, I may be satisfied.
				I am, Dear Father,
					Thy affectionate, dutiful son
						R. S.
