My dear Aunt Sally,
Thou sent to know if I would
chuse thee to write to me? certainly, & for two
reasons thy letters would be most welcome, the
one, because they come from thee, & the other
from Ballitore. I hear thou art with
Mary Bostello, it is a bad time for me to write,
for my letter cannot recompense for taking
from such elegant & agreeable company
but thou has always very good company,
but thou has not always Mary Costello, I
would be obliged to thee to remember me to her.
I suppose thou often sees my dear Lydia, alas
Besty's foreboding fears were but too well founded
least, no worse. Governess had not time to look
how are thy eyes & head? I hope they are, at
for the verse thou sent for, but I intend to
send it the next time. I am sorry I have

not thy habit shirts ready to send, but I hope
they will be time enough at the Quarterly
Meeting, I have stinted myself to half a
sheet, or rather my time has, but I hope
thou will make up the deficiency,
With love to all with thee, I remain thy
I have since got the verse, which I inclose
affectionate niece D Leadbeater.
