Dungar: 13/3 month 1779

Dear friend,

	++ I am here here on an excursion with Jacob Gough, Joseph Williams, Elizabeth Pike, Sarah Newland, Jane Watson & my wife, by appointment of our Quarterly Meeting, paying a visit to divers meetings belonging to the monthly meeting of Mt. melick ++ I am as it were only putting on my armour for the service, so cannot yet boast to theebut I own to thee, my dear friend, I love & like the service of the Master, if he would be pleased in any little degree to fit & prepare take into his service. The prospect of this renewed labour & pains taken being effectual, to my thoughts seems dullfor though for the present the thing crooked, be, by the laying on of hands made straight, when it is let go, it often returns to its old accustomed direction. And yet there is such a heart-felt satisfaction in the Lords service, it is so excellent, & so dignifies & enobles the faculties, that for my part I would prefer the lowest office in his house to the highest employment of this worldAnd these sentiments, I am persuaded, are thine.
	Thou hast (doubtless) heard that my son has obtained the object of his constant love, his beloved Lydiaon the 23rd ultimate they took each other in marriage in Meath-street. The God of my Fathers was graciously pleased to be near, & to crown the solemnity with his bowing, heart-tendering power & presence. And I was entirely satisfied that the connexion was of him, & owned by himThis, my dear friend, I look upon as a capital favour, as the disposing of my children in this manner is a matter which comes very close to my heart, & I cannot be satisfied without a clear evidence that the thing is right. My wife & daughters & I have thus made good our Retreat to our pleasant, tranquil dwelling, & hope we may without presumption, say in humble gratitude say, Deus nobis hoc otia fecit. +++ I am, dear Joseph,
		thy affectionate friend & kinsman
