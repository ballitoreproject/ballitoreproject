Dear Mary
Dublin
21st: 8 mo - 1776
Notwithstanding my hurry, I have
endeavoured once more to address my dr. frd.,
for whom I have, & I hope ever shall the greatest
esteem; tho indeed at this time I find myself
self void of abilitys, to perform a wish to entertain
thee or to express the grefull sensations
of a heart, truely sincere & indeed my spirit
is exceedingly low, tho, I can't complain
in general, as I have been enabled to keep
them up pretty well, soon very soon my dr.
Molly, am I to change my present state, &
situation & oh! may it be a pleasing exchange
which will open to me scenes of joy, & satisfaction;
this morning I am going to present
my Marriage, for the last time, hoping I
will command a becoming resolution, to go
thro so waighty an affair with propriety;
and sixth day is appointed for to conclude
the whole, so that my dr. some day next week
I suppose we shall all leave town, my sister
Hannah, is to go with me & stay a few weeks

at her return sister Fanny, is to succeed her
I also expect my Brothers, will come one part of
the way & the other all: I suppose I shant be likely
to settle for a few weeks, as the house is not
quite ready, therefore we are to abide at Toms
Fathers during that space; our Wedding is to be
rather larger, than I would chuse, however cant
well be avoided theres so many relations, the
Company will consist of about thirty. -
The thoughts of parting all my friend, has [deletion]caus'd[/deletion]
[deletion]me[/deletion][insertion]serv'd[/insertion] at seasons to afflict me very much, yet as my
trust is in him who I hope has been my directe[unclear]r[/unclear]
to that which will tend to my lasting, & everlasting
happiness; which may ever be before my
view, I shall be supported to get over all these things
that seems to hang over me with heaviness, thee will
be pleas'd to excuse the incorrectness of this, as realy
I am so incapable to proceed, that I have not a
mind to send this: however its only to shew thee
I am sincerely thine, & that nothing is able to separate
our lasting friendship, & in order to make
in some degree, a return for thy kindness for
whom indeed I am much indepted. - I suppose
Sally Hall, is to be married soon, I wish her
a great deal of happiness, no doubt but she
will be very sorry to part you, as you will

to part with her, - so i think Peggy is gone
home, well my wishes is many for her welfair;
I hope she is likely to be setled comfortably;
now - I must unavoidably close; n- news [deletion]won't[/deletion]
stiring worth communicating, nor am I at this
time disposed to serch for any, so fair well
my dr; my amiable Girl, & except these few
lines, from one who still subscribes herself
thy truely real & Disinterested friend & corrisp.
