Tent Lodge July 16 — 12
The health sent me to Bath last Jany., & there
my dear Friend I received your first letter - your last, was
sent to me during a visit at some distance from hence, & this
is the first leisure opportunity I have had of acknowledging the
rect. of both your kind letters — I assure you it is painful
to me to refuse any request you can make me, but since
the accident by which my head was fractured, I have
been totally incapable of attending to any thing that required
the least application — & to give a plan for a
House is not so easily done, as those who never try'd would
imagine — besides, I should not venture at anytime, unless
I could view the situation &c &c, for I should probably
be guilty of some egregious blunder, which the owner might
regret as long as he lived. — Being aware of my own incapability

I have not at all consider'd the enclosed plan, but seeing
it is nearly of a triangular form; (if there was no objection
from its situation) I should be inclined to place the House
in this manner -
Garden
&c.
House

I am extremely glad to hear that the Cottage dialogues are
printed in a cheap way, without Notes, for when your Peasantry
can read, nothing ever written was better calculated to
improve them — Every person to whom I have lent the Book
agree with me in opinion — When you publish your
Dialogues between those of higher rank, pray inform me of
the title, that I may lose no time in reading them — I should
hope the Cottage dialogues proved a lucrative publication, for
they are very popular in England, & have had the rare fate of
being commended by all the Reviewers who have noticed them —
I am not one of those who take the Reviewers for my Standard
in judging of a Work, for though my critical knowledge must be
Bush [unclear][/unclear]

very inferior to theirs, yet whilst I live I must judge for myself
what pleases me — I am rejoiced to learn that all is flourishing
at Ballitore, — long may my kind Friends there, possess health,
Spirits, & ease! — these, I think sufficient to satisfy rational
Beings, all beyond is Imaginary — We seem in this Island
to have changed dispositions with yours, — you are [underline]apparently[/underline]
quiet, whilst we are turbulent,— & to confess the truth I expect
[unclear][/unclear] long both will burst forth to the destination of [unclear][/unclear] &
I [unclear][/unclear] — May God avert the mischief I [unclear]apprehend[/unclear]
[unclear]The[/unclear] Major is absent on the Recruiting Service, the complaint
in his throat is not materially worse, tho' certainly no better —
Jn: is on a visit to her Sister at Edinburgh — faithful Turpin
is still with me, & always begs to be properly remember'd to
you & the Doyles — I have not seen or heard of Thos. Wilkinson
some time, but I expect a visit from him in the course of
the Summer — Do you know anything of a Widow Buxton,
formerly living (I believe) in Dublin, now Married to a W. Hemming
of Weymouth - She was, a Member of your Society, & I believe
still is an odd sort of one, — She has an amiable [unclear]Danl.[/unclear] who is I think
a Preacher in your Society - tell me all you know about this family — & also

what you know of a family of the name of Darrah formerly
living at Eagle Hill — Farewell! Remember me very kindly to all
who still think of me, & believe me Yrs. very Sincerely

I conclude, my dear Friend, that I must be
letter indebted to you, because Thomas Wilkinson tells me
you expect to hear from me, — but I have been searching in
[unclear]vain[/unclear]for your letter — At any rate, my best acknowledgments
[unclear]are[/unclear] due to you, for the excellent little Work, you so kindly sent
[unclear]me[/unclear], & as I hope in a day or two to see the Bishop of Landaff,
I will not longer delay to return my thanks — I think the Land[unclear][/unclear]
[unclear][/unclear] Dialogues calculated to do essential service in Ireland, &
[unclear][/unclear] every Landholder in that Kingdom possess'd one — a [unclear]similar[/unclear]
[unclear][/unclear] work would be equally desirable in England, provided it was
[unclear]de[/unclear]scriptive of the failings of English peasantry — those you [unclear]enquire[/unclear]
[unclear][/unclear]te are almost peculiar to the Irish — Go on, my excellent Friend,
[unclear][/unclear] Poor will bless you, the Rich will be indebted you, & both will be
[unclear]rofitted[/unclear]! If I recollect right, your last letter gave me good
 [unclear]accounts[/unclear]of yourself, & family, & [insertion]of[/insertion] all those, I shall ever remember
unclear]with[/unclear] kindness at Ballitore; This, has been a severe Winter, but
hope has produced no illness to my Friends there — I know
[unclear][/unclear] will be desirous of hearing how all goes on with me, but I

seem fated to be a gloomy Correspondent — Sickness, & its
attendant Sorrow, has for some time made havoc in my heart, -
my beloved Bedford has been for the last sixteen months in
a decline, & I am prepared to expect every post will bring the
tidings of his dissolution. — he has ever been inexpressibly
dear to me, & it has cost me much exertion to reconcile
myself to this expectation, — I bless God, I [underline]think[/underline] I can now
bear the blow with fortitude, & humble resignation — I am
taught to sit very loose to Earth, & to be thankful that increasing
years, must necessarily shorten my abode on it.
I have not seen our friend [deletion]of[/deletion] Thomas the last half year, but
I hope the next Quarterly meeting may bring him here - he is
an excellently good hearted Being, exerting himself hourly
in the welfare of his fellow creature - He has of a late been
very forward in promoting a Bible Society in his Neighbourhood,
I hope you are all advocates for the establishment of such Societies, -
they seem to me calculated to promote peace, & goodwill,
on Earth, & eternal happiness in Heaven. How strange it is,
that there should be opposers to these institutions. & yet there
are, amongst many whom we believe to be truly pious good
Christians,— this, proves how differently we read this sacred Book,

& should teach us forbearance towards each other, for what Sect
dares to claim Infallibility! I hear your friend Miss Edgeworth
continues publishing the effusions of her never-resting pen; I
have not seen her last work, but one of her admirers tells me
it is the first of her writing, my Correspondent ever thought too long.
Have you read Lord Byron's publications? he has as strong
a Genius, as he has a strangely ill regulated Mind; The Corsair
I have not yet got, I hear it excels all his former poems; there are
parts of the Giaour I am sure would delight you — The Major is
with his Regiment at Durham, where he receives the most gratifying
attentions from the descendants of his old Neighbours —
Julet, & faithful Turpin are with me; & so I hope will Mrs. Allan
in the course of this month — Charles is still in Spain;
greatly distinguished himself at the siege of Dr. Sebastians -
which occasion he was promoted to the rank of Lt. Colonel in
the Engineers — I grieve to add, that my eldest Son & his Wife are
again separated, & a Suit is pending in Doctor's Commons, which
I expect will be determined next Month — I have no sort of intercourse
with [underline]either[/underline], but am painfully anxious for both —
Pray remember me very kindly to all my Friends at Ballitore,
& believe me with great regard very Sincerely Yr.
