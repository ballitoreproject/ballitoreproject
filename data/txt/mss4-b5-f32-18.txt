Annes Mills 8th of 3rd mo 1899
My dear friend,
I am indebted to thee for one or more
acceptable epistles. The little parcel I had sent the day
after we arrived is to our very obliging friend [unclear]Fitzsimmons[/unclear]
I hope thou get it safely - my dear Aunt M. Grubb
was a [unclear]such[/unclear] comfortably with us - we always
enjoy her society but particularly so when she is
tolerably well in health which [insertion]is[/insertion] [deletion]was[/deletion] happily the case[insertion] just now[/insertion]
Roberts little children spent a day here with her.
Their parents are expected this week from Dublin.
we are looking out for cousin M. L [unclear]Go[/unclear]- hearing that
they purposed leaving Cork yesterday. What a lovely
Meeting is [unclear]Hilconnor[/unclear]! - we have been feasted with English
letters. it is reported that Ann Braithwaite & many other
friends intend to favour our yearly Meetings with their
company - as thou art interested in the welfare of schools
I shall give thee an extract from Lucy Bradshaw's letter to
Sarah relative to poor Joseph Lancasters original school
on the Beraugh road. she says "There has lately been a
most interesting examination of the children. Joseph Butterworth
in the chair - they performed most admirably & I
believe quite to the astonishment of many present. Their
teachers examined them first upon the part of Scripture
they had been reading & then the Chairman requested
any person present would ask them any question
they pleased, he turned to a Clergyman & begged he

he would be kind enough [insertion]to examine[/insertion] them — this he did in a
very judicious manner. & They not only gave the
answer to every question that admitted of it in the Scripture
language - but explained the meaning of some
of them in a clear & concise manner. They have a remarkable
knowledge of the connection between the
old & new testament and can repeat many of the
prophecies in the formes & their fulfillment in the
letter without missing a word — they read with
practiced correctness & gave great satisfaction in
the other branches of their learning. the boys worked
a sum of 8 figures by 3 in their quarters of arithmetic -
Rowland Hill, Joseph Butterworth & William Allen
spoke in an instructive manner particularly the latter
& 8 Madagascar boys were brought forward who had
only been six months in the school & who really read
tolerably" William & Rebecca Byrd are performing
a family visit to the members of Peel meeting. They
completed a similar engagement in Southwark
& have had several Publick meetings acceptably
John & Sarah Grubb are about to enter a [insertion]a like arduous [/insertion] [deletion]similar[/deletion]
engagement. but in a more extensive manner
a letter from dear Nathan Hunt [insertion]he[/insertion] writes of the comfort
he felt in being restored & the bosom of his dear
family & finding his beloved wife much better
than she had been. she had been out several times
with him & he hopes her health will be better than it has

been for some years - he feels much peace in the
retrospect of the past - & experiences in a lively manner
his gratitude for the help afforded him - -
We have also heard of the comfortable accomplishment
of Mary Allen's marriage with
Cornelius Hanbury. The meeting was very much
crouded - - I am about to request a copy of little
poem written by them an answered by thy. E.
an a rou. which dear Joseph R. had given thee
my sister Richardson is much interested
the Ballitore memoirs. I hope we may see
them.. I am working & have our Barclay
amongst the pupil of James Whites - but his
father is very loath to part him under the
present awful prospects of disturbances - what
a [unclear]stole[/unclear] the inhabitants of our neighbouring counties
are in!. I often think of thee & thy household
dear declining Anne Doyle to whom with her kind
sister I should like to be affectionately remembered
to my dear old acquaintance Sarah Shackleton..
Thy sister Lydia & her's - poor Abby &
Becky - - My Mother enjoys good health
with which we are all indulged at present
I am my dear friends sincerely attached
