Dublin 22nd July 1828
My dear Elizabeth
The thatcher was to get 3 £ if
he performed a certain quantity of work, it is
likely he has done that, but as I cannot well
describe to you or Eben how much that is or
was, he might be paid 2 £..10s-0d leaving the
balance till I try if I can get down once more
If Eben will pay that for me I will thank
him. If you approve of Jno Byrne as a
tenant in the room of William, please to
agree with him, I suppose he can commence
rent from the time William stops
Your Leases as well as Lydias remain in status quo
as we have not yet procured the Packers signatures.
They cannot now go by Dr Fisher but
when opportunities will doubtless soon occur. [unclear]Ardells[/unclear]
say you may be satisfied that the Subletting Act
will not apply to your lease. I have got the
Amt of Jno Doyles order £2.. 4s. 0d and placed it
to your credit. I have had a letter from James
Timmins the Painter about the painting of the houses
offering to do them for 3 guineas. Would you have
the kindness to make an agreement with him

for doing what painting they may require
he said he would also put in [insertion]new,[/insertion] what broken
panes of glass were in the windows. Make a
bargain with him like a good girl for us.
The doors to be green, the window sashes black
the shutters oak colour the rest as you
think but yourself. I suppose if this job
were done that we might set them. Thos
Glazebrook promised to get the floors made
for us, [deletion]if[/deletion] has he done anything toward
improving the front of [unclear]his new holding[/unclear].
McManus has not fulfilled his promise
the rent being still unpaid.
Debh & Sarah set out for the [unclear]Largery[/unclear] in
Bray this morning so that I am
alone once more. I suppose there
is only a chance of seeing Eben here
I wish he would make a day or two
adieu & believe me
Your affectionate
E B
