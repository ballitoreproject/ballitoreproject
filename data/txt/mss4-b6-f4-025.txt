I have heard no particulars [unclear]since[/unclear] then of M.B.'s
settlement, but doubtless his death must have been a
very serious loss to it, & to the state also.. He had
rendered himself conspicuous the preceding year
by his determined opposition to the introduction of
Slavery into his adopted State (Illinois) which was
attempted by a Party in the Legislature, but the
cause of Justice & Humanity triumphed, & owed no
little, it is said, to his able pen. It was to be
regretted that he chose such a distant spot, & one
so completely in the woods, for his abode, because
it never repaid him for his time & money, & it
laboured under many local disadvantages which,
in other States, he need not have encountered.
Robert Owen told [insertion]me,[/insertion] when he was narrating his death,
that he believed, had M. Birkbeck lived, he would
have joined his community at Harmony, & he would
have considered him as a very efficient member,
from his known talents & experience. I suppose
thou art aware that one of M.B.'s daughters was
married some years ago to a "Ballitore boy" - a school-fellow
fellow of mine - Hanks, who settled with his Father
in-law, & I believe remains there still. Hanks'
father, I understand, had a difference with M.B.
& has been living in Pennsylvania for some years
past. - R. Owen went to England in July
& returned in November - he landed here & I
saw a good deal of him whilst he was in the
City. His voyage had, if possible, increased his
Zeal for the promotion of the "New system", & it
seemed as if argument were entirely thrown away on him.

He visited a [unclear][/unclear] in New York & gave one
public lecture at which he exhibited a model of the
buildings for one of his intended communities. The
audience was large & highly respectable, but his
sentiments were in such direct opposition to theirs
upon almost every subject, he was more laughed
at than admired, & I heard of [underline]no[/underline] converts afterwards.
I dined in his company one day with a large party
where he was closely questioned as to his religious
opinions, & where he was exceedingly frank in
avowing his infidelity.- He told us that he considered
the Bible to be a collection of silly fables which could
be of no use to any one - the doctrine of rewards &
punishments as ridiculous & irrational - the idea of
a superintending Providence, as a contradiction to
all experience - & a belief in the immortality of the
Soul, [insertion]as[/insertion] a mere chimera of the imagination! The
only subject which he deems worthy the attention of
man, is, the "doctrine of the science of circumstances"
and he says that when it becomes understood, every
body will be perfectly good & happy, & all the
results of the fanciful Millenium, will inevitably
be produced on earth! I told him that, for the
sake of argument, admitting this to be true, yet I
thought, [underline]after[/underline] a person had passed the meridian of
life & being aware that he must die, the very
idea of utter extinction afterwards, & the consequent
deprivation of all this temporal happiness, would of
itself render him miserable - he has no heaven to
look to - no hope beyond the grave! "Why" said he
in reply "I answer your objections by quoting my
"own case - I am now 55 years of age - I have long
"held those opinions - I have expended upwards of

"fifty thousand pounds in [unclear]promoting[/unclear] them, one penny
"of which I do not regret, and yet I would not exchange
"[underline]my[/underline] happiness for that of any person who has preceded
"me or who now is in existence"! With such an
Enthusiast, I saw it was in vain to argue, & I merely
smiled at his flights of imagination! Before this
interview, I had no idea that he carried his peculiar
ideas so far, for I had never questioned him so closely
before, but when I did discover the extent of his
mental aberrations - to use the mildest term - I was
both surprised & shocked, & if I did not believe in
his sincerity, I should have utterly discarded him.
I have no reason, however, to question the purity of his
motives, & therefore I put the most charitable construction
upon his opinions - by supposing him deranged in
intellect upon the subject of Religion! Human
Nature is bad enough as it is, & mankind prone
enough to evil, without encreasing our temptations
by removing the barrier between us & our passions,
which a belief in futurity can alone sustain!
In Philadelphia, Owen was more successful - for
he has induced several men of science & some men
of property to join his Community & many families
of respectability.- I saw a letter from him the
other day dated in Ohio, in which he speaks with
delight of his success so far, & says that "old things
will be done away and all things become new"!
A few years will prove the fallacy of his Utopian scheme.
Two of his sons are with him, but his wife & the
rest of his children still remain in Scotland. - All
our leading men here who conversed with him
consider his plans as entirely chimerical.

I am glad to [unclear]he[/unclear] the "Great Unknown" passed
so near your Classic vale, but I should have been
still more pleased had he found out the Poetess -
what an incident it would have been in the
Annals! - be sure, however, to insert his reported
conversation with the Carlow Post-boy. He received
such a warm reception in Ireland, he cannot
well avoid some notice of her sons or scenery
in his next work - his visit to Killarney must
have afforded him great delight, he has such
a capacious imagination for the wild & romantic.
Hast thou ever read the Waverly novels? Some
of them are not only [deletion]ins[/deletion] entertaining but really
instructive - I persuaded Father to read some of them
when I was last at home.- I think thou would
be most pleased with the "Antiquary" "Old Mortality"
"The Heart of Mid Lothian" and "Ivanhoe".- one of
the tales in his last work - "the Talisman" - is a
delightful romance - parts of it are genuine poetry.
I have read it [underline]twice[/underline], & the second time with renewed
pleasure.- We have an American Novelist who
rivals Scott in the rapidity with which he publishes
- his name is Cooper, & he has just sent forth
a new work called the "Last of the Mohicans."
It is an Indian tale founded on the events of
the French war in this State in 1757, & contains
very correct delineations of the Indian character.
As an [underline]American[/underline] production you ought to read it
His other works are "Precaution" - "The Spy" - "The Pioneers"
"The Pilot" and "Lionel Lincoln." - they all exhibit
talent, & have sold very well both here & in
England.- I am well acquainted with the
