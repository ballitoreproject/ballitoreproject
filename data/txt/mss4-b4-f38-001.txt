Ballitore, the 17th: 6mo: 1775.
My Dear Cousin
When I looked at the date of thy agreeable letter to
me, which was the 8th of the 8th mo, I am almost ashamed of myself,
that I did not write something before this time, but think if thou
wert a witness of the many occurrences that have happened since
& of the perturbations of one kind or other that I have to go thro'
I believe thou wou'd not wonder at my being unsettled, & rendered
unfit to sit down to write to a particular friend, for whom we
have a particular regard, & near affection, & of whom we often speak
& think: we often hear of thee by one means or other, the account Eliz:
Pike gave me of thee was very pleasing, of thy haveing made a beginning
to exert thy abilities in service for the church, which thou hast long
seen to be necessary, & I dare say thou had peace in it, & will find
strength administered to perform whatever duty is required, as thy
mind is kept faithful & true to the noble cause of Religion, suffering
its operating power to purify & purge away everything that
wou'd retard so a good a work, & every discouragement that might
cause a looking back, & withdrawing the hand from the plough.
I observe thy mentioning little Hannah's complaining of a
pain in her stomach, which I suppose is better, as I heard of your welfare
in general, several times of late I think, it is very like it may
be worms that causes it, if thou wou'd giver her conserve of rue as much as the size of a nutmeg every
night for a while, & stop for some [insertion]time[/insertion], & give it again, particularly give it
in the spring & fall, I believe it wou'd be of use for that disorder.
I hope Dr. little John's complaints are also removed, his arm may be

be long stiff, & yet recover it's use in time, I find it so among our
lads who have got hurts on the Elbow. I suppose thou hast heard
of the trouble we have had in burying one of our boarders, & of my
illness, & since that the brother of the child that died has been very
ill, it did not seem unlikely that we shou'd have had him to bury
also; but kind providence has been pleased to recruit him so, that
he has been up a few days past, & we are willing to hope we shall
be spared from the disorder spreading, tho' a fever. Thou may think
what anxiety such things must cause us; my health [insertion]& strength[/insertion] have been
restored beyond what I cou'd have expected, it did not seem likely
that I cou'd have got to Dublin meeting, but I think I may say I went
in faith, & tho' I was so weak, that it seemed too far to go, without lying
on the road, yet I got thro' in the day, & did not seem much tired. So
that we see how we are helped beyond expectation, when our hearts
are [deletion]&[/deletion] properly disposed.
I suppose thou hast often heard of thy sister & cousin Tommy's
going on bravely in their business, they seem much hurried they have
so much custom & I hope their exemplary conduct & attendance of
meetings has already been of service in that place where it was
much wanting.
It wou'd be very pleasing [insertion]to[/insertion] our children to [insertion]have[/insertion] the advantage of some
of thy company if it suited, but really our situation requires all their
help, which they willingly give, both in sickness & health, none need
practice more tenderness, than they did to me when ill: our family
has been so large this good while, that we have all enough to do one
way or other; Peggy has a good-deal of care on her as to the younger

children, (her poor aunt being often infirm) it being the time of life
with them, that requires double care, & I think it a favour that our
Elder Children are not taken from us while we are so incapable of
minding our own family, by hurry of business; but I live in hope
that when it please[deletion]d[/deletion]s our gracious preserver & provider, he will make
way for us, to live in a more retired way. We have had the pleasure
of thy mother's company a little now & then, but when she is with
us a while they want her from us to Athy again, but she seems
as if she did not look upon herself at home till she gets to Derrigaron
which I believe cannot be yet awhile, as their house is not finished yet.
'Tis [insertion]like[/insertion] thou has [insertion]heard[/insertion] [deletion]as[/deletion] that thy Uncle Chandlee is like to leave the old house
at last, whether he will take a place in Athy for him & Johny to follow
their business in, we cannot tell, but it looks most likely I think, they
have both been ill, but we hear are better.
I think it wou'd be quite proper for thee to come & see thy mother
this summer, & to bring the children or as many as is convenient to
thee, & we might have her here then, & have you a bit together, which
wou'd be very pleasing to us, she is far advanced in years, & if she shou'd
be taken away before thou sees her, thou wou'd be troubled, so I wou'd have
thee think of it.
We have not got the money from Sr. Richard yet, tho' he gave
expectation of our getting it, in an answer to a letter I wrote him.
With all our Dr. love to thee thy father & children, I conclude & am
thy very affection friend & cousin,
please give my love to Jonathan Aby
My dear cousin, I reced thine, intend to write when I can, wish thou would contrive to
& Molly.
let Bell the attney know that I think he does not treat me well in not either persuading
or compelling Sir Richard to pay me: or [unclear][/unclear] giving me notice that he will not be concerned
about it. I expected other things from
thy uncle Thomas Christy's character of him
