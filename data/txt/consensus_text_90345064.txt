Jossy, Avy, and Richard.
greatly to Polly's regret -
as she wanted me very
much to stay with her
for that day - and Lid
also - I would have
liked nothing better
almost but I thought
I ought to come in,
as Papa seemed to think
it the best plan.
Aunt Eliza Emmy &
Florence all called to day,
They intend going
on seventh day morning
Jossy is going there too
I believe so we can all
travel together I hope.
Elizabeth dined with us
to day - After tea
