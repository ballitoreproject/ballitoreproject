Feb: 8th- 1807-
As usual, my dear friend, I have been long silent,
though never forgetful of you - the truth is, your letter found me struggling
with a fresh distress; & as I hold it to be almost a sin to create
unnecessary pain in the heart of another , I waited in the hope that it
would please God to enable me with an account of the sorrow, to send also
an account of its termination- Jn. , who is now all that is left to me
of my numerous family, was suddenly deprived of the entire use
of all her limbs, & literally had not the power of moving a single joint
for three days she could not bend her head to take in sustenance, but
as another person directed it,- by slow degrees she has recover'd so far,
as another person directed it,- by slow degrees she has recovered so far
as to bear the journey hither, to walk about the House without
assistance & to dress herself - but the Faculty give me little hopes
of her ever enjoying strong health, & have proposed me never to be
alarm'd at the suddeness of any attack she may have - it is supposed
there is something materially wrong [deletion]about[/deletion] [insertion] in [/insertion]the circulation of
the blood in the Arterial system, particularly about the heart.
I believe no one who has the happiness of knowing you, ever suspected
you of " affectation", - I am persuaded that you would sincerely regret the
death of my beloved Bessy, kindred spirits love each other; she highly
esteem'd you, & I know you respected her talents, - but even they were

trifling, compared to the perfect rectitude of her mind. I have a
proud satisfaction in saying this - Amiable, as I ever thought her,
I never half knew her worth, till I examined her papers, & found her
wonderful application & abilities had been chiefly employd on the
word of God - You shall have what you desire, my dear Friend, but it
must be when I have more leisure than this place affords me.
I rejoice at the good account you give of all at Ballitore,- I consider
the time pass'd there, as some of the best spent of my varied life,-
there, I first learnt, that without being a Physician, I might with the
blessing of God, alleviate the sufferings of others, - there, I learnt it was
no great evil to be removed far from the Great World,- & there too, I learnt
to love & esteem your Society, in consideration of the many worthy Members
with whom I associated,- & the more I examine their tenets, the
more I respect them - Poor Abraham will call this a price of my "Bigotry",
but I heartily wish his mind at rest on this important point.
this I do not say to [underline] him, [/underline] only to you - I am very glad the school is
to be renew'd; it was once so respectable that I always greived at its
decay, & yet I could scarcely wish it to flourish under such principles
as your Brother profess'd - Give my Love to Lydia White, & offer
her my sincere good wishes for success, - never forget me to her amiable
Mother, or indeed to any other Friend, for they were all kind &
good to me - If your Works are publish'd by Subscription, put down
Mrs. Smith of Coniston in the List, & whatever the cost is, I will get the
friend in Dublin to whom I enclose this, to [underline] pay where [/underline] you direct.

If they are otherways publish'd, tell me how I can procure a Copy here.
I know not what to say about advising our valuable Friend J. Wilkinson
to publish his Poetry - the expense is enormous,- some of his Pieces are
[underline] truly excellent [/underline] , but I question if a whole volume would amuse the Public,-
& the Public read only to be [underline] amused [/underline] - They wod. too require a great deal of
pruning, our excellent Friend has never had the advantage of Education,
& they wod. abound with inaccuracies both of Grammer & [underline] Sound [/underline], for many
of his Lines rhime only according to Westmorland pronunciation_ I cod.
select a few of his little Poems, which wod. do credit to any Genius, & in
which I perfectly delight, - but cannot say the same of the [underline]whole[/underline], _ I wod.
rather vote for publishing his letters, which are truly original, & very
elegant - All this I say to you in [underline] perfect confidence, [/underline] for I wod. not [unclear][/unclear]
his feelings on any account,  -  & no one can respect his
Genius, or more sincerely esteem his heart, than I do. [unclear][/unclear]
Your dear little Deborah seems to have a Pretty turn for Poetry, but I believe
my departed Angel was right, when she said "a Woman had better be suspected
of being a pick pocket, than a Poet"- tho' she sometimes indulged in it herself.
Poor Burleigh! he was so good & amiable, that I ought not to regret his
removal into a better World, - I had a few very good letters from him, &
wonder'd I heard no more of him ^ but conceived I had only the fate of most
old women, to be forgotten - I should be much obliged to you to enquire
how our Swindling acct, stands with Mr. Bewley, - if we owe him anything
it ought to be discharged, & shall,- but as my Dt. rather exceeded the original
sum I had hopes it might cover all - I have little doubt of my favorite
Richard turning out both a good Scholar, & a good Man, - his sweet open
Countenance excited in my mind great hopes, tell him I hope he will not
disappoint me, but he I dare say does not recollect me - I wish you every

comfort in him, & in all your other Children - A Mother's life at best, is but
a life of varied anxiety; especially amongst us Worldly minded people, who
send our Sons to fight the battles of their Country  - I have one a Lieut: in
the Engineers, in St. Vincent's, - another - & to [underline] you [/underline] I will confess, my [underline] darling Boy [/underline]
is gone in The Expedition under Genl. Crawford's command, I know not whither,
but report says to the Mauritius, & that is consider'd a perilous undertaking! _
I have just heard from tiny Louis, who tells me he is well & happy - off Cadiz, &
that he can "splice & knot almost as much in a day as any Man in the Ship"_
these are his words - Turpin is still with me, but I [underline]suspect[/underline] will not long,- for
she has a Brother in Dublin who will never rest till he gets her, [underline]& her money [/underline]there,
& she has a Lover in England (15 yrs. younger than herself) equally desirous of her,
& her money here, - to one, or the other, I fear she will fall a sacrifice, I shall grieve
which ever [insertion]way[/insertion] she determines, for she is a worthy creature, & like one of my Children in my
affection - May God bless you my dear Friend! I am very sincerely Yrs. J.S_
I shall stay here till the first week in Apl., when I propose returning
to Coniston, where I am build.g a pretty Cottage - I trust you
continue to burn my Letters_
