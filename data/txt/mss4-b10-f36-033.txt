 Glendruid 9th mo 13th 1833
My dear Eliza
I am just after reading Lucy's
letter, and thy small part of it, and as you
both say so much about our writing, I begin
though there is but little here to tell of.
To ease your minds at once Florence is finely
the swelling in her neck has been lanced and
quite gone E says; it was so red and inflamed
on fourth day that they brought her into town
and got the Dr to do it, and now there is scarcely
any sign of it. I saw her this evening she was
in great spirits, [underline]crowing[/underline] & [underline]laughing[/underline], R & E are
both well, and we are well also, my Aunt G
is with them still but goes into town tomorrow
Stephen Gillett is to be in Dublin on first day
& she does not like to miss him. I expect she
will come back & stay with us next week
Mary G is very dull, she has been discharged
from Britain Street & her school is very small.
she spent second day last out here, the Cuthberts,
Dr Litton's nieces & nephews came here

on that day, they seem agreeable and unaffected
people, the [underline]Dr[/underline] did not come so don't be
jealous, perhaps he is waiting untill thou comes
home. Hannah Perry was [insertion]here[/insertion] yesterday she came
to ask about Nannie, and has hired her, she
justified getting one that has lived with my Mother
and that she can depend on what she hears of her
than one of those that will be ever so well recommended,
she says that if she dont mind
what is said to her she will not keep her a day.
There is no news flying here, the newest is
a proposal for Rebecca Pim one of David Malcolmson's
sons, & I heard a rumour of another from
a Richardson which I cannot vouch for, the
former I believe is true, I did not hear whether
he is accepted or not, 'the money runs to
the money.' Lidy is in town I hear I dont
know which of the children she brought I
wish she would come out and see us this has
been a very dismal looking day, very rainy
and windy though not as bad as this day
two weeks, it seems a great deal longer than
that since we went down, my Mother is
talking of going down soon again, she says that
it will be more convenient for her to go

now than to put it off, she has less care now
than she will in a month. I suppose R &
E will be going the latter end of next month
and then she will be so busy with all the
houses that it would be out of the question
her going. I dare say once she gets down there
 and is simply settled, she will stay very contentedly
Dost though ever intend to write to me
again, if so I think it is time. I am slow
to hea[unclear][/unclear] Emy is growing good, and hope she may
[unclear]continue[/unclear] so, is her language any more [unclear]intelligent[/unclear]
[unclear][/unclear] tell Lucy that Sarah was
asking me very particularly how
she looked, and whether she was
growing [underline]fat[/underline]. Mind I do not spell that last
word with a double [underline]t[/underline] as Frank does, I
wish he could get to town, and finnish his
shop with all the needful things, I long to
hear of his being busy, and having plenty
to do, but I hope it is to come, give my dear
love to him & Lucy, and take a share for
thy self from thy affect sister Selina
I heard nothing of the Henry's since my
Mother bid me tell thee that if thou wishes

to come [insertion]home[/insertion] to do so, to write us word that we
 may know when, if thou dont feel stout she
thinks thou ought to returnd, but it is all at
thy own option she says thou might tell
Sally that she intended offering them the cottage
on the road for the winter before she heard they
had got a house for themselves. Betty has
got a daughter, she is finely I saw her on
second day it is very like old Paddy.
Farewell
[underline]For E Barrington[/underline]
