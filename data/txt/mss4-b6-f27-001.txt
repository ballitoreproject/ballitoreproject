Excuse me for making so bold but as you
are the only person that did do anything for me
with respect of getting me a situation I expect
you will do what you can once more to get me
into some sort of Business anything beyond
Labouring as I am sure of that at any time
and no other expectation at present. This being
the last hopes I expect you will do what you
can as I am ashamed to go speak to you
