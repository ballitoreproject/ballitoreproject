I know not will it be welcome: but
yet think I ought not let slip the opportunity
of inquiring after the health of my Aunt &
the rest of my relations & requesting my dear
Cousin Mary may take the trouble of writing
a line of information - Thy last Letter being
accompanied by the few trifling articles I
had left in Ballitore I conceived there was
no longer any footing for me where I had
the only slender pretensions of an Home.
I was debarred of more than two or three
minutes of Cousin Abm's company by
his particular engagements when in Waterford
so that from him I could not learn what
change

change time might probably produce in
my favour. The reception I met with was
friendly which gratified me not a little
Please present me affectionately to all at
home & to Cousins F & D Chandler when
opportunity serves
I am thine sincerely
