drop thee a few lines to acquaint thee thy kind and
acceptable favour 22nd 9th Mo came safe to hand TW

but am afraid it will be hardly worth room but as my
mind is often drawn towards you in much love thoughts
would find a few lines am pleased to hear deer Anne
Taverner is so finely recruited Oh what a kind father
[unclear][/unclear] have my heart has been melted down under a fence
of the goodness and mercy of providence towards me
in my illness how seetly he comforted me when no
earthly thing could have done it my Friend the greatest
wish and desire that attends my mind is that the
remainder of my days be spend in pure obedence to the
will of the most high that is alone worthy of honour
how comfortable is my present sittuathon to what it has
been and only for dear Cousin Abraham feel heavenly
looks could not have bore it so long as I did and I would not
tempt me to go through what I did for if had all to do over
again could not take more pains to discharge my duty
at Ballitore but hope Cousin M is comfortable now that I
have left it and Cousin L thinks her felt better of so hope
we are all in one mind for am sure that I am better of
for I have lost a shameful deel of time with them to
neither credit nor profit S Ward me sometimes talkes
of paying you a visit am doubtful my visit would be

uncomfortable to some in your Village but, but flatter
myself theare are some who would be glad to see me
think it is more talke than any thing else without sister
Nancy would accompany me to the summer meeting
