Ballitore 30/4 mo: 1786 -
My dear affectionate friend
S: Dillioyn,
I many times since the receipt of thy very acceptable letter
thought to send thee a few lines, but could not with convenience, beside I
wished to meet with some way to send it thee without much expence, as
I do not seem capable of writing any thing that would be worth it - but I
know thou would be pleased to have a few lines of any sort from me, & expect
I may get some way to send it to the other side from Dublin. It was
very pleasing to hear you had so good a passage over, & perhaps it was
better for thy health that thou went sick also - but it was not pleasant to
hear that after thou went so finely recruited, that thou should be so unthoughtful
about it, & get cold by not taking care to air thy clothes properly - I think
it was a convenience to be nearer the Ship, near the time of your going, &
doubt not the friend's willingness to do himself the favour of rendering
you kind offices, it in his power; he seems a well-disposed young man, I
mean W:C. I expect Molly will let thee know about the packet thou
mentions'- my children, & all of us had good right to make our habitation
agreeable to thee as we could; & the return of thy health & loss of thy cough
gave us real satisfaction; & I wish thou would be a little more steadily
careful, without watching, to keep from taking cold, as thou are apt to do
without care. I believe thou wilt excuse this freedom, thou knows' my
manner of plain speaking, but it is in true love; for really thou hast
been dear to us since we knew thee, & often thou art the subject of our conversation,
& I hope we shall long (if life be spared) continue to have affectionate
regard for one another, & when we can, desire each other's welfare
&

& prosperity in that which will render us happy when time shall be no
long[insertion]er[/insertion] that we shall not be wanting; for, dear friend, the witnessing a
growth in experience as to religion, & a concern to get from one degree of
grace & saving knowledge to another, will be our greatest advantage, let
this one or the other think what they will of us, the keeping steadily
in a humble dependent state of mind, tho' we may be counted fools, is the
[deletion]right[/deletion] safe state; for in that is the approbation of the Father of his children
to be inwardly felt; & if we have the evidence that we please him, it is
enough - this is my sincere desire for us; & as we grow in years that we
might be more & more valiant for his cause, & bear his cross before all
we may have to converse with, & in our lives be preachers of righteousness;
& tho' our own weakness may be great, his strength will be administered in
the time of need, if we are faithful to him, & depend wholly upon him.
We had expectation of our dear Betty Pim's company some time ago,
but the weather did not suit her health - Sally has been from us ever
since, with her Sister at Clonmel while she was lying-in, & mostly since
I suppose at Saml. Neale's, it's like she may come to Dublin-meeting. We
have had a trying winter, I was very ill after I parted thee in Carlow
at dear D. Watson's (who is since quietly removed I hope to a happy roof.)
& mostly very indifferent the winter, not so well able to bear the cold
as usual. Molly laid by in bed or room, for a time with pain in her
head or jaw, & not long recovered from, till she had pretty full employment
attending poor old Nanny, who was so ill in the Ague, &
so reduced that it seemed hardly likely she could get thro' it - so thou
may think how we were situated - Mr. Hudson helped us in Nanny's place; but
not being used to stir much, I helped her at times; & now Nanny is got down
stairs, & I hope by that means, I shall, if health be permitted, get to Dublin -
Our daughter D: Chandlee had not either M:H or me with her when she

was delivered of a daughter, but thro' mercy got it over, is now striving to nurse.
She has had trouble some time before, having buried as sweet a son (Richard)
as one would see I think near 12 months old: I hear lately she got a fall down
part of the stairs, which has retarded her growing so stout as she might have
done - Our daughter Grubb has also had a young daughter, & is always I suppose
a good nurse; but has a weakly child to care for, not the youngest. 
Abraham's children are some of them indisposed, so their Mother, in consequence
not very well. I apprehend it would be pleasing to thee to hear about
us, so am rather particular - Divers of the frds. of Rathangan have had [unclear][/unclear] trouble
thou may remember we called to see dioers of the indisposed: dear Tommy Watson died,
& I hear reckoned he believed it was best for him to go then, as he had a hope it
would be well with him, but if he lived he did not know how he would be
tempted - & dear Sally Neale, who had long been ill, also died (I hope) in an acceptable
State: & I hear gave much good advice to her Sisters - but poor Isaac Jackson
has had cause for deeper affliction: his daughter whom thou may remember we
[deletion]we[/deletion] went to see who seemed greatly swelled, proved a great deceiver, & to have
done very badly, & another young woman in the same neighbourhood also:
poor young Isaac Jackson very ill, & his recovery doubtful - colds & trouble
I suppose have brought him to it - And thy frd. Anne Forbes's daughter-
in-law whom we saw at Josa. Wilson died some time after, & her eldest
Son married to G. Penrose's daughter also died lately - thus we see trouble
visits one family after another - an uncertain stage we move on - Saml.
Haughton's wife of Carlow has had another daughter, a fine Child: but both
her's have been ill, now. [deletion]One[/deletion] Our Son received a kind letter from thee yesterday,
in which thou seems anxious to know how poor dear Zacharias is: he was
most of the winter at Joseph Inmans very poorly, got to Mt. melick Qrly
meeting & grew so much better as to have acceptable service at the Select
meeting & [underline]I heard[/underline] at the women's meeting I being obliged to keep the bid

at John Gatchell's with much pain & illness, but was favoured to get
well home - I hear Z:D: joined M Ridgeway, &c in a family visit to that monthly
meeting, & was so well as to get to Waterford & Clonmel, & to go from
Waterford thro' Co: Wexford & Wicklow to Dublin with Anne Elly, he not being
stout for riding - I wish to hear from thee whenever thou can, mentioning
thy near connexions, as I think myself interested about them, & if I cannot
write to thee again, I hope thou will excuse & really it is difficult to me, my
sight is so weak, beside other impediments - but thro' all joined by our family
in dear love to thy husband & our other dear frds, am thy very affte & sincere frd
Eliz. Shackleton
Poor Nanny's dear love to you, wonders that such a one as
she should be so remembered by such frds & that A. Jones
should be so kind to her, & she so shamed that she could
not properly acknowledge it. We are concerned to hear of our 
Dear frds being so pained - Our Dear love to them & all the fellow-labourers
as thou hast opportunity. I hope they will endeavour to be clear before
they go, that they may not have to come back; Dear Anna Still
suffering.
From ES to Sarah Dillwyn.
