Monk Coniston, Kendal
Sept: 5. 1801 —
My dear Friend
I desired our amiable Lydia to assure you I would
[unclear]wr[/unclear]ite soon, - I do so therefore, not only for my word's sake, but because
[deletion][/deletion] I would wish you to believe me incapable of forgetting either
[unclear][/unclear]n, or the very kind & uniform attention you bestow'd on me —
Now, dear Mary, you know my sole reason for writing; I have nothing
to communicate which can please your head, or satisfy your
[unclear][/unclear]iendly heart; — all my prospects are at least dull, if not dark, —
The Duke of York has limitted my purse to the verge of Penury,
whether it will supply my Wants (for comforts, I do not even dream
[unclear][/unclear]I cannot say,— yet, feeling as I do, support from an Higher power,
[unclear][/unclear]her to provide for the future, or to fit me for what it may produce.
[unclear][/unclear] to enjoy the present, by doing the best I can; & leave it to Him,
Thos. Wilkinson was with me at the time Smith arrived, & we
[unclear][/unclear]d mutual pleasure in enquiring after you, & those we love at
[unclear]B[/unclear]allitore; I try to persuade Thomas to pay you a visit, & then I
[unclear]des[/unclear]ire you to introduce him to dear Mary Bewley, whom I want
[unclear][/unclear]im to bring to Yanworth; desire her, with my kind love, not to
[unclear]w[/unclear]ell all on his face, but to contemplate his beautiful Mind, - it is
liberal, noble, & benevolent, as it is pure, & innocent! I always

receive him with pleasure, & part from him with regret; for I have
the highest esteem & regard for him — Tell M. B. that Kitty too, says
she should like very much to see her at Yanworth — I am for dispossessing
an old Jew of a Tanner [deletion]from[/deletion] [insertion]of[/insertion] his Estate, & fixing the worthy Thos.
Bewley & his amiable Wife in it — I have too, a [underline]great House[/underline] for Abram
& my honour'd Lydia, (but that as Abram & I have quarrel'd, I fear we
[underline]must[/underline] fight if we must) I have abundance of neat, white, comfortable
Mansions for all the Spinster Friends— & be assured, in this Emigration
my much loved Mary Leadbeater is not forgotten — Thus, am I in
idea, fixing my friends around me, without considering that
perhaps I cannot long remain here myself, for if War continues,
& Taxes encrease, I must bid farewell to my favorite Country, & try
if the Isle of Man will afford me sustenance for a short time, & finally
a few feet of earth to lay my bones in — I am glad to hear that
dear little Richard has recover'd the full use of his Knee, he was
such a promising, fine fellow, that I should grieve to have him
injured — Louis boards at Hawkshead, & goes to the Grammar School,
I doubt whether I must not send Turpin there too, for she cries &
frets herself to fiddle-strings, altho' the Boy never look'd so well, or
fared better in his life — She is very proud of your present, & says, "it
was so very kind & condescending in Mrs. Leadbeater to think of me, pray
Ma'am give my duty & thanks" — I have just parted from my Bess, &
a dear Boy of 13 (my 3d son) whom I had not seen of some years - they are both

gone to the Friend who [insertion]has[/insertion] brought him up; I am perhaps more gloomy
than usual, for the Boy I doat on, & Bess is a serious loss to me — in
her firm Mind, I have ever found support, — & in her unerring, steady
principles - comfort! Kitty remains to cheer me with her smiles, &
soothes me with sweet attentions,— & Jn does all she can do to please me,
I literally [underline]toil[/underline] in my Garden, & fancy my Cabbages are particularly
good, because my labour contributed to their growth — I feel more proud
of seeing my Garden free from Weeds, than ever I did formerly on surveying
my best furnish'd apartment - You would laugh at the importance
with which I look amongst my Peas & Beans, & proclaim that
I am sole Gardener! Thus, dear Friend, you perceive that Pride is the last
thing we part from, — but I forget that I am writing to one, whose humble
[unclear][/unclear]nt-Mind, has no conception of the [underline]meaning[/underline] of the wor[unclear]d[/unclear]
[unclear][/unclear]nky is so healthy, that my medical skill [unclear]lies dormant[/unclear],—
& something I must be doing,— I cannot accompany my Girls in
their rambles of 20 or 30 Miles a day, & so I weed my Turnips &c &c.—
We have had the finest Season imaginable, the Crops are abundant,
Plenty once more promises to revisit our Land; & we only need, that
"the Lord should give his People the blessing of Peace!"-
I shall send this dull Epistle to Ld. Sheffield, conscious that it is
not worth postage. — but as you can never plead the same excuse,
I beg you not to wait for a Conveyance, - both your last Letters were
many Weeks - I believe I might say Months - on their road,— & I shall
always pay a Shilling with great pleasure to hear from you —

Farewell dear Friend! accept of my sincere Regard, & remember me
very kindly to my own Circle at Ballitore — I am affectly. Yrs.
Tell M. & S. Bewley I do not like the name of [underline][deletion]Cowslip[/deletion] [insertion]Primrose[/insertion] Cottage[/underline];
to my ear, it sounds affected & romantic, & [insertion]wd.[/insertion] lead[deletion]s[/deletion] me to suppose that its Im[unclear][/unclear]
must write [underline]Novels[/underline],— if I did not [underline]know better things of them[/underline] —
