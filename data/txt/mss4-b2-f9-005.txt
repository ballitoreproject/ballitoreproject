[in pencil] [1/8/1772]


Dear Cousin
                                My wife received a Letter from thee some time ago, to which she wants not affection to make reply, but is much cumbered, besides the daily necessary care of her large family, with some Building. She therefore desired that I would send thee a line, to let thee know how we are. Through the great Kindness of Providence, my Betty has been better in health, I think, since her Return from Dublin than for some time before. Sister is also of her best fashion. Our children are pretty tolerable, one or other of them pretty often ailing a little. My Debby in the County Carlow, drinking Garyhill Straw. Cousin SamCarleton lodges with Sister still, & is company for her. It is agreeable to us to hear of your Welfare, & that ye are conveniently supplied with means for the education of the Children. I doubt not but the young Man employed as Tutor is under proper qualifications, & is also a good Example among them. I have also a secret hope that the Little ones will grow up to be a help & comfort to thee. And in order that it may be so, & that the Lord may delight to bless them. I doubt not but it is thy solicitous care, to nurture them up in that Simplicity of manners & appearance, which Truth leads into, & carefully & assiduously to watch over the tender plants, lest any budding of Pride, or any wrong shoot, spring into, & frustrate the gracious intentions of heaven in any degree towards them. Many Parents, it is to be feared, in our day, have been miserably deficient in the education of their offspring, checking, hindering & preventing that which ought to be cultivated in them; & cherishing, forwarding & encouraging what ought to be rooted out & destroyed. And hence it comes to pass that so little Tenderness of spirit & amiable Simplicity is to be seen in our youth, & very little of a Succession of Testimony-bearers is in prospect: one of the first temptations thrown in the way of Children, after the age of Infancy, being a little Finery in Dress, & the Convictions of Grace remonstrating against it being resisted, the Reproofs of that Divine Monitor (through revealed [word crossed out] resistance) become less forcible, less clear & less fell, & so disregarded too much. And hence for want of Faithfulness in the little, & in the early discoveries, there is not a right Growth experienced, but the contrary prevails, & here is one great reason that the city of our Fathers Sepulchres lies waste. I write not, Dear Cousin, as doubting thy care in this respect, but may it be our care, more & more, by example & precept, to train up our Children in the way they should go, as the most probable means, with the Divine Blessing, of preventing their departure from it in their riper years. And if there should in our families fall out some Exception to this general Rule, yet we shall have the Comfort arising from a conscious Sense that we have done all in our power, & are clean in the sight of our great Judge, the chief Shepherd who committed this little Flock to our charge. And being thus conscientiously careful concerning ourselves & our own private families, we are drawn farther to look over the more extensive family of our Religious Society, & as Truth gradually opens our minds, & enlarges & sanctifies our understandings, we may find it our concern to speak a word in the Church, & in the families of our Friends, by way of Discipline; expressive of our experience & feelings, reviving in the remembrance of others the Zeal & Piety & Christian care of our Fore-fathers, & magnifying, & making honourable in their Eyes, the Laws & Statutes, the Rules & minutes, & Queries delivered down to us. This Branch of Duty, Dear Cousin, also, I doubt not but thou hast looked at; but a contemplation of the Extent & Weight of it, & the want of help-mates in Discipline have much discouraged thee from putting a hand to it. I am not for putting my self, nor any other more forward in this, nor any other religious service that the Master himself shall require, in whose hands are Gifts & Qualifications which alone can edify his Church, & in whom alone is the right Putting-forth, & the times & reasons for it...But there is in the Church a form of Discipline prescribed & when we are at the stated times assembled for the support of it, having our own hands measurably clean, & our Eye single to Gods honour & the Welfare of our Brethren & Sisters, we find a duty in these matters naturally devolving & incumbent on us, as our reasonable Service; & as Wo is to those who are called to the Ministry, if they preach not the Gospel, so also Wo is to those concerned in Discipline, if they do not faithfully & honestly & assiduously support it. As to the particular Concern of last half-years Meeting in bringing women-friends more regularly & effectually into their proper share of the discipline, the Plan which they have laid down speaks clearly for itself, & endeavors should be used by Province & Monthly Meeting to carry it into Practice. If in any respect it be not clear to Individuals, or particular meetings, superior Meetings should explain it; for it particular persons consulted should from their various apprehensions differ from one another, or from the Intent of the Plan itself, there might Irregularity & Confusion, instead of greater Order & Regularity, be the consequence.
        I salute thee, Dear Cousin, in much affection: I hope thou will soon write to us; for thy letters afford us a particular satisfaction, & renew much nearness in our minds to thee & thine. My wife, Sister & children join me in the same kind Salutation to you all (my much respected friend thy Father-in-law included). I wish you all the best of Comforts, which alone is sufficient to supply every want & deficiency, & to support & conduct us safe through the Remainder of the various dispensations ofGood & Evil yet allotted for us, to the end of our wearisome pilgrimage; & remain thy truly affectionate friend & cousin.
