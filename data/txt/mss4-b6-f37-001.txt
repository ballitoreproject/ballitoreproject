I dully received thy Acceptable favour

Left the [insertion]day[/insertion] it came, & Cousins J.B. & L. T. the day after
it was very agreeable to hear thou got safe to Clonmel & wd.
be still so to find thou had a pleasing journey home with
The additional favour of meeting thy friends in health,
thou over rates dr. Molly any little attention of care
towards thee when here, & wish it were in my power to be
useful to my fds., all I can do is but little, but friendship
still prompts me to recommend attention to thy shape, in sitting
& standing, as a little observance of that sort may be of real
service in that respect, & was pleased on that Account thy
stay in Clonmel was short. Thy fondness for little Anne &
carrying her too much was I believe hurtful do I make
too free if so place it to the account of that friendship wch.
induced me to take the liberty I did when here & still continues
to think in time in wishing thee to exceed or excel many thy
equels in years & thy prosperity in every thing that tends to
thy well being here & hereafter

Claim your [insertion]attention[/insertion] on such Occasions, my wish is it may be a happy one to
her, & by all I have learned of the Young Man it wears a promising
Aspect, I doubt not cousin Debbys Anxious Solitude to move
under Divine direction the Continuence thereof is what will
entitle to that Peace that Sustains thro the Various Probations to be
met with while in times & from which now are altogether exempt,
