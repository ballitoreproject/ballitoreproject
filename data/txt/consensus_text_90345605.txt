an interesting conversation with
Mr White after tea about slavery &c &c.
He goes to morrow morning to
Dublin and has offered to take
a parcel for me -, which he says he
will deliver [underline]himself[/underline]. Unfortunatel
I have not got one but intend to
tell him to [underline]call[/underline] at any rate -
He says he is sick of the whole
water system entirely and has not
derived any benefit from it. in
which conclusion many of us
think he is mistaken.
Coming up the hill on our
return this morning - Just before
tea.
15th Monday - A beautiful day -
We took our usual [underline]lovely[/underline] walk
this time and on our return
Ned went to his bath while I
accompanied by Miss [deletion][/deletion] [underline]Code[/underline]
accompanied Miss [deletion][unclear]Longard[/unclear][/deletion] [underline]Cook[/underline]
