bearing witness with our spirits that we please him, will bear us up
above the little contingencies which are apt to perplex and annoy
185
us, as well as above the floods of temptation and tribulation, which
seem at times ready to swallow us up. And if the counsel of perfect,
unerring wisdom be, that any shall be serviciable in his hand, for
promoting the great Cause of pure and undefiled Religion upon
earth, such may assuredly expect a double portion (the portion of
an eldest son) of trials and temptations, and siftings, & exercises
in order to peculiar winnowing, and purging, and pruning, and to
a preparation and qualification, experimentally, to minister to the
various states of others.
I had satisfaction in attending the Yearly Meeting. It was
remarkable for the establishment of a Women's Yearly Meeting, which
I hope will, in the course of time, and in the order of its course, prove
of service in our religious Society. The men seem to have slept a long
time over this matter; but now, like the rib which was taken out of
Adam's side while he slept, I hope it will, in process of time
become a true help meet to the men in the Discipline of the Church.
