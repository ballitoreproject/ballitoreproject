Carlow 1 mo. 14th 1809
Dear Mary Leadbeater
Thy acceptable letter with the inclosures
are recd. & I return this thanks for the favour - Thy friend F: Smith
with the melancholy catastrophe of L: Barboulds husband is truly
affecting & unaccountably singular - to behold a man of fine parts
attacked with insanity - and reserving the ebbulitions of it for the wife
of his bosom [underline]only[/underline] is really extraordinary & beyond our powers to develope -
the malady in its best state is grievous - but when turned
into such an unnatural channel must be doubly so - especially
when we consider the sublime, & almost divine object, of his aversion,
a woman whose writings have tended to moralize & religionize
the world, & whose classical elegance entitle her to
rank with the first poets of this or any former period - when
we behold such a character subjected to the most poignant
distress - we may exclaim in scripture language the ways of
the Lord are as a great deep, and altogether beyond our finding
out - And are not my friend many of the most grievous
trials - frequently the lot of the righteous - and is not this
a further confirmation - that this is not the place of our rest,
but that we have, or ought to seek after "a house not made
"with hands eternal in the heavens, whose builder & maker is
God" - I have read & admired many of the sentiments of thy
estimable friend - Lefanu & inclose the letters left with me
& at some future period, I hope to be allowed, to take a few
more extracts from them - many of these appear to me like
gold tried in the fire & wch. looses none of its weight, by the reaction
of the furnace - if this friend of thine & of the human
race shoud ever bend his course towards this part of the
vineyard - I shoud be gratified by his making our house his own

I wish success to the work you have in hand - and were it in my
power to contribute towards the stock - I wd. gladly do it. -
The Magazines for last month are come to hand & forwarded
by our friends - and contain an increased stock of valuable information -
in the Biographical sketches thou wilt find the
life & character of Theophilus Lindsay depicted & to the
honor of our age - such a character has rarely appeared in
the world - a most excellent Theophilus indeed - "a Naturalist
& a Divine & all of God Almightys making" this
I think was Wm Penns testimony of George Fox - and
surely a greater than Fox is here - thou wilt also meet
with a piece on jewellery said to be written by thy old
friend my son - wch. will not lessen it in thy estimation
it breaths the language of humanity & benevolence, and
I think will not disgrace a pupil of your classic groves
I find at the conclusion of the Magazine some strictures on
thy further attempt to [unclear]glossofy[/unclear] thy friend & their reasons
for not inserting it - I do not wonder at thy personal attachment
for him [insertion]as[/insertion] an [insertion]old[/insertion] [deletion]a[/deletion] friend - but have often wondered at
orthodox friends from mistaken & partial apprehensions
endeavouring to reconcile his political conduct - with any
rational ideas of the christian religion - whose grand
characteristick is "glory to God in the highest and on Earth
"peace & good will towards men" - now my friend
this mans political creed was as opposite to this
divine & sublime precept - as light is from darkness
Affectionately farewell Sam Haughton

15th
give our dear love to Sally & Betsy we have miss'd them
much - the arrival of our other fds. has dissipated they gloom a
little. but alas they [deletion]are[/deletion] also [insertion]are[/insertion] about to depart. this inauspicious
morning - I fear E:B may suffer by the exertion - her health seems
far from vigorous - and will require great nursing to keep it in action
