Ballitore: 11/3 month 1789


        It is not that I apprehend myself any way furnished for a communication of this kind, beyond the course of ordinary conversation, that I sit down to address my beloved friend; but I had a mind to keep our correspondence from gathering rust by lying by, & to rub (if not brighten) my end of the chain. Thy dear sister S.W. very opportunely handed me thy last letter. Like an old-fashioned friend she made it a point to attend the monthly-meeting, & aiming directly & honestly at it, was not disappointed in her intention, as some others were. I think we should be cautious lest we get into a habit of making dispensing clauses for our own convenience, remembering that the magistrate is not above the law, but the law above the magistrate; & that precedents set by authority will undoubtedly have their influence, & be often occasionally quoted. Let us be fair & candid practitioners in our own Court of Conscience, & we shall not be Novices, but learned adepts in the law of the Spirit. It was very pleasing to us here to find that dear  though the years of her pilgrimage have been as yet few & evil, is mercifully helped through one indisposition after another, like wave succeeding wave. No doubt the dispensations allotted to the dear child are in infinite wisdom, a cup tempered with bitters, salutary both for her, & her anxious mother; a rod uplifted for the purpose of keeping low & humble, & in the eligible station ^state^ of chastened children. May all that has passed, things present, & yet to come work together, my dear friend, for thy establishment in Good, & for the reducing, refining & preparing thee to fill with propriety & acceptance the station appointed for thee, by Divine Providence, in civil & religious life  [page number] 128 Mayest thou ever be willing to be any thing [sic] or nothing in his hand, doing, & suffering, acting & refraining, not according to thy own, but according to the Will of the great Master  Then, no doubt, being thus trained & disciplined, thou wilt in thy movements feel the power ^favour^ & solid approbation of the Head of the Church to thy spirit, & thou wilt quietly & patiently leave all the rest to his ordering.
