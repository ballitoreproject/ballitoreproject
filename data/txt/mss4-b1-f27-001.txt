8th.. of 4th.. mo: 1778. Joseph Tomey related in
a most awful manner, in the Women's-meeting at
Carlow, a vision, which he had seen, & which he told
not, he said in ostentation but in great freedom.
He saw the wrath of the Almighty over England, he
saw the Almighty clothed in fire, he saw our Saviour
clothed in fire, & a Sword of fire in [insertion]each of[/insertion] their hands; he
saw a mighty army [deletion]At[/deletion] of Men and horses clothed in
Fire, & he heard a voice crying, "O England! England!
"for thy disobedience, & transgressions, & swerving
"aside I will punish thee." And concerning this
Island he saw a great water, & a great Hammer
in the water; & the ambassadours of the Lord went
over Hills & Mountains, & through briars & thorns,
& by intreating & persuading brought some to
our Saviour, who laid them on the Anvil, & with
the Hammer broke them to pieces, & then washed
them in the River, & put them together again,
& breathed the breath of life upon them, & put
them in green pastures. And he did believe
there would be a day of trial, which would try
our Faith, & draw us nearer to each other & to the
fountain of Life, & would be of inexpressible
service to us.
