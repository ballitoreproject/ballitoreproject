Eliz. Dale to Eliz. Baymer
[Skipton, 26 Aug., 1762]
Dear Cousin,
Tis now several years since the correspondence between
thee & me was dropt but not withstanding that, I have often thought of
thee; particularly of late, I think few if any days have gone over my
head, but I have had thee in remembrance: many & various are the
times I have passed thro' since I wrote last to thee, & tho I am still but
young in years, I have met with a good deal of trouble on various accounts,
part I confess of my own bringing on, a consideration tending
rather to aggravate than alleviate them. I have been near six years
married to a young man, & neighbour with whom I had contracted
an acquaintance when I was but a girl, but knowing how disagreeable
the match would be to my father, I trust not on any consideration consent
to it in his life life-time, but engaged my self to marry him, if I should
survive my father, who was suddenly removed from [insertion]us[/insertion] by death; presently
after the affair got out & reached the knowledge of [underline]friends[/underline] who took unwearied
pains to prevent it, & laboured with me in much love to desist
& refrain his company, but all to no purpose. I can't express, nor believe I shall
ever forget the conflicts I had betwixt known duty & a foolish inclination;
the last prevailed & I fled from the faces of my best friends,
(I thought them so even then), to rid myself of their kind & well meant
Importunities. I was greatly dissatisfied with the step I took, even at
the very time I was taking it. I knew it was wrong & after my marriage
was for three years (tho I regretted my unhappy state & the cause of
it) in a kind of a gloomy, lethargic disposition of mind; but afterwards
growing more & more uneasy under it, I became desirous to
make publick confession of my error, & beg to be reconciled to my
friends, for whome I had all along entertained a loving regard, I

 I accordingly writ a paper in much sincerity of heart (& I hope some
degree of true repentance) to the monthly meeting, desiring & hoping it might
have been accepted without my personal appearance; but [underline]friends[/underline] thinking
that necessary two months after, the monthly-meeting being held here,
I had notice of it given me, & that friends expected me there. I went into the
men's meeting (I may truly say) in much awe, fear & trembling: the
paper being read, questions agreeable & necessary to the occasion were
asked to me to which I was too much affected to return any other but broken
& almost unintelligible answers. [underline]Friends[/underline] compassionated my
case, & in much love & charity granted my petition since which time
I have been favoured with their tender regard & notice, tho' I can't get to
meetings as often as I coud wish; my husband has no aversion to friends,
yet he is not willing I shouâ€™d go when I am likely to be wanted at home
which, on week-days especially, is frequently the case, as we keep a little
shop, & my husband often works at his own trade.
And notwithstanding my heart is in some respect more at ease than
before, yet I have still many difficulties to encounter with. I have three
children living, my oldest a fine girl, who was taken away from us
before she could go alone, & has continued with my husband's mother ever
since, who is unwilling to part with the child & the poor little creature
is already often distressed to know how to behave betwixt us, she would go
to meetings with me & use the single language, but tells me she dare
not for fear of offending her grandmother whom the child is very fond
of. I long to have her home, but my hysband will not allow me so much
as to hint my desire to his mother, but I hope if I live yet to gain that
point my little boy & girl at home if I don't live to seem them up (or probably
if I do), may fall into improper hands, & under the tuition of people
who far want of having a proper care over them, may expose
them
