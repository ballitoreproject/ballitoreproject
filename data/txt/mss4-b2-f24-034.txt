My dear Father


        I received thy kind letter of 27th instant ^ultimate^, & since have been at our Province meeting in Limerick, where I met with our dear friends Samuel ^& Sarah^ Neal, they were there some days before at the Wedding, which was accomplished the 3 day before, & I understand in a satisfactory mannar [sic], they seemed but poorly in health, Samuel seemed a good deal exhausted in his bodily strength, but very lively & fresh in his spirit, I thought him much favoured with & replenished with life, he appeared at each meeting, & the first day evening opportunity, Molly Watson also appeared at the last mentioned, very prettily I thought, I trust she is taking root in a good soil, & that she will be enabled to bring forth fruit with patience, acceptable to the Master, & to the living Members of his Church. Joseph Garrat also was there, & also appeared. I thought upon the whole it was a profitable meeting, my Husband & I went in our Cab: very snug. Samuel Neal desired his dear love to you all when I wrote, to be sure to his faithful correspondent Sally; some of us called to see Joanna Taverner, she keeps her bed mostly, & looks very badly, she asked for Anna, & asked several questions, I told her (I think) I intended to mention her when I wrote to you, please remember me affectionately to Anna. I am concerned to hear by Cousin Betsys letter to sister, that sister Lydia & the Child continue poorly, I wish to hear a better account, I hope Abrahams return will cheer her, I fear her anxiety about the Child hurts her, she has my dear love, & near sympathy, I know what it is to be agitated in like manner, our Elizas eye is better, I begun to dip her in fresh water, I did it twice, at first I thought it seemed salutary, but to day I think neither her health ^or eye^ seem so well, I am already staggering about Youghal, I am apt to think thou art right in doubting about that excursion, but I expect Mary Dudley & sister Hannah are now in London, Brother Thomas I hear, (but have not seen it) got a letter from Sister Hannah, informing they landed in Minehead, her letter dated I think from Bristol, did not hear that Robert Dudley &c. were landed, sister Hannah 3 days I think at Sea, supposed R:D:s more tedious. sister [sic] Hannah did not give expectation of going till late, the best beds I suppose bespoke in the vessel R:D: went in, & plenty of good accommodation in that Joshua Strangman engaged, so Sister went with him, beside a Carriage full was fixed for travelling in England, so that poor sister Hannah had a dull prospect of travelling with R:D: & beside Robert did not like to have the care of her, & Joshua Strangman was pressing for her company & very kind, just 5 of them (with her) for two carriages. I forgot, & made a great omission not to mention my dear Cousin Betsys [sic] kindness in her addition to thy letter, my dear love is to her, I am obliged to you all, but am afraid you entertain too high expectations from me, I am a poor creature, scarcely able to keep above, or feel for myself, much less to feel the state of others, at times in freedom I ventured in a select or private opportunity to make some little remarks (as ability seemed to attend) in freedom, not I believe stamping it much higher, & this only where I thought the Church be appointment, (or in the nature of discipline) gave authority. If I did not offend in so doing either the Head, or living Members in his Church it is well, & a great favour, I am not worthy of the least of his mercies, may he vouchsafe graciously to guide me by his counsel, & after all visible things are done with, & the warfare ^ended^, receive me into glory: this is what I crave, this is only worth living for!
        My dear love attends you all, joined by my Husband, & conclude in haste, almost dark
                thy dutiful & affectionate
                        Margaret Grubb
