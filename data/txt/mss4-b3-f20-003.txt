Ballitore: 8/3 month 1792.

Dear friend,

	I doubt not but that our beloved sister D Darby acknowledged for me the receipt of thy acceptable letter  it conveyed the sorrowful intelligence of the removal of our mutual dear friend Mary Merryweather  & this goes charged with an account of the translation of another precious servant from works to rewards. Our well-esteemed friend & brother Samuel Neale had of late years been rather on the decline as to his health, & these last three or four months grew much worse  was seized with a mortification in his foot; & notwithstanding all the medical skill & labour bestowed, departed this transitory life 27th ultimate: his head had been much confused, & his thoughts deranged by the opiates, which it was judged proper to administer to him  but, at intervals of recollection & clear understanding, he put forth the evident, sweet & savoury fruits of a sound mind  of a mind supported by divine, effectual help, which enabled & authorized him feelingly to express his triumph over death, hell & the grave. His travels in all parts of the world, where our religious society was settled, at one time or other of his life, caused him to be very generally known; & the sweetness, liveliness & tenderness, which accompanied his gospel-labours, made him to be ^very^ generally loved  so that it may be said of this Samuel also, He died & all Israel lamented him. My youngest child, Sarah, had for a long time been attached to him with filial affection, & when she heard of his dangerous state, posted to him, 
with our free consent  she was much gratified by an assiduous attendance on her honoured friend for several weeks, and was present with him, to her comfort, at the final close. Thus the righteous perisheth, but I [page number] 299 hope it cannot be said that no man layeth it to heart  I trust these dispensations to the church, ordered in infinite wisdom, are laid to heart by many, of our youth especially, & that there will be a succession of fishers, & fowlers & hunters who will diligently seek after & preserve alive the precious prey of the souls of men. +++
	I observe when thou favouredst me with thy last thou wast on the eve of a journey  I hope it proved agree prosperous  that peace was the effect  & peace the reward. I am glad when I hear of thy excursions in the service of Truth  such exercise strengthens the spiritual constitution  & the example of those, whom Providence has been pleased, not only to endow, but to bless, with even this worlds affluence, hath a powerful influence  of how much greater weight & use must it then be, when spiritual gifts are added to temporal loans?  Bear with me, dear friend, & do not refuse the word of approbation & encouragement, when it comes rightly to thee, or at least from a well-meaning spring  trouble & discouragement are plentiful enough. You rich men are really to be pitied, & demand the cordial sympathy of your friends  I am thankful that there are a few of you, who bid fair for escaping the wo [sic], & entering the kingdom, though it may be through great tribulations and afflictions of divers kinds. Tis but holding out a little longer, & the sense scene of probation & conflict will be over with us all  then our spirits shall centre in the mansions prepared for them  but our example & precedent may operate long after our existence here  as is said, He being dead yet speaketh. May the cause therefore of Truth & its precious testimonies ever be dearer & nearer to us than any other consideration, & let us, like faithful Abraham (the friend of God) in our heart & will, sacrifice very natural feeling & affection to that allegiance, which we owe to the supreme command, & good pleasure [page number] 300 of our great Creator, manifested to us by the Spirit of his Son. This appears to me the more likely means to draw down the favour and friendship of Heaven upon us, & to procure & preserve to us in a better & happier state that which we have, under a sense of duty, offered in our hearts, a sacrifice to the Lord.

	Thy sister D. Darby favoured my daughter Sarah with a letter not long ago, advising of her and Rebecca Young being outward bound  I heartily wish them good speed. They are taking the high road to heaven, thus diligently exercising their gifts, & having it as their meat & drink to do the will of Him that sent them. My best love follows them where-ever they go  & ^I wish^ me & my family to be remembered by them for good  dear Anna Taverner has been us ^here^ some time; but is lately gone to Dublin, in order to proceed on some religious service in this province. I understand she is at present laid up in that city by indisposition, which is frequently the lot of her delicate frame. I hope our mutual dear friend Priscy Gurney is well  her retreat from Ringwood no doubt was melancholy, & she has intimately felt the loss of her precious friend & companion ^ss^  but I trust the cup of mourning has been sweetened to her taste by that union & fellowship, which death cannot divide. Please present her with my dear love  I am obliged by thy information respecting our friends returned to America  shall always be obliged by any new, material intelligence concerning the affairs of Truth on that, or the neighbouring continent  Be pleased to remember me affectionately to thy wife, thy mother, thy brother & sisters at the Dale, to my dear friends Anne Summerland & Suky Applyby. My wife and children join in love & respect for you all, & in cordial salutation to [page number] 301 such of you in particular, as they are personally acquainted with  My good friend Richard Dearman is 

gratefully remembered by me. N. B. Our next half-years meeting at Dublin is to begin 29th proximo  the National Select meeting to be held the day preceding  I really think some of you English, or Welch friends might ought to come over & interchange visits with us.
	I am, dear friend, with true regard & esteem
		very affectionately thine
