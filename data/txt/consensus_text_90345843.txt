31 Tuesday Went down and met
Bessie, she had come out by the
10 train and was with Polly when
I arrived at the station - it was so pleasant
to see her once more - She and I
had a long chat on the strand where
we were very comfortably located under
a sand bank, and where we dined
into the bargain - for when dinner time arrived
Polly, Margt, Phil, Avy and Lyd
arrived too and with them some prog -
so we had a pleasant laughy time of it.
