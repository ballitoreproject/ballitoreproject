My dear Mary, it has often concernd me to leave
Thy friendly note so long without reply. indeed I think
I feel so strong an attachment & love for thee that I could
almost venture to write thee even if i had not received thy
note, but its not so much the great learned part of thy
character (which I hear so much talk about) that I am
so much taken with,. but it is a certain something easier
felt than described which I partake of & enjoy not only
when sharing thy company but also[insertion]when [/insertion] my mind visits thee
Alas d.r Mary I know of no one inclined to take
a little lass in the station thou mentions for unless
we have plenty of labour or drudgery I think we
seldom hire them. I wish some of the good rich
people co.d begin and take such children with a view
of improving those who scarcely have it in them
never to improve themselves. If thou wishes to continue
thy practice in cow pock, and if the infection is exhausted
I will try to procure thee some only drop me a line
Our little spot is very delightful[insertion] in any view [/insertion] being greatly refreshed
by the wet. a continuance of wh. does not hurt it. I believe
its since thou was here that we have [unclear] made[/unclear] a new garden &c
