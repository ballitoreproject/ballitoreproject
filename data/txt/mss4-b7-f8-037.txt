Dublin 24th Secondmonth 1789
I received my dear Mary's favor dated
on the Anniversary of my first [underline]entree[/underline] into the
famous & flourishing City of Dublin & supposed
I should ere now have an opportunity of returning
thanks in person - but my delay here has been
protracted much longer than I expected. WP has
returned home & left me alone to settle accounts
with the Agent to the Glass Manufactory - his absense
from Waterford could not be dispensed with, nor can
mine without much inconvenience - so that I fear
my visit to Ballitore will be only for one night
if I can even attain to that - I am now removed
to a more eligible situation for my business No 15
Fleet Street at the House of Thomas Darcroft
to

oblige whom I enclose John Yeates Draft on R Bayly
Â£20. at 20 days sight which Cousin Abm. will I trust be
kind enough to have presented for acceptance &
return whether honored or no to TB - lest I should
not continue here - how long my stay me be
I know not but think it must be 3 or 4 days at
least perhaps longer as our Agent here is not one
of the most expeditious or persevering men in the
world - I was concerned to hear from P Roger
of the removal of Susy Haughton before I left Waterford
Poor Sally has suffered much - much more than her
sympathizing friends ever apprehended - the expected
change will (I hope) be for her everlasting advantage.
I am anxious to be informed how this critical
time has turned out or may turn out with Cousin
Debby - I wish Athy was in the direct road to
Wa

Waterford - I fear I shall not have the felicity
of seeing her until I come expressly to pay a
visit to my Friends. This extra-ordinary job
I have got in Dublin will necessarily throw me
back considerably - as I have mentioned Pat
it may not be amiss to inform thee that he has
shrewd expectations of becoming a Father in process
of time - his Spouse has been in a delicate [unclear][/unclear]
of health for some time past
Farewell my dear Molly - I shall attend
To the Commissions contained in thy letter - With
affectionate salutations to all at home, I conclude
Thine
