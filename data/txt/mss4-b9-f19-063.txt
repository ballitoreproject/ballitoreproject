My dear Elizth
I have just heard of a Carman & scribble
a few lines to say we are well at home, we
return'd on 2nd evening after a very pleasant
tour thro' the Lakes, we were disappointed
in not seeing Thos Wilkinson - he was from home
so we left my mother's letter with Barbara
for him as I hope soon to see you I will
not enlarge now I could get very fine English
Muslin for thee for 2/8 per yd & some Irish
almost as fine for 1/10 with with dear love to all
thy SB
I do not exactly know
When I shall go to you
but I believe early next
Week
