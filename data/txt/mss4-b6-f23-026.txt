In princely halls or martial shield [insertion]fields[/insertion]
No more shall Gualbert shine
It [unclear]crushes[/unclear] the joys which [deletion]quiet[/deletion] virtue yields
In Vallambrosas shades be mine
27/12 mo: 1815
Now lest the love of humankind
and every sense of joy
The murderer's secret haunt to find
[deletion][/deletion] my role my dire employ
Sweet is the gale which mildly blows
Thro' Vallombros[deletion]i[/deletion]a's shade
Yet here no comfort, no repose
My tortures have allay'd,
My bosom once all light & gay,
Throbb'd high with youthful pride
calm was the night, serene the day
My brother at my side
O Hugo, brother of my soul
Most dear wert thou to me
My frantick thoughts where'er thy roll
[deletion]For[/deletion] Returning fix on thee
Pleasant our childhoods golden hours
Pleasant our youthful day
Bright sparkling as the vernal showers
Beneath the sunny day

Accursed be that bloody hand,
Which dealt the deadly blow,
Fierce rushing from the secret stand
And laid my brother low.
Soon ceased the gallant youth to feel
Soon sigh'd his Soul to rest
[deletion][/deletion]
Mine is the wound
[deletion]Deep rankles[/deletion] the murderous steel
Deep rankles in my heart
[deletion]and robs my soul of rest[/deletion]
Rising with all her direful train
Has mark'd me for a prey
Feeds on my heart, distracts my brain
And sweeps my peace away.
[deletion]No more my pitying heart oe'r flows[/deletion]
[deletion]With love to humankind[/deletion]
[deletion]That guiltless joy which heaven bestows[/deletion]
[deletion]No longer soothes my mind[/deletion]
To see his pangs, his gushing blood
Sweet to revenge 'twoud be
[unclear][/unclear] what [deletion]that[/deletion] form glides thro' the wood
The assassin - yes tis he.
And he is here - & at my feet
Why suffer him to live
Why said I that Revenge is sweet -
'Tis sweeter to forgive
That silence, those imploring eyes
That emblem thus display'd it
Of Him who in death's agonies
Even For his [deletion]assassins[/deletion]Murderers pray'd
Oh they have conquered, & this heart
A heart of flesh once more
[insertion]Now[/insertion] Heal'd [deletion]is[/deletion] the wound & sooth'd the [unclear][/unclear]
Can love, repent, adore
That tide which left my lonely heart
The love of humankind
No longer now by hate repress'd
Flows back upon my mind
Turn'd in upon myself my sins
My vanities I view
So here my second life begins
I bid the world adieu
One only case my bosom knows
The murderer's haunt to find
