Dear cousin [paper pasted over name]

++++ There are but few people proved with the possession of riches that are of use & ornament in our society. We see their general conduct verify the remark of our great Lord that it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom. To profess to be of the kingdom, to have notions about the kingdom & the laws & polity of it, is one thing; but to enter into i, & be indeed subjects of it, is another. This indeed requires much stripping & deep humbling. May we be so happy, dear John, we & ours [sic], as to bow low enough to enter this kingdom; I believe we neither of us are much anxious about heaping up riches, yet both of us considerably encumbered with business. Let us therefore be careful to make the best use of the intervals of recess from the hurry of business, & mind to endeavour (as a friend wrote) to keep up the daily sacrifice. It is hard to be much in the world of business, without being somewhat tinctured with it. There is need therefore of the renewing of the baptism of water & the Spirit (or in other terms spiritual water) to cleanse from every defilement of flesh & spirit, & there is need of a renewing of the unction of Truth to teach us all things which concern ourselves & others. +++
	I am, dear John, very affectionately thine
		Richard Shackleton
