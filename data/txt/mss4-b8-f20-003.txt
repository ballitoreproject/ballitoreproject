of ours, my own, you know, is small; my faithful old Servant, and
[insert]she[/insert] has her niece, another Mary Johnson, to help her; for some times I have
company - My Son remains single, and continues on his farm, about
4 miles off; all his children are at home; he now has a tutor
for them, to advance them still further in learning the Classicks, &c.
in which, I believe, they are making rapid progress; he himself having
first laid the foundation, and brought them far forward: Richard,
the first born, is turned of 16, and Charles, the youngest, is 7 years and
a half old; the second Boy, Morris, when about 9, thinking it would
please his Grandfather, begun to translate - "The Gospel according to
"Saint John" - from the Greek; [underline]not having read it in English[/underline]; as his
Father chose he should [insertion]read[/insertion] the Greek only, until he became master
of the language: He finished translating it, without asstance, before
he was 10; and well done it is, for such a Boy; being in divers
places, an improvement, or superior, I think, to the version in present
use: it is a [underline]rare[/underline], if not a [underline]singular[/underline] performance; very gratifying
to me, you will suppose; he has since learnt the characters,
and made some progress in Hebrew; but at present is pursuing Botany
chiefly, and forming a Hortus ficcus; he is an extraordinary genius,
modest withal, without being conscious of it, apparently: They
are lovely Children all: Richard, much of a man, is very active and
helpful to his Father, in Business and the oldest Daughter, Hannah,
now 15, has been Housekeeper some time. My son, I believe,
is skilful in every branch of his Business; besides agriculture,
he has much improved, in fleece and carcass, a large Flock of
Sheep, from 2,000 to 3,000 - more or less - their number, of course,
frequently varying: The Spanish, or Marinos, have been introduced,
and great competition has arisen, of late, among Breeders: He
begun early, and is supposed to be the foremost; having obtained
several prized, for the best show, at exhibitions in London and other
places; [deletion][/deletion] Silver Cups of various sizes,
[insertion]have been adjudged to him,[/insertion] some large, worth Â£30. - or more;* also a Gold Medal, for an
Essay on a subject proposed, in agricultural science. But, alas!
[underline]what of all this[/underline]? It may be supposed [insertion]by some[/insertion] perhaps, that I exult at
this, his worldly prosperity; or am lifted [insertion]up[/insertion] thereby: - far from it, such
are mistaken; they know me not; it is far otherwise with me: I
often have been, and often am, brought low, deeply humbled, on his
account, on consideration thereof. Success is necessary, laudable,
endeavours for the outward support and comfort of ourselves and
families, if we have families, is desirable certainly - "If any provideth
"not for his own, & specially for those of his own house, he hath denied
the faith, and is worse than an infidel" - Even infidels so provide.
Here we see those endeavours are not only Lawful, but necessary;
but they must be kept within due bounds; and their fruits, the produce,
rightly used, not abused; they ought neither to be pursued nor
enjoyed

enjoyed improperly; so as to interfere with, obstruct, or supercede
the one thing needful; that indispensible duty, of taking
care for the better part; [underline]seeking[/underline], through divine assistance, [underline]first[/underline]
"the kingdom of God and his Righteousness" - making these our
chief, our [underline]principal[/underline] concern; relying, [underline]in faith[/underline], upon the promise
that all [underline]other[/underline] needful things will be added: Be these [underline]latter[/underline] more
or less, the - "[underline]first[/underline], the kingdom of God and his righteousness" - I
have desired, and do desire and covet, above all [underline]other[/underline] things, for
him and his, as for myself. - Let other things be as they may,
this, I repeat, is my most earnest wish, not for him, my Son,
only, and his family, and myself; but for you, my dear
Cousins, - for each one of yours; and for all mankind!
My Son was gratified by your kind notice of him and
his, on your Letter; he knows not of my writing now, or he
would desire to be affectionately remembered to you.
I should be glad to hear from you, when convenient to inform
me how you fare, - after receipt of this Letter, for I
think I continue with unabated Love to each of you,
Your affectionate Friend and Relative
