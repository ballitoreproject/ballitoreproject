Lisburn 10.mo 29.th 1809
I am much obliged to thee, my dear Friend
for thy kind addition to Betsy's letter, & for thy letter
which I have since received. I am always delighted to
hear from Ballitore. I prize your friendship very highly
but I fear thou meets with a very poor return for thy
letters, for I am conscious that my letters are very stupid,
however be assured that if I was capable of writing an
interesting letter thou should have it; & I must also
say that I am sometimes ashamed of writing so freely
to thee lest thou should think our acquaintance would
not warrant such freedom. - I have sent the Song to
the Magazine office, but it was too late for insertion in
the October Magazine. I was much pleased with the extract
about Candor, which is a valuable and often a rare
quality. - I was a good deal perplexed with a want of
candor about the gloves in Mr. McDonnell which made
me mention the subject to Betsy - I fear it would
not answer to print thy new publication in Belfast -
Smyth & Lyons, the best printers, have more business than
they can do, in consequence of which the Magazine Co. have

a good deal of trouble to have the Magazine printed
punctually - J. B. Trotter has a small volume of Poems
in the press nearly a year, which, owing to his procrastinating
disposition in not returning the proof sheets
quickly, [deletion][/deletion] [deletion][/deletion] will not I suppose appear for a long
time yet. [underline]Two proof sheets of[/underline] Miss Balfour's poems is
all the progress which is made in printing her book,
altho' she is very anxious for its publication, as her
subscribers are displeased at the delay - If thou wishes
for thy poem to be speedily published I think Smyth
& Lyons would not answer - I am told that S. Archer of
Belfast prints neatly but I have seen very little of
his printing - If thou wishes the enquiry to be made
about the expense of printing in Belfast, my father
can very readily make the enquiry when he is in
Belfast. Thou will also let me know how the "Anecdotes"
are to be sold - I suppose Betsy Shackleton will soon send
the gloves, and I hope the Editors of the Ballitore magazine
will have no objection to send the last No. of the
Ballitore Magazine by the same opportunity - My Father
wishes to know if the Belfast Magazines sent to the Editors
is from the beginning of the publication until the time the

Magazines were sent, as he did not wish the 4 returned
unless they had two of one number.
I have not followed thy direction about riding on horseback,
as the horse I like to ride is apt to run off, and
my Father is afraid to let me ride, altho' I have not
the smallest fear of the horse being so [underline]uncivil[/underline] as to
run off with me. The other horse is sober & old, and goes
at a pace between walking and trotting which Joseph
Nicholson calls "Hancock's jog" - I walk a great deal, which
I like much better than riding - I often fear that we
will not go to Ballitore next Spring, but Hope is a
very pleasing companion, and I must hope we will go.
As to what thou says about [underline]fine people[/underline] disliking thy
[unclear][/unclear] thou need not be afraid [insertion]that[/insertion] I have the [unclear][/unclear]
smallest bit of the [underline]fine lady[/underline] about me, which [unclear][/unclear]
is always such a proof of ignorance & conceit that I could
never have patience with a person of that character - I
am sure from what Betsy Shackleton knows of me she
can tell thee that my disposition is far from a [underline]fine lady[/underline],
I am sure I will be delighted with Ballitore, & if our
plans turn out reality instead of castle, or rather journey
building I hope to convince thee that I like something
better than mere outward show. I have not read M.
Edgeworth's Tales of Fashionable life yet - but I have promised
myself a very great deal of pleasure in reading [insertion]them[/insertion] - I have read

the first Volume of "Calebs in search of a wife" - I admire
some parts of it - but something I cannot admire - He is
quite too [underline]precise[/underline] for me. Lucilla is unnatural - & their
long conversations is sometimes very dull - This book seems to
aim at being better than the generality of novels, but it
is very unlike the Cottagers of Glenburnie which is so natural
that I sometimes cannot persuade myself that it is fictitious -
Hannah More's writings are all gloomy - I never could admire any
of them that I have ever read - How different is M Edgeworth,
her writings instruct while they amuse - & she interests the
mind so much that it is an effort to lay the book down without
finishing it - I did not see Mrs. Allan when she was in this
neighbourhood except once at a distance in the street - I am
very glad to hear that Deborah is recovered - My Father had
a letter from Greenbank yesterday - K. Rathbone is very much
troubled with severe headaches - The rest of the family are well -
Mary Leadbeater
Ballitore
I shall be very glad to [unclear][/unclear] from thee at
any time thee has [unclear][/unclear] to write -
With dear love to Eliz [unclear][/unclear] Deborah I am
thy sincerely affecti[unclear][/unclear] S. Hancock.
S Hancock
