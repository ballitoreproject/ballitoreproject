I know it will give my Dear Molly
pleasure to hear I have got safe to my journeys end,
we were several days on the road often wishing to
have a sight of Cork; there must be patience in such
cases, for without patience and hope we could do
little, I found all the family well when I arrived
at home which gave me no small satisfaction, I
should have wrote thee soon after but was a good
deal hurried having been so long away, many
of my relations and acquaintance came to see
me, my time was pretty much taken up till
Uncle Hoare came which [deletion]which[/deletion] was in two
days after, then visiting begun and such like
so that I have scarce had an hour to call my
own. Cork seems new to me there are several
houses built and parts of the town much improved
since I left it. I wish I could see such
an alteration as there is in Dublin, I regretted
leaving Dublin much having got such an
agreeable acquaintance, it was impossible to
leave them without some sensations of grief

I remember the day I left you I though Ballitore
never looked so pretty in my eyes before
tho for all this I should not wish to excha[insertion]nge[/insertion]
my present habitation, I am like my self
again with the little children about me, a
house I think looks stupid without them, I am
sure you have no want of children in your
agreable village ~
I expect thy Mother by this time is quite
stout as also the rest of the family, please
present my dear love unitedly to them, likewise
my Mothers to thy Father and Mother
& tho she has not seen thy Aunt Carleton
these many years she does not forget
the esteem she has always entertained
for her and wishes she may accept her love,
I hope my dear Sally will excuse my not
writing to her at this time it is not for
want of inclination but time never standing
time flies apace I purpose writing by
the first opportunity, and hope [insertion]thou will[/insertion] oblige by
the first convenieny with a letter thy affectiona[insertion]te[/insertion]
