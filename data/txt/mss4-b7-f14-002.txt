Upon reviewing my memory, I find
that I am indebted to my Dr. Friend, therefore
an oppertunity offering, I wish to pay it
a sympathise in friend, in affliction, is a
comfort to a mind, borne down with trouble
as I know my Dr. Mollys good nature, Im
sure she will be ready to joyn with me, thee
no doubt has heard of the Death of my
poor Sister [insertion]Fanny[/insertion] whose loss to me is great indeed,
and departure out of this World sudden, Oh
my dr:, what have we to boast of, we cant promise
to ourselves even lenght of days, a
little time agoe how promiseing, did hers
seem, but how soon will disorders come.
first we thought it a cold, & swelling in
her troat, from that shortness of breath
& a swelling in her Limbs & body, no medicine
had the wish'd for affect, then my
hope was lost, thee sees when Death comes
theirs no resistance, tho I gave her up
yet expected she wd. linger some time, She
got up every day, & road out when she cd.
the morning she died, I went to see her
found her rather worse then usual, but
had no notion her end was so nigh. She
wish'd to see one of my sisters, which I

went to send for them, but scarse was I gone
out of the room, when she laid her head on the
Womans arm [deletion][/deletion] She went off, without Pain
poor thing, sorry was I that I happened to leave
her, in her last moments, when I wish'd to comfort
her. I believe she never expected to recover
but had no notion her end was so nigh. tho
this was the case I hope she was well prepared
for her change, which I have a secret Evidence
it was a Glorious one to her, who now enjoys
perfect Tranquility, & ease free from trouble the
dayly portion of these She left behind, how lamentable
the many disagreeable matters, theres in
our society of late, better it wd. be for some [unclear]as[/unclear]
she had witness the stroake of Death, when these
and many other thoughts arise in my distress
mind, why shou'd I wish her back, to a troublesome
World; may we be thankful sufficient
for the many favours bestowed, and endeavour
to be content with every allotment of kind
Providance, who knows whats best for us not
repining at his Will, knowing not what greater
affliction may come upon us, I have lost & must
rationally Lament, my Sister; my friend, & dear
companion. well let me not dwell too long on
this melancholy thame, but endeavour to enliven
thy mind, who no doubt often is gloomy
having the same expectation of the prospect of
death in yr neighbourhood, poor Anna Taverner

how undesirable is her situation, & must
Life be to her — I intend to send this by sister
Hannah, who is now relased from her confinement
by the happy removal of her Daughter.
Sister A. Robinson, is finely recovered to who
she was, tho looks very thin, & think her health
far from being Established, I wish she may be
sensable of the great favour, of kind Providance,
in restoring he so miraculously, and for
the future make proper use, of the time alloted
whether long or short, as no doubt but some good
if propperly applyed. - thee mentioned poor Unfortunate
Hannah Jackson, how distressing has her
disorder turned out, distracting must [deletion][/deletion] it be
[unclear][/unclear] her poor Father, & relations, what a min[unclear][/unclear]
[unclear][/unclear]ust she have, loded with her own Inequ[unclear][/unclear]
a scandal to her sex, a shamefull reproach
to our disordered society, how thankfull ought
those to be, that is preserved in Inocence and
virtue — this family true mercy is well. I was
obliged in my trouble to wean my little Boy
who took it very well, this sircumstance was
no small consolation to me, as it was a tryal
to put him from me, now my Dr. hoping yr.
family may equally enjoy, a perfect state
of health, with my love to them all accepting
a large share from thy ever Affectionate frd.
