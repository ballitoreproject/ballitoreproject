Lisburn October 5th 1810
I have delayed writing for more than
a week past, that I might tell you how I had settled
with the Belfast booksellers but they are so
procrastinating that I do not like to wait longer
for them lest you should think I was negligent -
My Father has requested F. Houghton to pay Betsy
Shackleton some money & when I know the amount
of the books sold I will request Betsy to pay you -
the remainder of the money she can place to the
glove account. Please tell her I have received
the gloves. I will keep the account as she directs -
I have [insertion]not[/insertion] received a letter from Ballitone for several
weeks- surely Deborah & Elizabeth cannot have
forgotten me. I cannot expect Betsy to write
regularly as she has the school & the straw to
attend to. I hope Hannah White has quite recovered.
My father is much pleased that J Johnson
& Co are likely to publish the Cottage Dialogues. He
had a very high opinion of the late Joseph Johnson,
who was thought to be the most liberal printer
in London.
I have not seen Charlotte
with the last magazines to Carlow- I fear this [deletion]little[/deletion] letter
will be rather unintelligible as I have written in such a
hurry, & I have been interrupted so often but I shall not take
up your time with apologies - With love to all who will
accept it, I am your very affectionate S Hancock
Betsy desires her love to you all, she has quite recovered her
grief at parting with Mary Shackleton, & she & Ellen have
declared they will not allow me to write any more until
I take a walk with them to a fruit garden a mile from town,
so I must gratify them.

Brooke's poems, but I recollect that Dr. Drennan
recommended me to read them - I will ask the
Doctor for the poems, & if I meet with the one you
mention I will copy it for you. Do not my dear friend
make any apology about any little commission, as I
assure you I am always delighted to oblige my friends.
My Father desires me to say that he does not think
a place could be procured for your friend in this
neighbourhood.
I suppose Betsy has received the books I sent;
I hope you will admire them. I have almost finished
reading the life of Leo the tenth. I cannot admire
the character of Leo but I am very much pleased
with Mr. Roscoe's sentiments. Have you read the
Lady of the Lake yet? My Father has been reading
some sermons to me - They were preached by the
late G Walker of Wavestree near Liverpool. My Father
frequently met Mr. Walker at Greenbank, & esteemed him
very highly; the sermons are ex[insertion]c[/insertion]ellent, & I am delighted
when my father has time to read to me - In winter
he generally reads to me after tea. I believe no
one was ever blessed with a better or more affectionate

father; indeed his constant study is to gratify me,
if I wish for a book he immediately procures it
for me, & [insertion]in[/insertion] short he is unwearied in his wish to
amuse & instruct me. How much do I owe to
such a father!
Our little school succeeds much better than
we expected at first - & I only regret that our
room is too small to admit of more than 48 girls,
however we intend to get a larger room very soon.
A very large house is now building in Belfast for
[unclear][/unclear] for boys - I regret that they [unclear][/unclear]
not admit girls, as I think their education
is of great importance. What has Betsy done with
her flax - Mrs. Hamilton has established a house
Industry in Edinburgh; she employs most of the
poor [insertion]in the house[/insertion] in making lace. But I think Mr. Reynolds
(Mrs. Rathbone's father) has established a much
more useful institution in Bristol. After poor
people are discharged [deletion]from[/deletion] public hospitals
as cured they require more care & restorative diet
than they generally get in their own houses. Mr.
Reynolds has established an institution to support these
people until they are able to return to their labour.

He calls it the Samaritan society, & has I believe
purchased an estate as a permanent fund for the
institution - Mr. Houlbrooke wrote to me that he
had in a sermon which he preached at Mr. Yates
place of worship proposed a subscription for a similar
institution, but the Physicians did not seem
to approve much of the plan. He & Mr. Roscoe have
proposed a plan for permanently relieving such persons
as are imprisoned for small debts. I hope
they may succeed, as I think it is a plan productive
of much good -
