My dear Eliz th
I got thy kind note oh why didst thou
not speak ? I was thinking if I could coax thee
to come here for a little while even, When thou
would have no company at home, then we
might settle all these little matters between
ourselves, I would not like to speak of them so
soon altho' I intended to begin early, but I have
no patterns & if thou visit here thou could supply
me, now do think of it, besides I am so very
lonely ---- I paid J lumming my mothers hir
& enclose a receipt & also a letter from F Fisher
to Lydia which came enclosed in half a sheet to
Edw while we were away, poor Manliff us
no better yet the doctor has pronounced his
illness to be bilious __ I intend to go to see C
Fagle as soon as I can I hear she is to spend
a while with A Caster __ If thou gave me
any commission I forgot it so mind to send
me word, with dear love to you I conclude
Has J Williams gone home yet ? thine S B
