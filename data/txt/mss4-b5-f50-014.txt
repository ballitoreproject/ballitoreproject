who was acquainted with you all to become [underline]too[/underline] studious
among you. - This goes by Dr. Hewsy who [insertion]will[/insertion] [deletion]will that[/deletion]

he brings with him. -

any of her letters, I should be much obliged by

justly & express herself so admirably on all subjects.
Nathan Hunt a ministering friend from America is expected

house will be pretty full to-morrow. -
Dr. Harvey & I called at Capt. Rammagins yesterday -
he was not at home but is duly expected - I suppose the
Doctor will see him before he leaves Scotland & will give
[unclear][/unclear] Month 12th 1820
Farewell -

Athens
