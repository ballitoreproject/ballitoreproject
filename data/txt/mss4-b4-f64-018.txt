Ballitore 6th of 3rd mo: 1814
My dear aunt
I received thy very acceptable
letter by M. Clarke & am obliged for thy care
of my mats; if they do not sell I will thank
thee to bring them home - I hope thou
will return at mo: meeting, which I had
some hopes of attending, but have now given
up as I see no prospect of company.
I have no doubt but Dr [unclear]Mahorg's[/unclear] kindness,
& politeness will induce him to do all he
can for thy poor eyes. I most earnestly
wish Peele may be of service to them. I
hope Anne Maharg is better again? I was
at the Mill to day, after meeting my aunt
likes the worsted very well & thinks it will
match her stocking. Thy letter telling of
Samuel gives recovery was the first account
I heard of his illness I hope he has
had no relapse - was he seriously ill?
I am very glad poor Maurice goes to S. Joss
as I think it may be of use to him -
he certainly has a good heart & a feeling
one, too much so for his station I believe
he has been hardly treated & to his affectionate
nature nothing was harder to
bear: I never could think him mad, but

he may be driven to madness by unkindness.
I do not wish to apologize for his foolish
extravagance, or childish vanity - perhaps I
had better not speak of him at all.
I cannot wonder at thy often thinking of
our worthy friends [unclear] AW [/unclear] A.D. they are staunch
I will thank thee to give my dear love
to M. Webster - remember me also to Lucy
I would add many more but that I think

To
Sarah Shackleton
at S. Haughton's
Carlow
my love not worth their acceptance I am
glad my aunt is well my dear love to
her at all events - I write in haste & have
taken a profile to write on in mistake
Farewell my dear aunt
Thy Elizth Leadbeater
