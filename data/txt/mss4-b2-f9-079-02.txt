From the same to the same

Ballitore 30/6 month 1789

My dear cousin,

	+++ At Carlow poor ^cousin^ Jonathan & Phebe Carleton were in a melancholy way -- each appeared drawing near the close, & as it were at equal distance from the goal. I trust the merciful hand of gracious Providence will lead them both safely through the strait & gloomy passage to a place of endless rest. This I doubt not was the happy experience of dear cousin A thy honest, sincere, well-minded, affectionate sister, our very particular, faithful friend -- What a happy circumstance it was, that thou seemed as it were led by the hand to take a final farewell of her. How wonderfully things are ordered & way made for those who cast their care on the everlasting husband, father & friend, who continues to care for his little ones, & having loved his own will love them to the end! The sudden removal of this old acquaintance, relative & family-friend is nearly felt by some of us, & the cordiality of her attachment will be long remembered -- if long can be properly applied to our short & uncertain state of existence +++ Remember us all affectionately to thy father. I wish him best comfort now in the decline of his ^a^ well-spent life, & that as his days so may his strength be. ++
	And now, my dear friend & cousin, farewell. Many have been thy strippings many ways, & close thy trials -- Mayst thou happily be favoured to feel inward support under the reflection of the past, & the pressure of those which may be yet to come -- that so thou mayst be enabled to rejoice in tribulation, & bless that hand which doth all things well!
	Thy faithful, affectionate
		Richard Shackleton
