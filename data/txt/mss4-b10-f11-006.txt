My Dear John
You ask what are the
motives that would make us become
good walkers, I think it would not require
any very strong motive to make
me one, if I had any one to accompany
me, for I am very fond of walking, but I
suppose you will say if I [underline]had[/underline] nothing
to hinder me I would [insertion]find[/insertion] excuses for not
doing so, but I hope that would not
be the case.
You were angry with me for running
down Luggelaw, I think I was wrong
in doing so, as I think it is a very handsome
place, but I like other places I
have seen much better, but I believe
it was more for the pleasure of talking

(and that you will say was a very silly
reason) that I said what I did, [deletion]again[/deletion]
I am often more sorry for saying too
[deletion]little[/deletion] [insertion]much[/insertion] than too little.
The strongest motive [insertion]but there are many others[/insertion] that influences,
me to excel, is [insertion]I believe[/insertion] that my friends
may think more highly of me, and
more worthy of being beloved by them,
also the pleasure I should feel myself
in thinking I excelled in anything,
but I am afraid I am often too indolent
to take the pains, that are required.
On reading what I have written
I am inclined to think I have not
answered [deletion]them[/deletion] [insertion]your questions[/insertion] to your satisfaction
but you must make allowances for
me, for when I read your letter, I
thought I should not be able to answer
them at all. Lucy says she is patiently

waiting and quietly hoping
for a letter from you; and I hope
you will write to me if you have
time, if it be but to scold [underline]me[/underline]
and find fault with my letter.
I remain your affectionate
Emily
