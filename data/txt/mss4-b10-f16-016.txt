May 10th 1824
Dear Eliza
I received your letter with a great
deal of pleasure, because it was quite unexpected; I little
thought when I saw the postman, that it was to me the
favour was coming. I was very oblivious [underline]that[/underline] night
at my aunts, when I forgot to bid you farewell, I did not
think of it till I was in bed and would have gone the next
morning early, only I thought you were gone to the boat
to see Ann Shannon off, you will excuse me I know, so
I do not feel much about it On reading over what I
have written there seems to be a great quantity of
I's in it. I intend doing as you say with respect to the
Sheet of paper in the Shop, this is a beginning.
He is gone! there appears to be a blank in every thing,
no matter what subject my thoughts carry me to, he appears
to be a necessary part, as [deletion]if[/deletion] we never had any separate
interest, no parent could have more influence
on us, but it was by not exerting influence, he left
us perfectly free in all our actions and by that
means we had no views in which he did not enter
into our thoughts and in which the blank left by his
[underline]absence[/underline] seems to have the effect of making all our
present views stand still.

13th. I am at my desk this morning, and not having much
to do, I take out the Sheet and pen, which I keep in the desk
to fill by degrees for you, as you wish. I went to the
Glen on Sunday to breakfast, your mother and Mary went out
the night before, and Sally B and Jos Fayle had got out before
me; they were some relief to my mother and the girls, for
indeed I pity them during the week, they have so many opportunities
of missing him, but for my own part I prefer being
by ourselves at present. I went up after breakfast to the
grave, and Sat down by it, to commune with myself over
past times, every happy day I look back to, he was a sharer
in, and the very last time I was at Glendruid with him,
the Sunday before he took ill, he was planning excursions
and we were anticipating more happy days, but Alas!
I walked from Tullagh (which now has an[deletion]d[/deletion] increased interest)
over the land, to see how they were getting on in their work
on the farm, on my way home I met the girls with S.B. &
M.G. going to Tullagh I went with them, the wild flowers
were growing on the grave, which two months ago we little thought
 of, the country was smiling around, the grove at Laughinstone
was green and the primroses under the hedge near Tullagh
were in great number than I ever remember but there
was [underline]one[/underline] less to enjoy them, he is happy and we must
not repine perhaps it is permitted them above to look down
on those left behind and to rejoice when we seem to be h[unclear][/unclear]

26th Eliza there is a long difference in the dates to this
letter but business is my excuse. Woe has visited
the world, since I held my pen on the other side of this
Sheet; and He is no more, the noble and the great and
I will add the good for he could not have been bad,
I feel in my heart that He could not, yes I feel more
for his death than any man I am acquainted except -
but it is needless to except those I was going to mention.
I fondly hoped to have been with him It was one of my
dreams which had taken possession of my waking moments
and if I had not such strong ties at home, [unclear][/unclear]
would have sought my happiness in Greece
I cannot look forward to any more cantos of Don Juan
which I would sit for hours to hear Edward read out,
but I have a great many of his works to read yet, which
I look forward to with increased interest, have you seen
his portrait which is in Murrays edition of his works
I know no face equal to his, alas! where is it now
Is it not provoking to think of his memoirs which
he gave to Tommy Moore being burnt, I can scarcely
believe it possible there seems to be some mystery about
it which I hope Tommy for his own sake will clear up
June 16 This letter is a long time with me I now send it with Deborah
along with 6 of Shakespeares plays, write soon and tell me
how you like your new situation Yrs John
