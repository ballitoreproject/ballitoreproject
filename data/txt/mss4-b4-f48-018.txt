Ballitore: 30th of 4th month of 1824
I have been longing to write to my darling Betsy - & now I am at
home again on my own dunghill. Aye, so it may be called compound
with the nice, neat pretty places I have seen abroad - & yet I looked with
delight on a picture which poor Selina Barrington drew on the inside of the
lists of a paper box of Lydia's, represending our little garden, with its appearances
Ah they were kind friends with whom I staid so long - yet let me
complain of uncle Billy. I found in my journal for 1780, that I had rode in
company with him from Garryroan to Clonmel & that he was a very agreeable
Limerick friend. At Limerick [insertion]that year[/insertion] my attachment increased & reviving
whenever I met him, I suppose I thought it was mutual - but I now apprehend
I was somewhat mistaken - for he met me only at Lydia's mother -
to be sure as we were most early people at meeting - he & I held a chat [deletion]constantly[/deletion] [insertion]regularly[/insertion]
while he took his usual walk back and forward, & I fixed myself on the second
seat cushioned & with a boss - the head of which I kept by right of "first come
"first served" - & I lent him my spectacles sometimes at Richmond to read
the paper. Now for all this what little dost thou think he gave me ? -
"The little woman." Thinking to be remarkably agreeable when he proposed
that he and "Jo" should [deletion]walk[/deletion] [insertion]go[/insertion] to look at Tom Taverner's cottage; I proposed walking
with them, it being near Richmond. he was silent-"How far is it?" "an
english mile" says uncle Billy, winking at Lydia - and the way is disagreeable"
of course I was off going- which gratified the old gentleman - for he said
to [unclear]some[/unclear] me, "The little woman wanted to come with us, indeed!" Dear Betsy,
how perfidious is man! And yet somehow my heart yearns to the old
man, now in his 80th year, living with his nephew Tom Taverner, maintained
by him and I believe maintained comfortably, though they do not speak to each other
Poor old Wm. has nothing - tho' once rich-pity but he had staid in his shop & not
minded Prophet hill. I saw his home in the old town - once so neat and respectable,
new and old clothes shop. Yet I hope he enjoys the remnant of life, & he is
kindly respectifully - nay cordially treated at Richmond, where he is made
to take a glass of good Port when he calls, & repeatedly preped. to dine -detto as
[unclear]Sommerville[/unclear], I believe, I am glad to see him cheerful. Alas for dependunt old age!
That Fanny has for two years felt this complaint increasing - I send thee some verses which I wrote to please the children
Jos Fennell came after his cat on huerd plan [unclear][/unclear]amused and Kennedy with the [unclear][/unclear]Pigeons emmaich that he gave her
the name of olleton - but the yellow claw birds thrown to the plot for [unclear][/unclear]of land.

May-day - I may date thus - for my sister Grubb embracing me, said, "Welcome
as the flowers in May." I lodged with her at the meeting time as did her
grandson Francis Davis a fine lad. I visited a great deal, & we had wet weather
most of the time. My ever dear Betty Grubb is very poorly again, but delightful
to me & we enjoyed each other's society. I am sure she is out of health,
Oh! that she & Jos Beale had married five & thirty years ago, when I so wished
it & thought they would match so completely - then she would have adorned his
beautiful mansion & perhaps filled it with beings partaking the virtues & latents of both
& he would not in his advanced state of life have been redicuted for marrying unequally.
But call me not match-maker - I only wished this without proposing it, & know not
that the idea occured to either party. I gazed from Abm. Grubbs fairy [unclear] -palaceon[/unclear] a
prophet so delightful that "still the bright idea charms my mind". I saw several old
friends. I heard John & Sarah Grubb, Mary Watson, Elizth & Rebecca Redgway & Sarah Fennell
from the gallery, & I had an agreeable interview with Tom Hally who came from Cloghen
to see me. Richd & Susan Grubb, with five lovely boys & two girls were at the meeting
Sam Sahe I also saw - Deborah had lately borne a second son. Thos. & Eliza Chandlee were there
I should have liked to have paid a little visit at Cloghen had time permitted. I received
a kind invitation from Mos. a Beale also which I could not accept. How warm
to my heart felt the welcome at home - it was worth the secret [underline]honings[/underline]

welcome be! & most of all dear Eben's & Deb's - with the contemplation of that I dare not
fully entrust myself - having had a hard fight to subdue or push away feelings which I cannot
not nor would not like to describe - however I trust all works for good if we endeavour to
resign our own wills - to be quiet & mind our own business - the business of submission. In minn
matters I found this more easily attained than I expected, & little things fell out for me as I
wished - though not quite as I had planned, apparently by my not being too anxious about
which were almost painful at times - but how much warmer will thy
them. And now to leave the subject of [underline]Self[/underline] - of which I am really tired, & glide gradually off
by introducing a joint stock. I copied several essays at Richmond - I could not compare much, because
my mind was anxious about my child. I read the Round Table, written by Leigh Hunt
& Hazlitt, which they admired there - but I thought it much inferior to the [unclear]Hinter[/unclear] - into which I
have introduced some anecdotes of men & dogs - which make a pretty variety, & I beg thou may
treasure up such in thy memory - also make notes of passing events - of the wonders of London to
which Loquac has extended [underline]its[/underline] tour. [insertion]Thy[/insertion] James Fisher gave me the name of Loquac as suiting
either man or woman. [insertion]In my impurious [unclear]corresponding[/unclear][/insertion] Do, my beauty, I know thou cannt do any thing thou likes. [unclear]Melesina[/unclear]
writes thus, "You think, my dear friend, 'I like Betsy' - as I here beg leave to call her - pray
think so - very strongly - she is delightful - & I envy you to her - & her to you" This, in
cousin Sam's language is "marrow to my bones."

Lord Massey's son. Rebecca & I were greatly admired for our feat, having
walked two miles & crossed some four or five stiles. James Fisher (uncle) was so
pleasant, & told so many school anecdotes, & remembered so many people
that I was glad when he came to Richmond - but after Lydia's lying-in he
came more more seldom, & was evidently struggling with painful recollections
he requested not to be asked upstairs, & when [insertion]Lydia & he[/insertion] [deletion]they[/deletion] met in his mother's room
I thought his affectionate salutation was sad. As for the good, old great grandmother
(observe four generations in one house) when Lydia paid her first
visit to her, [insertion]he[/insertion][deletion]she[/deletion] threw her arm round her neck, looked at her, & then kissed
her repeatedly, & when she sat down held her hand often kissing it. I hope
Lydia has written to you & told about her boy, so dearly purchased, so
dearly loved. I hope our sweet Hannah Shackleton may have less suffering.
We expect [deletion]it[/deletion][insertion]less[/insertion] for young persons - & [insertion]yet[/insertion] Rebecca Eves had a quick, fine time.
It is now near bed-time & I am reminded of Mary Jisker's letter to thy lovely
Avalanche - She proved no Avalanche to me - but thou art more attra[insertion]c[/insertion]tive.
Many returning from Dublin said she passed [underline]thro'[/underline] (perhaps she meant [underline]by[/underline])
Ballitore by night, when she supposed the inhabitants were locked in
the arms of Morpheus [deletion]telling[/deletion] little knowing who was so near them -
& "little caring" - added Sally. So these are the requitals in sentiment
& romance, perhaps mistaken for [unclear]taste[/unclear] & feeling
My dear James drove me through the old City of Limerick, which I could
not but admire, & over old Thomand Bridge, with its flat form & 14 arches -
the pap which was so vigorously defended, & Bath's bridge, where the arches
beneath the houses looked so curious. Tis likely thou hast heard the story of
the man who was roasting a goose for his Christmas dinner in the kitchen of
one of these houses, the floor gave way, & man & goose were seen sailing down the [unclear][/unclear].
the man was saved - probably the goose afforded a treat to the salmon. There is
also a tradition that [unclear][/unclear] walked through all the streets & lanes of this ancient
city, taking an accurate survey thereof - & moreover that the named Ben
[unclear]Fisher's[/unclear] country-box, at Mt Pleasant, "the tea-caddie," & after hearing this I could
not separate the idea of the two conveniencies. Joseph & Rebecca Harvey took me
to Clairville - Rebecca had not been there since Mary died - but Rebecca bleeds
within. We walked through the nut grove, saw the falls of Dunass & passed

I used to take fits of longing to see thee while I was away - now I am easier about
thee which I wonder at - but having commenced philosopher - leave it - Perhaps Mary's
presence may in part account for it & the other dear creatures - as there I had but one of
my [underline]own own.[/underline] Did thou ever speak of the Hinter with Melesina? What a question?
how thou scoffs at it? - Will Theodore come back to Jas. White? Is he admitted a member
of our society? dear Theodore! I had a very sweet letter from Crabbe. I fear
he is declining - he wrote it by piece-meal he says - accounts himself better. though
suffering from pain & consequent languor. He is not sure whether he shall be
able to finish the work he has in hands. Oh! how I wish long life to him & such
as he! What does Melesina say of Ld. Byron? James F: has got many of his poems
which we had not seen, amongst them an affecting address to his implacable wife. Does
Melesina like her? James read me all that was proper of Don Juan - tis a pity
such fine sentiments & admirable poetry should be mixed with improper stuff. I do
not support any of it is so gross as to disgust - perhaps so much the worse. Give me such as
Cooper & Crabbe who hand us the pure, [unclear]pellucid[/unclear] draught of virtue. I could not get Lydia
to finish what thou began upon wigs - so endeavoured [insertion]myself[/insertion] to tack an end to it. But who
is Miss Davis:- choose some other name lest Mary should meet with it. Dear Fanny
Bewley is ill - I fear alarmingly ill - the complaint seems not ascertained - I suppose it is
in the stomach & bowels - she is confined to her room. Tommy most attentive - they sent Lucy
to Dublin. Oh! I wish she may recover - we could badly spare her.
3d.. Mary Haughton with John & Louisa escorted Dr.. [unclear]Mapurg [/unclear]thus far on his way to Dublin
this morning. He gives encouragement to hope for Fanny's recovery. Geo: Bewley, who had
been at Dublin meeting, , hearing of his aunt's illness after he returned home came to see
her & both wept at meeting. Sister Sally has, after contemplating their great snugness
at Thomas Bewleys, felt almost frightened lest some reverse should come. She know not
