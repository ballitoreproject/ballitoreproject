also beautiful - but so extensive
that we lost our way in it
And did not return home
till near 9 O'clock - very tired
with the day's walking -
I should say that Ross Castle
and the island of the same
name in which it is situated
belong Also to Lord Kenmare.
The boys did not return till half
past ten - and only brought home
two trout after their trouble. Before
dinner our American friend called
to know if we would make
a party with them to go the next
day through the Gap of Dunloe
to which we agreed -
28 Another fine day - but very
hot, At about ten we started
on a long car accompanied by
our fellow travellers for the
Gap through the greater part
of which we walked as the
car did not go through
