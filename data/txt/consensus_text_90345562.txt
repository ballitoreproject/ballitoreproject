vapour bath and down I went and
scratched both my elbows - It
was lucky the top was not shut
or I would have been hung by the
head" Oh dear the very idea
of his being in such a ludicrous
position tickled my fancy and
I had much ado to keep my
countenance -
Our walk this evening I shall not
soon forget for scarcely ever had I
seen such a beautiful evening sky
and the effect of the sinking
sun on the trees and fields was
perfectly charming and almost
thrilled me with admiration -
On our return we met Mr Hamilton
Mr Matterson and Mr Sullivan who
stopped a short time to speak to us
and then we pursued our way.
This is a strange place to me -
I am in a sort of bewilderment every
thing is so new and completely
different from what I have been
accustomed to - Poor Mr Coulter
