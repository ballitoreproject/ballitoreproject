She who two years ago was one of
the livliest of our acquaintances, so hearty,
so merry, and so blooming, is now
worn away by her long illness [deletion][/deletion]
[deletion][/deletion] to an mere shadow
of her former self. It was about
this time two years, perhaps a little
later, that she spent a week with
Polly and me at Fassaroe. oh such
a pleasant week - I dont think I shall
ever forget it, and now how our circumstances
ever forget it, and now how are circumstances
married and in her own home, and
Charlotte? an invalid almost ever since
wandering about for her health, and,
myself -? why here to the good still, at
202 Gt Britain St and in very good
health. I am very thankful to say
health - I am very thankful to say -
How miserable we should be if we
knew or could see into the future,
I hope sincerely poor Charlotte may
recover. Well Mama or rather the
car left me at the Station and I
changed, where'[deletion]s[/deletion] is Polly?
