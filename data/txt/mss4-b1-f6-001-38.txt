hands - I continue still in a very bad state of health, &
am very well convinced that I shall never get better here:
a dungeon in Hell would be preferable to it in my opinion
I have been sick now almost ten months: the mortality here
is so great that the plagues of Egypt could do no more
than equal it: in short, I should be afraid of giving you
an ague & fit (what I am well used to,) if I'd let you know only
one half of our miseries.
Have you heard from Sam? do you always remember
me to Shackleton? you never let me know any thing about
that good family. I have wrote to them often, but they were never
pleased to answer me in return. How do you & Wellington
stand? it is requisite, Bob, to make some men of consequence &
fortune our friends: let me know in your next, & remember
me to him.
Now, my dear Bob, I have a request to ask you -
that is; if you are on good footing with the Lord-Mayor, & that
he is the same with the Lord-Lieutenant, he could get me leave
of absence to return to Europe: which would re-establish my
health, & in all probability get me promotion in some line or
other, as I have some men of rank & interest in the army,
who I know would serve me & are much my friends, as I
have experienced: there is no such thing scarce as [deletion][/deletion]
promotion in the West-Indies; every thing is done at home
