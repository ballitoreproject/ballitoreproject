Dresden March 24th 1847
My dear Mother
I wrote to you from this place the
day after our arrival here besides writing from Cologne
& Liege and London - we have not yet received one line
from home and I am getting so anxious that I am not
enjoying myself as much as I otherwise would it seems
such a long time since we left you - we anticipated being
so long on our journey that I suppose it made you think
there was no use in writing sooner however I think a
day or two more must bring in a letter I think it may
bear good news - I threw off my muffling on coming
hear [insertion]too quickly[/insertion] & got cold which is not yet gone but I have not been
[underline]ill[/underline] with it only a sore throat & chest and a cough - I am
now almost well again only a little cough remains -
We spent the evening of the day after our arrival with James
& Ann Jane - James is not like himself at all with his grizly
beard I do not like to look at him & think you would be sorry
to see him so disfigured - he & Thos. cannot [underline]now[/underline] be mistaken for
each other - Ann Jane too is greatly altered she is not well Jas
thinks her dropsical which is the cause of her looking fatter
than when she left home but besides that she has a heavy
look which makes her look to my eye quite a different sort
of person from what she was when she left Ireland - Catharine
is much grown but not at all improved I think either
in appearance or manners - indeed I do not think any
one of the whole set improved for Mr Evans looks very thin
and worn looking - but both he & Bessie may improve when
they are settled - the state of [underline]un[/underline] settledness they have been in
was enough to prevent their improvement by travel -
I do not admire Dresden at all - they seem quite behind us
here in every thing - there are no nice shops and tho' some
of the public buildings and houses are curious still taking it all

together I was disappointed in it - there is a [deletion]new &[/deletion] fine bridge [insertion]newly repaired[/insertion]
over the Elbe it takes five minutes & something more to cross it
at our usual pace of walking - the Bridge of Boats is taken away.
the country around Dresden is reckoned pretty and it may
be in comparison of the country round about but it has
very little beauty compared to what we are used to at home,
On Saturday we walked about a good deal and whilst
we were out Mr Evans arrived from Leipsic where he has been
with the Model for some time - he made an agreeable addition
to our party you may guess - On Sunday we took a walk into
the country along the Elbe and I think in Summer the scenery
would be pretty now with bare trees & bare fields it is not very interesting
James & family spent Sunday evening here and it was really pleasant
all to be together once more we were gay - had tea in [underline]our[/underline] bedroom
as it is the largest - it is a very pleasant cheerful room with
three windows and it being a corner room we have the Sun almost
all day - we breakfast & dine in the public room but have had tea
in our own room I believe every night we were at home On
Monday morning Thos. Bessie Mary & I accompanied Mr Evans back
to Leipsic - the Girls had not been there and wished to see it - it is
a prettier and gayer town than this - very curious houses
and Churches in it - the houses have a great many stories in
them - I reckoned ten in some, four [insertion]or five[/insertion] of which were in the
roof which gives a very curious appearance as the roof
are almost as perpendicular as the house itself - many
of the Churches are the same way with four or five rows
of windows in them [insertion]that is in the roof[/insertion] they are not flat sky lights but project
as they sometimes do in our roofs at home with a little roof over
each - We started at six o'clock in the morning from this [underline]after[/underline] breakfast
we got to Leipsic about 1/2 past 9 and went to Mr Evans Lodgings where
we had coffee we then went out about the town to make some purchases
of Clothes (for we found we could not get what we liked in Dresden)
We dined at a "restoration" as they call them near the railroad
which Thos. & I had found convenient & comfortable when [insertion]on[/insertion] our way
to Dresden by ourselves - We again walked after dinner all round
the old town which is [insertion]entirely[/insertion] surrounded by a broad walk with trees &
shrubs at each side and wh is the chief promenade of the towns
people & strangers and as I told you before a great place for the nurses
and children - but in both Dresden & Leipic there is too much of English
to please me - I do not mean English people for at this season there
are very few but the appearance of the people is too English to give
them the charm of novelty - we met very few could speak English
Bessie gets on very well & has never failed to make herself understood
We slept at Mr Evans lodging also - it was managed so by putting the
Gentlemen in one room & the ladies in another and we prefered it
to going to Hotel - we next morning (Tuesday) that is all except Mr Evans
started at seven oclock for Altenburgh a town one hours distance
by railway from Leipsic - it is a curious place and more foreign
than either Dresden or Leipsic but much smaller; the dress
of the women is very curious I got some little prints - that will
give you a better idea of them than I could but you must wait
until we go home for them - We breakfasted at the first Hotel
we met not one of the first [insertion]in rank[/insertion] I believe but one very good & clean
we [insertion]at our breakfast[/insertion] had a dish of excellent Beefsteaks a whole dozen of Eggs, Coffee,
and bread & butter in plenty for 1s/ 2 1/2d [insertion]of our money[/insertion] for each person - this we
had in the "Stube" as it is called, the public eating room but
had our table to ourselves - as we happened to be the first there.
other parties came in afterwards and sat at other tables - this
is optional always I believe - but generally at dinner there is
one long table prepared for dinner with all the necessary appurtenances
on it but you may order what food you like yourself and
are charged accordingly - then round the rooms are small tables
that those wishing only for Coffee or Beer & Cigars can sit if they prefer
it - [deletion]but[/deletion] Ladies [insertion]can[/insertion] [deletion]and[/deletion] go into any of those places even by themselves
and are neither remarked nor annoyed by doing so - indeed the
smoking is the only disagreeable part about it & that I am not
yet reconciled to, [insertion]nor[/insertion] never could I think - even here on the continent
there are many places in which it is forbidden - When done
breakfast we went through the town and up to the Castle
it is a curious place and inhabited by a prince or Duke or something
bearing the name of the town - there were visitors in it so
that we could not see the whole interior but were in parts of it
which are very spendid - & not in the style of our country
everything is settled and nice but the rooms have a bare appearance
from the want of Carpets and besides there is very little furniture

in comparison to what is in the general[deletion]l[/deletion]ity of English or Irish
noblemens houses - nor is it scattered [deletion]th[/deletion] about the rooms in the
same way - We Left Altenburgh by the one oclock train
for Leipsic walked about the latter town with Mr E for a while
went to our lodging packed up our things and then went to
the "restauration" to dinner just in time to be ready to start
by the five oclock train for Dresden - we left Mr Evans behind
but he is to be here today with the Model which is to be exhibited
here now for a while - we had [underline]tea[/underline] last night on our arrival wh.
we all enjoyed and got to bed in pretty good time - I was very
tired (none of the others complained at all) but a good nights
rest in [deletion]a[/deletion] comfortable beds did us all good - Mary went off to
breakfast with James & both returned here afterwards - and we
sat & chatted for awhile - James went away - Thos. is in the
girls rooms talking on business matters and I am in my own
room writing this and waiting for the dressmaker - it is really
too hot to go walk about and we dine so early that we have
not much time before dinner for any thing - as this Hotel
is out of the town or in the outskirts, so that it takes time to get
back & forward - but we prefer being here in the good air to
[insertion]being in[/insertion] the town at a higher Hotel - indeed I think every thing here
is very comfortable and clean too & I neither saw Bugs nor
[underline]fleas[/underline] since I came to the continent - I think I saw one flea
and felt it & that is all - we saw Snow many feet deep
yesterday and yesterday morng going to Altenburgh the
ground was so white with frost that you would think
there had been a shower of snow - and in the park at Leipsic
the ponds were still so frozen as to allow the boys to play
& walk on them - today there is no wind at all & the Sun is
as powerful as with us in the hottest Summers - there
are no Gardens to be seen yet in Altenburg we saw them
making one - every think seemed to have been preserved
from the frost elsewhere and was bringing out and a planting
now when the weather is fine - there are plenty of flowers
to be seen in the Markets & streets for sale - made up in bouquets
and wreaths - I bought a wreath of Violets & Myrtle for 6d- & have it here in my
room
