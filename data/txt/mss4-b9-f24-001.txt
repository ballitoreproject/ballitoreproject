Spencerville 13th day of the 6th month 1850 -
Dear Cousin Sarah and [underline]beloved Christian friend[/underline], for such seems
to be the true title wherewith I seem entitled to address thee, not only
from the general spirit of thy communication now before me, but
more particularly from its closing prayer. "That my last days may
be better than my first" Truly this is in a fair way of being fulfilled
through the Grace and abundant Mercy of my Heavenly Father, who
when I was left desolate and alone by earthly parents and friends
kept close to me even as [underline]Life[/underline] itself, how wonderful indeed are the
ways, - unsearchable and past finding out - are those of our God
well may [underline]I[/underline], as an Individual exclaim. - "What is man that thou
art mindful of him, and the son of Man that thou visitest him"
being, young, foolish and unthinking when I left Ireland in 1833
I have but a faint remembrance of thee, if thou art the person I surmise
thou art. - Alexander's Barrington's Sister who lived with Sml. Gamble, this
matters not however, if, we were not akin in the flesh. I feel I am
closely related to thee and all those who love God, and endeavour to
follow the example of his dear Son Jesus Christ - it is a matter of most
wonderful surprise to me, that neglecting as I did in Youth the teachings
of God's holy spirit and the good instructions I received from those among
whom I lived both by example and precept, that ever I have been brought
to the saving Knowledge of the Truth as it is in Christ Jesus, amazing that
now when my heart was hardened in Sin, and my head almost white
with the snow flakes of Grief not Age that, [underline]that[/underline] heart should be softened
that proud head bowed down beneath the conviction, that I should
die and be for ever lost! unless a recompence were made for my guilt,
oh! how precious to be enabled to believe that, [underline]that[/underline] recompence is made
and that too by [underline]Jesus Christ[/underline], the [underline]Son of God[/underline], for [underline]poor, poor, lost, lost me[/underline],
how transcendant that Mercy, that vouchsafes to ransom the erring due
and [underline]gives assurance that all will yet be well[/underline] - Praise be to the name
of our God who through his Son hath openessed up an highway, whereby
all [underline]who will, some, may come[/underline], and find [underline]Everlasting life[/underline], sharing
freely in all the good and precious gifts which he has in store for all
those that [underline]Love[/underline] and [underline]serve him[/underline] - may I not looking to those things
that are behind, be enabled to press forward to the mark of my high
calling which is in Christ Jesus, - , believing that this only is the sure

way of Life and that thus only is the only hope of being fullfilled the
spirit of thy kind wish - for this end May God grant me grace, and may
every child of God who hath an interest at the throne of Mercy bear me
up in the tender confiding arms of undoubting Faith and Prayer -
It would reach beyond the limits of this sheet to recount the wondrous
ways of God in bringing to a knowledge of his lost condition, one of the
most sinful and unregenerate of mankind, not that I am unwilling
to lay before thee the history of my Life (at some other time I may do
so if thou wishes) for I am ever ready
but for the present suffice it to say - That it was through the spirit of
contradiction that I was first led into the Knowledge of the Truth, if, indeed
[underline]I[/underline] may be said to have attained thereto, who am only as it were a new
born babe to anything that is good - it was thus, a certain class of people
have been abroad in the land this some time back, but more especially
since 1843. I had heard and read of them, but never met with any
till between 3 or 4 years since, they preach the speedy fulfilment of Christ's
promise "I will come again" and have shewn pretty clearly to the minds
of many in these lands, and to mine among the rest, through the fulfilment
of Daniel's prophecies regarding the 4 Kingdoms, in connection with the
Revelations of John the "Divine" that the Second Advent of Jesus Christ is
nigh even at the Doors as our Saviour said himself in the 24th of Matthew
"when ye see these things begin to come to pass, know that it is nigh &c
in a deep rooted belief that man [underline]should never, was never[/underline] to know anything
about it. I laughed them to scorn, notwithstanding, many [underline]able[/underline], and
[underline]learned[/underline] men came out to meet them, men as it were deeply and
throughly versed in all the Knowledge of the "Egyptians" who could reason
in any language, nay almost to use a hyperbole could all but solve the
mystery of their own existence, were by there unpretending believers in
God's holy word, men without scholastic knowledge of any kind, without
any other aid but the plain words of the Bible - foiled at every point, no
weapon, no device they could raise, prospered - , and they have invariably
returned from the field of controversy throughly beaten into Silence, or have
acknowledged their error, and come out boldly advocating the cause, they
once sought to overthrow, such in some degree was my case, urged on by others
And long to tell to all around
What Jesus done for me -

who openly proffessed to "Love the Lord" yet hated to hear of his coming, and
fearful to enter to contest lest they should lose the good opinion of this world
they persuaded me, nothing loath however to do battle for them, my perfect
Knowledge of this worlds history with a considerable smattering of its Geological
Structure with a total ignorance of anything contained in the Bible, I deemed
sufficient armour to meet them, inasmuch as I was beyond the power of
prejudice - how much I was mistaken the event has proved, the very Knowledge
I possessed of this worlds history and progress, but made more plainly evident
to my mind the fulfilment of the greatest part, at least of Gods prophetic word
seeing these things were so, and not daring to believe otherwise than that the Great
Judge of all flesh, was nigh even at the door, I ceased to cavil with or about others
and was led into a searching of [underline]myself[/underline] what I there behold, or how I felt
on seeing my situation, none can know or understand unless they had
been equally wicked with myself - then was the cry raised within me
day and night "what shall I do - what can I do to be saved? without
a single earthly being to direct, nor none to comfort, I knew not whence
to turn, or whither flee surrounded by [underline]high professing[/underline] Christians of
[underline]every denomination[/underline], loud in the praise of God and giving glory to his
name, yet devoid of every particle of Charity or Love to one another, backbiting
and slandering all who did not worship as they did, praying to God
to-day and declaring with tongues vociferous, how dearly they loved the Blessed
Jesus, as they prayed "Thy Kingdom come" To-morrow so abhorrent was
Jesus Christ to them, that "Infidel" Blasphemer" was the softest word they
could bestow upon their fellow man, who would endeavour thro' the Bible to
shun the Second Advent nigh at hand, open [underline]professing[/underline]; they had not a
spark of the [underline]possession[/underline] of true love to God - bad and wicked as I had been
and knowing too how deeply amenable I was to God's just, indignation and
wrath, I felt as though I could almost welcome his coming, if it were only
to put an end to present misery by taking me from myself, in what it mattered
not, so that I was changed from my present condition, relief however came
in God's own time, by constant and unremitting study of the Bible, I trust
I have been led into the right way, I have at least attained within reach of the
"Cross" and if I perish, I shall perish then. I am willing to rest all, and
risk all upon the Blessed Redeemer of mankind, Him, who has said -
"Whosoever cometh unto me I will in no-wise cast out" He is my
Hope, my strength, my consolation, even Jesus Christ, who is alone the sure
Mediator for all men, he is [underline]my Saviour, My Atonement[/underline] and [underline]my God[/underline].

Unto thee oh! Lord I am willing to resign all, fashion as thou wilt, do as thou wilt, only
save my Soul - give me my Soul for a prey - this is all my desire -
I give thee all I can no more
Tho' poor my offering be -
A contrite heart, is all the store
That I can bring to thee -
Then take it Lord this proffered heart
And make it wholly thine
Cleanse it throughout, nor leave a part
Untouched by power Divine!
-
I know thou caust my bruises heal
Each guilty stain remove
Oh! give me then more ardent Zeal
To meet meet thine holy Love!
To meet thine holy Love!
Great is the Mercy, here below
Abundant - is thy Grace
Else why should I, those hungerings know
And Thirstings after peace?
-
Do thou sustain me while I bow
And full surrender make
Of all that I possess - e'en now
Receive for Jesus sake! -
Grant me thy Counsel and thy light
To rule my soul in Fear -
A faithful watch by Day or Night -
To keep - till Christ appear! -
-
Then when thine own Almighty plan
Redemption - is complete
And I have measured out my span
Before the Mercy-seat -
May I find Grace at thy right hand
And of thy Joys partake -
With the Redeemed of every land -
All for - Dear Jesus' sake! -
Thou will I trust forgive this lapse into Poetry, I can ever express my thoughts
best in such language especially when I feel deeply, and my heart is full, as
it at the present time - On looking over this paper, I find I have
been led into greater length than I intended, however I hope it will
be none the less welcome since its worst feature if bad it [underline]dare[/underline] be called
which is but rehearsing the great mercies of a kind God over all -
I will now recur to thy letter. Thou wishes to know something as regards
my family - to proceed, I have six sons to begin with 12. 10. 8. 6. 4.
2. years respectively John Chamberlain the eldest, Manliff Barrington,
Thomas Arthur, Clarence Sydney, Frederic Willliam, Samuel Alexander -
I do not pretend to farm any of late, tis true I have a garden of
near two acres of ground with a house such as it is, wherein, and on
which I live, it belongs to an Individual whose children I once
had the pleasure of teaching, and who has since remained my steady
friend. I have has my family residing here those 4 years, free of
Rent charge or any demand whatever, and have the liberty of remaining
on the same terms, as long as I please, or as he quaintly expressed
himself "as long as you behave yourself" and dont become "Mad
Wright" again - This latter Soubriquet is the name I have borne for
many years till of late almost over the whole province of Canada West,
I once owned a splendid farm of 50 acres, for which I gave £100, and on
