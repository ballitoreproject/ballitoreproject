John Richardson's Sight.
As I was riding alon[deletion]g[/deletion]e in an Evening (but not in the
Dark) upon a large Common, in the East part of Yorkshire
not far from North-Cave, near 48 house; ( for the Court for 48
towns & Villages to meet at;) a little before I came at it; I heard
an horse coming after me, dashing in the water (it having
rained lately), which came close by me on my left side, so
near that I could have laid my hand on his shoulder: the
horse was all over milk-white with a long tail, a bridle on
his head, a man upon his back with the bridle in his hand
& a pair of mittens on, black & white wool mixed: his coat
the same colour, & a mountier-cap buttoned round his chin,
Gamashes buttoned round his Legs; he was like a great-boned
robust man, with a dark countenance & roman nose: when
he came by me he t[insertion]h[/insertion]rew my left leg over my horse's back, but
being nimble & by the help of Providence, I recovered myself
from falling: & as we came close up to the aforesaid house the
man & horse turned into a very great flame of fire, such an
one as I never saw & po[deletion]w[/deletion][insertion]u[/insertion]red in at a great oak window frame
into the house: [insertion]after which I heard such a great thunder in the house[/insertion] that I did think it must fall; & the earth
seemed to shake under me, which surprised me so much
that I thought I shou'd have lost my hat by the rising of
my

my hair; but I had courage & strength to put it on again. I
believe this was suffered for a trial of my faith; & I think
the enemy would have destroyed me at that time, if
he had been suffered: but the Lord was pleased to disappoint
him & preserve me. I was then about 16 years of
age. JR.
