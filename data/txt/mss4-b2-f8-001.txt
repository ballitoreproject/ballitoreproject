Ballitore 9/7 month 1763
Dear sister,

	We received a letter from mother & another from thee, both together by post, & I wrote to mother in answer under a cover directed to Anne Poole, which I met with an opportunity of sending to Carlow, & hope it got to hand. Lest it may have miscarried, I now inform that it contained inclosed a letter from Han: Barcroft to mother, desiring the payment of a years rent. If mother gives me directions & lets me know how much it is, I can order her payment I believe soon in Dublin.
	We are in general pretty much our usual here. Betty complains at times of her head & leg, but gets about. E Boake [?] has been keeping his bed with his old pain in his breast some days past. Sally Bridge, nor the other woman from Roscrea, not yet returned. Dont expect us a third day night at Castleton; for our going there is very uncertain. We have got the still bespoke in Dublin from A: Johnson & have some expectation of getting it home next week.
	I hope ye will not let cousin Jo forget that he owed us a visit here, perhaps he will come with you, when ye return  which I supposed will be before winter  I met Sarah in the street to day, & saw the house yesterday: it is there still  I have got sand drawn to mix with lime for the pointing of it. I Have yet taken no meadow, am thinking of buying the hay: am cutting my own meadow, but it is very brittle weather to make the hay. I think with one trouble or another I could hardly bear to live contentedly in the world, but for the comfortable, agreeable, strengthening, reliv- [paper torn and creased] that I have. Irelands mo- [paper torn] morning on her way to Dublin: she is a [paper torn] the mistress says: but has poor health

[note margin p. 1]
Our dear love is to you all. How do Peggy & Molly behave themselves? Sally & George are good children now; for I whipt Sally yesterday: for which [paper creased] from her mother, as if I did not know how to do it with propriety, tho it belongs to my trade. Debby has been pretty well since. I am, dear Deborah, thy affectionate brother Rich Shackleton.
P.S. No further account of Larry yet  coats [?] come but slowly.

Dear sister,

	I suppose Samuel Ely called & let you know that we got safe & well home: by my discourse with him I gather that he is not out of hopes of his affair succeeding. I cannot say we found all well at home; for several of the boys have ugly coughs, Charley Robisen [sic] complained of a pain in his side: it looked something like a pleurisy. Israel Read (that my wife was dreaming about when there) had been very bad with the tooth-ache, & got a tooth drawn in our absence by Michael Murry; seemed as if he had taken cold afterwards, & was very ill. So that we found ourselves much wanted at home. Aby but indifferent still. I have not seen him yet. Molly Haughton very indifferent, seems very hysterical. However; Betty had a fine nights rest of it last night, is tolerably well; & the family I think in general better this morning  Betty dreamed last night (she says) that our dear sweet Molly was dead. We send the bearer on purpose to know how our dear lamb is. I pray God if it be his will (who knows best what is best) to spare her to us. Besure [sic] let some body write us a circumstantial account how she is, as well as a verbal message by the bearer, who takes Peggys shoes, a night-shift & check: apron. Betty bids me write that she would have the night-shift thoroughly warmed, &c. by Peggys wearing it, or otherwise before Molly puts it on, if Molly be yet alive: but this caution I am sure is quite unnecessary to thee: but I must obey orders.
	Betty seems greatly concerned about thee, & no wonder. Besure be particularly in letting us know how mother & thou are, & take all possible care of yourselves. We will take what care we can of every thing here belonging to you: & well we may; for ye have trouble enough, as well as ^our^ other kind friends there, with our poor, dear, sweet child.
	Sally Bridge came last fourth day, says the widow Freeman is preparing to come.
	Our dear love is to you all. I long for, & yet fear to hear the news which the bearer will bring back. May we all learn patience & resignation; for we have need of that lesson in this troublesome, uncertain world.
	I am, dear debby [sic], for all thy tenderness, care & trouble, thy much obliged &
		truly affectionate brother
			Rich Shackleton.
P.S.
I heard from Tommy Carleton: his father received the rent from Aleler [?].
