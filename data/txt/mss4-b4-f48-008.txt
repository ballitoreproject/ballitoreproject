Dublin: 23/10 mo:1807.
My dear Betsy,
I take the advantage of a good pen & ink at John Toterton's
to scribble a little to thee which I wait for Betsy Barrington. There are
goodnatured, unaffected people & as such have their graces - I do like such
people & such company better than the stiff or sentimental, & I would not lose
their company by writing only that Betsy & Tommy Bewley are settling
accounts, & we must not talk. Do, my dear, send by Dennis a basket for the
Tin ware next time he comes - tho' I hope I shall be at home before then. But
a new perplexity befel us to day - the hired corrector took offence at the Coun
[unclear]r's[/unclear] corrections, & said if it was not his way, he would have nothing
do with it, & would not look at the next sheet at all, nor confer
with the counsellor, & wrote a note to Isaac intimating that he (Isaac) was
stupid & Keene the Bookseller said if Phillips the correcter was not employed
he would have nothing to do with it, & he wished to see Robt. Fayle, so to Robert
I went, & the kind creature went to Keene, & I hope has thro' him pacified the
[unclear]conectn[/unclear]
24th It is a bright, but I fear a fallacious morning however no weather confines me
about O. I intend visiting Isaac, & then going to breakfast as Saml Doyle's. E Barrington
told me about thy Aunt Sally's watch. I got a new spring & paid 0:1 1/2, I desired both Eben
& Wm to take it, but they forgot, & I think I will not sent it by Betsy. Though Thos. Johnson
& I concluded that as it had been repaired she might as well wear it longer as he would
give as much for it on a future day as now - he says it is not with as much as mine,
for the maker was not a good one - tho [unclear]cipher[/unclear] is against it - the hunting watches are
rather high, especially those with the little dial - & we think when she comes herself &
looks & considers would be the best time. O how I regret she did not get the repeater he
had when I was here last, it was a great bargain. If he could meet with me for her that
would be the thing I think. But if she choses to have it changed now I will do my best
for her, & I believe so will Thomas, so I think I may as well keep it till I go myself &

in the mean time they watch & regulate the movement. I admire the attentive in
dealing of Thos & his sons, especially Frank. This is an exemplary family - but E: Johnson
is the gem of it indeed! My dear Betsy, need I say how I long to return? Often when dear
Jane & her cousin retire after tucking me in [insertion]at night[/insertion] almost always, my heart beats or palpitates &
is in discouraging thoughts - but I strive against them - & I wish to "number my blessings"
Ah how could thou [deletion]say[/deletion] speak of troubling me with commissions I would rather have them
than not &any I keep to myself I do som but those I delegate are delayed In the backs
of [unclear]dregs[/unclear] are ill Magneria for Sarah Middleton -Grim & alas for myself[unclear] is Jalap for[/unclear]
M Webster - She sent for by dear White - The basket is mine.

The morning having turned to rain, disappoints our breakfasting out - this happens
Farewell [unclear]dearly[/unclear]
so often that I cease to regret it. A walk even on clean flags would be exhilarating, for
that I get so seldom that I don't expect it, & all my schemes of pleasure point homeward.
Wm. has received a letter from Saml. Doyle I suppose. Saml. accepted the bills for the
paper, & I wrote a note to M. Donnel to desire him to call upon him for them
No money from M. Manus yet, consequently none has been given Keene. I was with
Issac this morning - the 13th book is a great puzzle to us who don't understand latin
as neither the Printer, his devils nor I do, yet I could assist them & his is oft better than [deletion][/deletion][insertion]any[/insertion]
[deletion]of[/deletion] them. The Counsellor, gentleman as he is, gives up his judgement to the Correcter - the
[underline]Devil seems very cross, in a Luciferean spirit - the other Devil appears good humoured[/underline]
Jane Duras was to have accompanied me & Hannah would not expect us if it was [unclear][/unclear]
