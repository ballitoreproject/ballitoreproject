Ballitore: 18/10 month 1781

My dear friend,

	Thy last, though the dregs after filling out to thy sister and my daughter, was acceptable to me - the sweet sometimes stays at the bottom. I treat thee differently, for having to make some sort of reply to several of my correspondents in and about London, I begin with thee. I think it best to make use of opportunity when it is in my power - so many interruptions come, that procrastination is dangerous. - Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thy ^thine^ hand to do it. Here is good instruction, both as to when and how, both as to time and manner. [pencil note] X [end note] I find by thine Mary Brooke paid her visit - I make not doubt but each of you was disappointed - She thought to view thee on one side, & probably it was the other side which was presented to her - Thou perhaps hoped that thy state would be ministered to by a deep, experienced minister, doubts solved, and advice imparted: but probably the burden of the word given to her might not have much in it for thee - the Priest and the Levite may be permitted to pass by on the other side, and the stripped and wounded and half-dead be little the better for them - Moses and Elias disappeared, and they saw no man any more, save [page number] 230 Jesus only with themselves: and the voice from the excellent glory was, This is my beloved Son, hear him. Thus it pleaseth Infinite Wisdom to deal with those, whom he wants to bring and to settle more immediately and more steadily under his own teaching - he [word crossed out] ^manifests^ to them their own great helplessness, that they may seek unto him for help; he makes them sensible of their own foolishness, that they may apply ^un^to him for instruction, and he shuts up instrumental means of supply, that he, the great, inexhaustible source of all Good may be waited & depended alone upon +++
	Edith Lovell, from Bristol was at our Quarterly meeting at Edenderry - she did not appear in the publick meetings of worship - her concern seems mostly to the families within the precincts of the meeting of Dublin, to which meeting her certificate is principally addressed, and I believe she does not expect to proceed much farther in the nation - She is a sweet minister, not large in her gift - [pencil note] XX [end note] She & thy aunt Pike & Thomas Bewley came to us from Dublin 10th instant, were at our meeting next day - After dinner I accompanied them to Baltiboys-side, & we visited every family belonging to that place - We parted 13th in the forenoon, they returned to Dublin, and I home, very well pleased with my little excursion - These seasons are often the means of confirming old amities, and forming new and valuable connexions.
