Mary Leadbeater
Ballitore
Dear Friend
It affords me pleasure
to introduce to thy acquaintance, John
Griscom, one of the most respectable Friends
in this City, who is now on the point
of departing for Europe. - Should our
"Emerald Isle" claim any portion of
his time, I trust he will not slightly
pass by a place possessing so many attractions
to a man of Literature, as Ballitore,
& in the event of his visiting it,
I need hardly say, that all the attention
he receives there, will confer an
obligation on
thy sincere friend
