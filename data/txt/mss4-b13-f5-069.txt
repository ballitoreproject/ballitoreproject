Sarah Talbot died 7th.. of 11th.. month 1821.
Gone, happy spirit, to those regions gone,
Where pain, temptation, sorrow, are unknown,
Thy pilgrimage is past, thy trials o'er,
Let not the Good, the Wise, thy loss deplore,
Thou art not lost, but only gone before.
Then mourn not, dearest sister, though thy mind
Patient, reverts to scenes long left behind,
your arduous travel through Britainnia's land,
your spirits joined in friendship's holy land,
your trials, toils, your fears and dangers past,
In hope to meet rewarding Peace at last,
your parting pangs, your letters which o'erfloed
With the pure love which in your bosoms glowed,
sweet solace this - till the dear light of day,
From thy sad eyes, my sister, passed away.
