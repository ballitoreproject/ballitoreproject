a picture of the Duke
of Wellington and his
daughter on the field
of Waterloo at Cranfield's -
then parting at Euston
street, Josephine and
I came home just in
time for dinner.
Papa came in from
Fassaroe and brought
me in a fine long
letter from Polly.
For a wonder we spent
a pleasant evening
here at home, Papa
read us some articles
out of the news papers.
Must gang to bed -.
Oh! we met Sam Murray
in the exhibition yesterday.
