25/5 month 1780.

My dear Molly,
	I took the liberty to open a packet sent for thee by C Angrew [?]it seemed necessary that I should do so in order to send it properly to thee under franksmy honourable friend (under whose roof I am) will I expect send the whole packet free to thee under two covers.
	Having written pretty copiously to thy mother herewith, & having more writing to get done, I must beg leave to cut this short, & to refer thee to my letter to her. I was concerned to have cause to apprehend that both thy mother & thou had been poorly since I parted youI was considerably uneasy for a time, but matters were worse than represented to me; but Abys mentioning your intention for Clonmel alleviated my fears.
	Farewell, my dear child: with all thy acquisitions of knowledge, above all, earnestly seek to know God, & his Son Jesus Christ, whom he has sent, & is sending into the hearts of many beloved youth here & elsewhere, in order for their preservation, sanctification & redemption. I trust thou wilt not be the hindmost in this most noble aspiration after the highest thing, nor suffer thyself to be overcome by the adversary of all Good in a glorious contention & struggle against him for that life & immortality which is brought by the Gospel of Christ. Farewell again, my beloved MollyI hope to see thy dear face with joy
	Richard Shackleton
