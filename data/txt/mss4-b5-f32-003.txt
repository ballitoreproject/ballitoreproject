TO THE
Memory
OF
John Grubb Clibborn
who died at
Annermills
in the seventh year of his age
How sweet the primrose in the peaceful shade,
Though on its slender stem the petals lie,
All chilled and faded by the piercing gale
That bids its vernal bloom too quickly die.
Like thee lov'd boy so late a beateous flower
Whose form expanded to affection's eyes;
The earliest grace of thy paternal bower,
Transplanted now to more congenial skies.

Though early, called from life's delusive maze
Thy mind had bend to wisdoms safe cotehoul
For innocence to thee was length of days.
And faith and hope pofessed thy infant soul.
Thy lisping tongue this genuine truth did give,
Nor has experience one more, wisely given
That it is better far to die than live
For pain has no admittance into heaven.
Ye much loved parents who surveyed the scene
Though natures tears on soaring hope may rise,
And though the clouds of time may intervene
Behold your darling passed into the skies.
Note. Alluding to his expression. Providence is very good
he will forgive me as he does other people.

My dear friend I really fear from my silence that you will conceive that
I am void of gratitudes which I trust is not the case. I finished a letter
yesterday to my dear boy, requesting that he would forward it to thee
just to relieve thy anxious mind respecting our journey- for I did
not seem equal to encounter letter writing which at all times is extreme
to me because right qualification is wanting - not from a deficiency
of the talents recieved from him who delivered this blessings bountifully
to his poor finite man - but by not occupying with the Talents users
as we become [unclear]dawrss[/unclear] - and consequently in much danger of the awful
sentance pronounced by our Redeemer - the parable of the stewards has often offered
to me as being just as well as awfully solemn -- My dear friend I had not a thought
of this dificiency when I took up the pen & in order to obtain quietude come
& sit with my mother. but conversation and other interruptions - perplexes me
My head being more poorly since my return - than whilst with you. I have lost
my sight many times whilst writing these few lines. & but for laziness would take
a glass of wine which in general clears my head almost immediately
I refined bruised Columbo in a tea pot. intending to take it with elixir
vitriol. now the bells has rung for tee & the port men will call before
I have said half what is in my heart. & love being the principle theme deserves [insertion]the first place[/insertion]
my not paying a farewell to my esteemed friend thy sister Shackleton affords
continued regre... & have spent more time with her wou'ld have afforded
me much [unclear]gratification[/unclear] - & her honest worthy son Richard's company
was truly grateful. I hope yet to get acquainted with George. whose adornment
in the right I have hopes of - how much good one dedicated faithful follower
or of a [underline]crucified Lord[/underline] may do - & particularly when the hearts of those
wound them are open and warm and careful not by word or deed
to wound the tender mind. I hope my friend Betsy her comforted
you all by her description of the great solemnity : E Watson
undertook to tell thee of us so far as her house.
I am on the whole much better. took a ride with my
mother Joseph & little James in her chaise to day
I find [unclear]puat[/unclear] seesaw of head & hand work. My precious
Sara is [unclear]nuised[/unclear] in almost every thing
do not be offended of my paying the postage often
worthless - had I kept it & filled it - I should not
be scrupulous the man with my dear Lucy did do
Letter me of her & believe me thy ever sincere E. Co

I should like to be remembered to the Bonham family
in dear love to each of my very kind friend farewell
