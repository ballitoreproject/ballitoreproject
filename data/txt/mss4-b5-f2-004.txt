Cork 17th of 3d month 1796
My dear friend
Thy acceptable letter of 9th. inst came duly to hand, and
tho' it does not require a reply, I am induced again to salute thee, by having since
recd an unexpected gratification from our mutually beloved friend Deba: Darby,
of which I think to send an extract - She writes from New York 26th of 1mo. 1796,
& after some lies respecting myself says - "When I last wrote my beloved friend
" C P we were entered on a visit to the families in Philadelphia & in a meeting,
"300 in number, but after sitting thro' nearly half, we found it necessary (for the
"sake of health) to go a little into the [unclear]Jerseys[/unclear], to take some meetings we had not visited
"& finding our minds drawn to attend a quarterly meeting on Long Island, held this
"week, we are now in the City on our way, expecting in a few weeks to return to Phlaa:
"& go on with the family visit: and according to present prospect, we may be ready
"to depart from this land by the latter end of the 4th, or early in the 5th month -
"It is a pleasing circumstance that we are likely to have the company of our beloved
"friends Samuel Emler & Willm.. Savory, who are preparing to pay a religious
"visit to some parts of Europe - Germany & the south of France is particularly in
"Willm.. Savoy's view - A woman friend, her name Charity Cook, from south
"Carolina, is also expected in Philad.. on her way to England, Thus the great Lord
"of the harvest is caring for his heritage & sending forth faithful labourers - you
"have been abundantly favoured in this way - May he that can alone add the
"blessing, regard you & turn the voice of mourning into thanksgiving, if consistent
"ent "with his blessed will! x x x . This will also inform our dear friends
at

"at Anner Mills, Ballitore, & dear M Watson, where & how we are: to them
"all we wish to have our dear love conveyed" - Deborah desires the salutation
of dear love to M. Ridgway & J. Watson, which I request thou wilt have
communicated, with like remembrance from me: It may be done without
showing this letter for I suppose a principal part of the intelligence will not
be new to May & Jane or to you - I am obliged by thy information about
Willm.. Crotch, Richd.. Jacob &c - I have not yet heard of Tho.. Scattergood
& John Abbell's leaving Waterford, but expect they will attend your insuing
quarterly meetings. -
Please to mention me affectionately to thy [unclear]W:L[/unclear]. thy Mother
& Sally. Abram & Lydia &c. I am, dear Mary, thine sincerely
James Abell
