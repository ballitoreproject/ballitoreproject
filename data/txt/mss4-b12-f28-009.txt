Lugano 21st August 1854
Hotel du Lac
My dearest Mama & Papa
When we posted our last
home on the 10th. inst. in Carlsruhe, the
day was so hot we went to the Botanic
Gardens & sat in the shade talking
for two or three hours - & then to the Picture
Gallery - the 11th we left Carlsruhe for Baden
-Baden - a most delightful place - we
walked to the top of one of the hills there
to see an old castle from the top
of wh. is a most splendid view -
Baden Baden is a dear place - at
present almost full - with the English
Mineral Waters there - The spring
[deletion][/deletion] was so hot we could not keep
our hands long in it - We left it at
7-5 by sail for Offenburg - there we
slept & went on next morning to
Frieburg - from thence to Hollsteig
[underline]in[/underline] the Black Forest by Omnibus where
we slept - The following morning [deletion]we[/deletion]
as there was no room in the "Poste"
we got one of the country [insertion](waggons) or[/insertion] carts
something like this shape [drawing] with 4
horses to take us on to Schaffhausen
that was a most delightful drive

through the Black Forest - we changed
horses 3 times at Lengkirch, Bonndorf
and Stuhlingen - [deletion][/deletion]
[insertion]The[/insertion] drive [insertion]was hilly[/insertion] & though it was a slow way
of travelling it was very pleasant
we came over one hill the top of wh. was
400 ft higher than the top of [underline]Slieve Donard[/underline].
We took that route instead of going to
Bale - it was a much better plan, as
it saves us going to Bale [underline]twice[/underline] -
from those high hills we passed
we saw the high mountains of
Switzerland, [insertion]the tops of wh. are[/insertion] [underline]covered with snow[/underline] -
We left Schaffhausen on the 14th
in a carriage for Zurich - then
by Steamer on Lake Zurich to
Rapperswijl -- could not go to
Lachen as Uncle Richd recommended -
the Steamer went no farther that
night - so instead of going to Lachen
we took a carriage the next morning
from Rapperswijl to Brunnen
on Lake Lucern - We crossed lake
Zurich on the longest bridge in
Europe - it was 4800 feet or 3/4 mile
long we took 16 minutes to cross
it horse's walk - then came
over the mountains of Brunnen.
It was a very wet day & we were
very sorry as the scenery was beautiful
We were very much pleased with
[deletion]Switz[/deletion] Schwitz wh Uncle Richd says is
"Lovely lovely" - but we all liked
Brunnen better The lake[deletion]s[/deletion] and
the mountains there are splendid
We left Brunnen on the 16th sailed down
lake Lucern to Fluelen where we hired
a carriage to Hospenthal passing through
Altof - the morning was fine - but while
we were resting & feeding the horses at
Amsteg very heavy rain came accompanied
with thunder. - Towards evening
the rain ceased & we could get out to
look at the Devils bridge.
We had a different climate in Hospenthal
it is 1500 ft higher than the top of
Lugnaquilla - On Thursday 17th 6 of us
(leaving Mrs Crawford in Hospenthal)
went to the Furka - Uncle walked
all the way, the rest of us rode 4 1/2 hours
[underline]up[/underline] the mountains. Such a ride
I never had - When we got to the top
of the Furka where there is a hotel
we were 3540 feet higher than
Hospenthal - we put on warm clothing

before going up I had I think more
on me than I wd in the winter at
home - On arriving there we lunched
then off with us again for 3 or 4 hours
walk higher up on the mountain
to look at the Glacier de Rhone which
was well worth going to see. -
[deletion][/deletion] such a lonely place I never
was in - Not a tree not a bird no
noise but that of the water from
the Glacier. We saw cows - they were
so far off they were like birds - they
looked so small; we saw several
[underline]small[/underline] houses [insertion]in[/insertion] wh, our guide told us,
they made the cheese - they were not
better than a Pigsty in Ireland.
After dinner & tea [insertion]of[/insertion] wh we made one meal
we went to bed (about 7 30) - intending
next morning to get up at 5 & go back
to Hospenthal - 5 oclock came & with
it a regular winters morning Snow 4 inches
deep on the ground & snowing still -
The storm did not cease[deletion]d[/deletion] till 1 30 that
day - We did not get up till 10 breakfast[unclear]ed[/unclear]
at 11 - & left it at 2-30 - got back to
Hospenthal at 6.30 - We left Hospenthal
on the 19th for this arrived here at 7 PM
on the 20th Sleeping one night on the road
at Faido - going over Mt St Gottard & from
Airolo to Faido was the nicest part of our
drive - - we have got hot summer again like the
weather we had in Carlsruhe[deletion][/deletion] -
