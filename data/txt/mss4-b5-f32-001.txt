Auner Mills 1st day 21st. of 5.th month 1820
My much loved friend,
I sat down yesterday intending to write thee a long
letter by our niece Jane who is to leave this in the morning for Waterford
on her way homeward, expecting to meet her father in Carlow -- we have
very damp weather which has a relaxing effort on such constitutions
as mine - attempting too much as getting down to early breakfast - going up
and down stairs &c &c. threw me back so that I have not been able for
you several days to bear the [deletion]exertion[/deletion] motion of my mothers carriage, yesterday
my husband mounted me on the little mare. he walked beside me
and a servant led her. about the field. he has not yet procured a
safe horse for the pillion - my little girls importuned me to write
for them for they are never tired of talking about you, but particularly
thy Leydia with whom they seem well acquainted by the questions
continually put to me - Thou may'st judge of Priscilla's futile
imagination. she spoke so fast that I could scarcely write but tho[unclear][/unclear]
 that their innocent prattle would amuse dear Leydia - whose
affectionate attentions I hope ever to remember. be assured
that the childrens acknowledgement came spontaneously from their
own mouths - Pris - is a sweet creature. she is never happy away
from me and is more like my precious Jostine in mind & disposion
than any of the children - Ah! my dear friend - this day
twelve years. my mother had [deletion]her[/deletion] our [underline]five[/underline] blooming children
brought down and fixed in rank for strangers to look at
and admire - short sighted creatures! our lovely John
attended both meetings and was far from blooming before
we retired to bed - my dear mother has never since
taken pleasure in seeing them collected -- my feelings
were much tried last evening in writing for the littles ones
I wish to encourage them to speak & remember their sweet
brother - the nervous pain of face & teeth and the retrospection
of many trying scenes prevented my sleeping 1or2 night
each day brings something new & of the afflicting kind. how
affliction takes its round. a fine youth Thomas David snatched

from his affectionate parents. Deborah Grubb has been poorly since
her return from Dublin. with sickness the natural consequence
of her situation - probably increased by her affliction for her brother
Doctor Burgess was to see her yesterday and left her better - you
have probably heard of R.B's failure - bad news flies fast
he improved a nice farm near this place a man of the
Popish profession has now a great bargain of it - so with
dear James Abell's sweet retreat - Temple-ville --
When I lie musing - and others asleep - you are the most frequent
companion of my thoughts - my heart overflows with
love towards [insertion]you[/insertion] with good desires for each of you a few
nights since I dreamed that I longed so to see you that
my husband took me and that you would hardly receive
me. that I queried of it was because I did not leave a
farewell message for thy Richard. who was so attentive
to me.. and I was told that that was really the cause
now thou see'st that in my sleep I was conscious
of a neglect for which I do hope he will excuse me
& do tell him with my kind remembrance - that I [unclear] coud[/unclear]
he may be a Richard Shackleton _ _
Thy kind letter my beloved friend cheered me this day - to be
remembered by those we love is a balm. I do desire not to
forget the hours spent in thy valued society - a privilege
for which I wish to be grateful -- and hope to continue -
instructed -- surely I was "nursed" and your kindness I
can never repay - thy dear Elizabeth - her attachment to
our darling boy has rendered her increasingly beloved by
me we always enjoyed her company -- 

The poem was written by Mary Chorley and copied by our
niece Jane. I thought it would please thee - our daughter
Jane has made a small [unclear] froymace[/unclear] for thy acceptance
with her own writing on the back. the little ones kept
me so long writing that I [insertion]am[/insertion] now quite limited for time & my
head is very poorly -- 'tho' I am on the whole much better
than in the beginning of last week. & hope to venture in
the carriage tomorrow. my dear love to thy precious
sister Sally - whose nice airy room often revived me
it is pleasant that Mary White [unclear]faced[/unclear]through this
painful dispensation so nicely I hope she will continue
to do well - thy dear sister Chandlee. I often think of -
D. Stephenson read the good old woman's letters in the
schoolroom. Eliza frequently said, "but Deborah these
are friends letters"-- Children are very quick sighted
and I am quite of the mind that their feelings are not
sufficiently attended too- if I were able I should set
about copying a letter received this day from
our precious Sarah - she says that the rash has
disappeared - & that she is quite well - but
full of anxiety about me - poor child - her
feelings are too acute - I have [unclear]but[/unclear] up some
papers which I thought would interest you
those to be returned I have marked - Barclay
I fear is not well or we should have heard in

time from him. I hope that he will send thee
the letter- because I depended on that made of
informing thou respecting many things - now
I am the only person in the house out of bed so
escuse this poor return for thy pretty neat
letter. The three girls have been writing
to their brother, or they should have addressed
some of you - I am sorry that thou didst not
see Sarah's letters to the little ones- farwell
[unclear]Besure[/unclear] present me affectionately to thy husband
& children - M. & A. Doyle - sisters -- and when opportunity
offers. I should that Thomas's wife & assistants
should know that I am grateful for their attentions.
Affectionately O.C.
