A Dream.
Related by George Dellwyn in a publick meeting at
Dublin (1785) which he had some time before the
late American war.
My house being situated on the bank of
a River the water seemed to swell so high as
to overflow till it came to threshold of the Door
& raged with great violence carrying off many
loose things which seemed valuable & thinking
it a pity to lose them I thought I put
forth my hand to keep them by which I was
in danger but withdrawing into the House I
had a sense given me that my business
was to keep within Doors & that nothing

necessary should be taken from me.
This dream he said afforded him [unclear][/unclear]
afterwards much instruction & as he believed
a similar dispensation would shortly take
place in this nation of Ireland he exhorted
all to disentangle themselves to keep separate
from this world & its spirit &
have their minds stayed upon the
Almighty whose presence alone would be
their only support in such a trying
time the approach of which to this
nation he had so clear a prospect of
that he desired it might be noted down
& if came not to pass they might call
him a false prophet. -
