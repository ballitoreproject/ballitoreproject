30 Aungier street 4th month 30th 1818
Dear Sarah
I received thy letter dated the
22nd of 2nd month, & since that I received (I [deletion]believe[/deletion] [insertion]believe[/insertion] all)
the American magazines & numbers of the Friend of Peace
Since thou sent me the magazines, but not before, I read
the biographical memoirs of character of our friend Doctor
[unclear][/unclear] to may [unclear][/unclear] we both admired it very much
Rush to Mary Chandlee, & we both admired it very much.
when Mary Davis returns I hope thou will fulfil thy
from of reading young with her of [unclear][/unclear]to gain my [unclear][/unclear]
promise of reading Young with her, & please to give [deletion]my[/deletion] me
your opinion on [deletion]his[/deletion] [insertion]it[/insertion] - Thy sentiments with respect to
Fenelon exactly coincide with mine, admiration of the man
who acted so precisely according to his principles mixed with
astonishment at his having them. Perhaps [deletion]it is ordered[/deletion]
[deletion]that[/deletion] those great & good men are often permitted to
imbibe the most absurd motions of the various religious
sects in the world that it may induce us to look with
charity & liberality on the religious principles of those which
differ [deletion]to a much[/deletion] from our own. I certainly think that
reading Fenelon's life has a strong tendency to diminish
the dislike that we entertain for the principles of
the [unclear][/unclear]church, yet [unclear][/unclear]we ought to rejoice.
the Romish church, yet still we ought to rejoice & be
thankful at being born [deletion]in[/deletion][insertion]at[/insertion] a brighter day & in a more
favoured part of the globe - I am glad your adult school
that he had been at a Bible Society in Africa, & told us several very
interesting anecdotes of the African Negroes; & read us a beautiful letter
which he lately received from a black convert. He held in his hand a book
which he said was the first ever printed in the New Zealand language. I
think he said that it was himself who invented the written language, & that
before that, it was only oral. As soon as Doctor Orpen was done speaking
I came away (half past 3) to meet my brother James who arrived in the
Limerick coach that evening at 4 o'clock. He lodges at Tobias Pim's. -
We have the please of the company of Anna Forster & Priscilla Young at our
yearly meeting. I think they have very much improved, especially the latter in their
delivery, since their arrival in Ireland - James & I were greatly pleased to
meet here our first cousin Mary Fennell who has never been in Dublin before,
& who came here with Bess Green of Clonmel. - John & Sally Grubb are
at this meeting. The latter still continues to foretell the greatness of our
society, if its members are willing to do their duty. - I had the pleasure
of seeing Lucy Bewby several time; I think her improved in some respects
since she went to school; I wish Lydia had gone with her. - This meeting
has been perplexed with two appeals, the one from the north, which was
rejected on account of being an appeal of some individuals on behalf of others,
which was considered contrary to rule; the other from John Barcroft Haughton,
which is conducted, tho' very unwillingly by his nephew James Haughton is under
the care of a committee. I received Deborah's short letter, which altho' very
acceptable would have been twice as much so, if she had filled a [underline]whole[/underline] sheet.

continues to prosper; it will certainly do so as long as the spirit
of perseverance is kept up, & Eben has plenty of that. His
cold I hope is now so far gone (I mean from him) & the
weather so fine that he & Deborah may ride together. Joseph
Fayle has had several repetitions of cold since he
left Athens; & has been very low spirited; he does not look
so well I think as when he came from you; but I hope
this fine weather & Lydia's society & conversation will combine
to revive his drooping spirits. So you have Betsey home
once more I hear, we were all very much disappointed at
her not coming to the meeting; how is thy aunt Grubb? Tell
Betsey she owes me a letter. - Thou art reading "Goldsmith's
animated Nature" I am told; we may then perhaps shortly
have some epistolary conversation on Natural History, as I
expect shortly to begin the attendance of a course of lectures
on Comparative Anatomy i.e. the anatomy of brute animals.
We have Doctor Orpen in Dublin again at last. I suppose
Lydia showed thee my letter which contained [insertion]an account of[/insertion] my interview
with him; I can hardly say I saw him since, as [insertion]we[/insertion] [deletion]I[/deletion] had
not an opportunity of doing more than nodding to each other
since we met that day. - How dost thou like Edward
Barrington, or did you know each other before? The other
day I had a very agreeable visit of about an hour
from Edward [unclear]Tracy[/unclear], I expect we shall attend the lectures
on botany together this summer which will be very agreeable.
My brother James desired me when I was writing. to send
James & I breakfasted on third-day morning with Edward Alexander in
Linen hall street, where we [deletion]were had[/deletion] enjoyed the company of Betsey Barrington
& Mary White. On third day night I drank tea at John Gough's
in company with my brother James, thy father & two sisters Mary Davis, Betsey
Barrington, Mary White, Joseph Humphreys, George Shackleton Charles Farmer,
Edward Alexander & Edward & Eliza Barrington. - We dined also in company
with a large party of Ballitore friends & others, yesterday at Anna Fayle's. -
Margaret Higland spoke very sweetly (as I suppose she always does) in our
meeting for worship yesterday. - I expect to be very busy to-day, for in a
few minutes I intend going to meeting where I shall probably stay until
one o'clock then I shall go to three lectures which will last from that till
4, then to meeting again, where I suppose I shall stay until past 6. I attend
lectures today (which I did not yet since last 6th day) because it
is the last day of the course, & I expect to get my certificates. Hoping that
thou wilt have patience to get through this letter, & regularity to answer it
soon. I wish love to all thy relations & friends in Ballitore. I give thee
a friendly farewell, & still remain thine, Thomas Fisher.
Edward Alexander's affectionate remembrance.

his remembrance to thy mother, Deborah & thou. - I was
very much pleased at receiving the letter from thy mother requesting
me to meet Lydia coming in the boat; but why did
she post-pay the letter? Did she suppose I would not give
5d. for the pleasure of meeting her, & conducting her to her lodgings.
Edward Alexander went along with me when I went &
we saw both her & Mary Davis safely arrived at their respective
lodgings. - There was an annual meeting of the
members of the Hibernia Bible Society last seventh day;
I took Lydia & Mary Davis to it, & we heard several
beautiful speeches. The Quaternion as thou might expect
soon found each other out, & we were all together. Joseph
Humphreys informed us of the name of each speaker
distinctly. It was very fully & very respectably attended.
as he stood up which added a good deal to our
pleasure; but we only heard two or three of them
Doctor Thorpe, who came [deletion]on from[/deletion] from London on purpose
to attend it, made a noble speech, & so did Matthews.
Peter Rod, a clergyman, spoke audibly, distinctly & eloquently;
he delighted the whole assembly, & excited loud
tributes of applause. Doctor Orpen also spoke; but not
loud enough to be generally heard; though from what I
could hear of it, I believe his speech to [insertion]have[/insertion] been the most useful;
tho' perhaps not the most elegant among them. He spoke
of his travels in France & Italy, the great scarcity of Bibles,
& consequent prevalence of Popery there. I strongly recommended
the printing of the Irish Bible in the Irish character. Bickerstaff,
an African missionary also spoke. He informed us
