These signs alas, too truly said
[deletion]Signs which betrayed the truth to dread[/deletion]
That Reason's precious [insertion]guiding[/insertion] light was fled.
Now, to the maniac maid draw nigh
Each youthful chief with pitying eye
"Louisa turn, thy Henry see":
"Depart - not one of [deletion]these is he[/deletion] you is he".
a distant voice now strikes her ear,
"'Tis his, 'tis Henry's voice I hear".
And [deletion]now[/deletion] blithe & gaily [deletion]enters in[/deletion] steppeth in
A gallant youth of graceful mien.
He starts - he would retire - but no -
Louisa will not part him so.
She deems a long lost treasure - found
Her strong arms entwine him round:
"Give me thy hand - my plighted Love,
"Full safely have I kept thy glove,
But this is not the [deletion]ray[/deletion] [insertion]ring[/insertion] whose blaze
Adorn'd thy hand in happier days,
Yet [deletion]But[/deletion] sure the [deletion]day[/deletion] [insertion]hour[/insertion] is happy now, -
Com'st thou not to fulfil thy vow?
never, oh never let us part,
Take pity on my breaking heart."
Her fond caress, her melting tone,
Her eyes, where love & madness shone
Touched, deeply touched [deletion]the generous[/deletion] [insertion]those generous souls[/insertion] heart
Which manly tenderness [deletion]comfort[/deletion] controuls
[deletion][/deletion]
No longer of their sternness proud;
Th[deletion]e[/deletion][insertion]ose[/insertion] youthful warriors wept aloud-
[deletion]All all but he did not weep[/deletion]
Who gave the wound inflicted deep
On His Majesty's Service.
The Postmaster of

Confusion on his aspect hung
And chaind the guilty lover's tongue.
He told not [deletion]that his arts[/deletion] [insertion]how he had[/insertion] beguiled
And robb'd the parents of their child*
Her mind by [deletion]storms of[/deletion] stormy passes tost
Her honour blasted, reason lost
*Then [deletion]gave[/deletion] his promises to air, And left his victim to despair,
Was this a triumph.

[unclear]I [unclear][/unclear] & charm

He felt the [unclear][/unclear]
swift & withdrew
scorpion stings
and fled his guilt to rue.

"O why fair maid so mild so young
Stray'st thou these martial [deletion]be[/deletion] ranks among?
This scene is all unmeet for thee,
Fair Maiden turn, retire with me".
"O Lady through these ranks I rove
I seek my Henry, my true love.
The martial garb my Henry wore;
The glittering sword my Henry bore.
Know'st thou my Henry? bid him come,
And bear his lost Louisa home.
Lady I go with thee; I know
Thou pitiest poor Louisa's wo."
"Now rest thee, lovely wanderer: tell
where do thy friends & kindred dwell?
Me thinks thou[deletion]st[/deletion] [insertion]hast[/insertion] trod a weary way
Why unprotected dost thou stray?"
"Oh ask me not my friends to name,
Nor seek from whence Louisa came :
Yet how my way I hither won
I know not, but my journey done
Call Henry to his plighted spouse
I come to claim my Henry's vows."
The [deletion]pitying[/deletion] [insertion]generous[/insertion] Lady [deletion]sadly sigh'd[/deletion] [insertion]saw distress'd [/insertion]
The wanderings of her hapless quest.
The restless glance, the hurried tone,
The blush now glowing & now gone
The slender form by travel worn,
Yet by an ardent maid upborne,
I do not understand this, nor
choose to understand it till altered
