[October, 1871}
My dear Emily
I am truly sorry to
hear of the death of your
dear Mother she was always
a kind and sincere
friend to me - I wonder
what you will all do without
her as though so long
delicate she seemed to
keep you all together &
to be the guide and
Counsellor of [deletion][/deletion] all -
As to poor Father I dont
know what will become
of him in this heavy

bereavement - There is
no one like a Mother
to Children if they would
only think so & it is
when she is gone they
really value her - I dont
want you to write to
me but I just wished
to let you know we
are truly grieved for
your trouble but we
cannot comfort you
our Lord & Saviour
can alone do so -
my dear love to Jane
all I can say to her
is that I have thought
since I heard about [unclear]Pearl[/unclear]
that these words were
applicable "for in Heaven
their Angels do always
behold the face of my
Father who is in Heaven" -
Dear love to you all
especially to your father
your afft. Aunt
Huldah Barrington
