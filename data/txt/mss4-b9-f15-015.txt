Helen Gillies's 2 Hay's street Edinburgh 11th Mo. 26th 1820.
Thomas Fisher to Sarah Leadbeater.
I began this letter, (which I expect to be some time in completing.)
with offering thee & thy younger sister my most hearty thanks for your long
& very acceptable letters, thee for thine of the 14th of 9th Mo & Lydia for her two, [underline]begun[/underline] on the
24th of 9th & the 28th of 10th Mo. respectively. - I wish now to offer some explanation for not replying
to them before I answer the letters of my regular [insertion]Ballitore[/insertion] correspondents once a month in the
order in which I receive them, & I should not think it just to defer an answer to one
of these for a [underline]month[/underline], for the sake of replying to thee or Lydia, who are [underline]irregular[/underline] correspondents
& whom I cannot afford to add to my [underline]regulars[/underline]! lest each of you should complain of my
delay in replying to his or her letter.- I therefore can seldom write to you, [deletion]except[/deletion] unless when
a private opportunity occurs or when I have no [deletion]answers[/deletion] letters from my [underline]regular[/underline] correspondents
to answer. - This latter circumstance is the case just now, & I therefore begin this letter with
the intention of sending it on the 9th of next month [underline]if[/underline] I should get no [underline]regular[/underline] letter
before that day but if the contrary, I intend to keep this for a month longer unless a pri[deletion]vioius[/deletion][insertion]ate[/insertion]
opportunity should occur sooner.- As this explanation is becoming rather too long I
must stop here merely adding that I intend writing this [underline]a la mode de Lydia[/underline], from
day to day. at my leisure hours, or when I have something interesting to offer. -
Thou asks me why I have chosen so difficult a subject for my thesis - I answer
because I am interested with it - & an interest in a subject often conquers many apparent
difficulties - It is 12 o'clock nearly so I must go to the Infirmary.
2 o'clock - I am now come back to talk to thee again for a while. - Yes. Sarah. I thought
Scotland was a land of freedom before I came because I judged from her [underline]literature[/underline], but of
America I judge from her [underline]Constitution[/underline] - I trust I shall never say that "Freedom
is no where to be found." - Surely there are not times for the friends of Freedom to despair,
when we behold nations which we thought were destined to groan in chains for
years, suddenly burst forth & astonish us with the bold vigour tempered with moderation
which we supposed was possessed only by nations accustomed to the Spirit of Liberty!
I hope to see the Spanish Cortes assuring an interest & a consequence before attained
by no legislative bodys of a modern Europe for any length of time, but the British
Parliament - Perhaps indeed that Spain is destined to stand in the plan which
England (I won't say Britain for that includes [underline]Scotland[/underline]) has [deletion]w[/deletion] long held of being this
great [deletion]dis[/deletion] protector of the ark of Freedom & possessor of her standard to which she
may [deletion]call[/deletion] invite all the other nations in the world.-
Thou tells me you have read the first, & I suppose you have by this time read the
second volume of R. L. Edgeworth's Memoirs. - Well! & what dost thou think of it -
I have read two reviews of it, one in the Edinburgh, the other in the Quarterly Review.-
The first, which I suppose you have seen, is rather favourable, but I am surprised
at the Reviewer's choice in preferring the first to the second volume, even from the account
keeping the Sabbath (as they almost always call First-day) - & appear to think it the first & great commandment - without keeping which
strictly, & going regularly to kirk, nothing is of any avail - & with these you are safe in doing any thing - Their boast (which
you hear from them often enough) of their being the most [underline]religious[/underline] nation in the world, which is [insertion]pretty[/insertion] generally believed to be well-founded-
I think as vain a boast as ever was made. - One hears a great deal of [underline]talk[/underline] about Religion in Scotland, but when one looks for
the effects of it, they are not to be found - but enough of the Scotch, I will change the subject.
7th John Bewley's father-in-law James Neville, accompanied Huldah Seer from Liverpool & through Scotland - I had quite
forgotten the names, tho' on his mentioning to me at A Cruicks hands that John Bewley was his son-in-law. I immediately
recognised him, & called to his recollection the [underline]time[/underline] of our meeting in Ballitore (which was exactly a year before) tho he did
not recollect having seen me. - I leave thee to judge of this pleasure. I felt at this unexpectedly meeting with one who saw,
& knew, & loved the Athenians - the desire which I had till then felt towards him as a stranger [insertion]was[/insertion] immediately dispelled, &
we conversed with mutual delight on the friends whom we both knew in our native land - Thou mayest perhaps have heard
or read of this interview before for I think I mentioned it in some other Ballitore letter, but if excuse this twice-told tale
from one to whom it is interesting & who therefore feels pleasure whenever he thinks or speaks of it. -
I had lately a letter from Edward Alexander after a long interval of silence, which I was sorry to find, was caused by
his ill-health.- I sent him by Dr Harvey, some interesting tracts of Chalmers's which, I suppose he has shown you. - He mentions
our friend [underline]Dorothy[/underline]'s letter, D says that "it looked at first like a humbug".
There is at present in Edinburgh, attending the lectures, an M.D. of Philadelphia, named Samuel Morton, he brought me a
letter of introduction from Jacob Harvey, with whom he is well acquainted.- He is a Friend, & a [underline]Quaker;[/underline] he is a very agreeable
young man, & a true American in his politics tho' favourably inclined towards the English.- He goes to Ireland next-
spring, when I think I shall introduce him to you-
I suppose that Deborah has returned to you by this time, I hope the journey has been of use to her. - Did she receive a
letter which I wrote her about two months ago.-

which he gives of the work himself, & the extracts which he has quoted - I think the
first volume [deletion]but[/deletion] must be excessively tedious & the vanity displayed in it insufferably
disgusting. - The Quarterly Review is exceedingly severe on the work - it endeavours to
shew that many of the anecdotes which Edgeworth relates cannot possibly be true, & that
many others are very improbable, so that it leaves a very low impression of his veracity;
& its disputes his claim to all the [unclear]inventions[/unclear] related in the work, excepting what relates to
wheel-carriages - & a few trifling, useless, & [deletion]many of them[/deletion] inconvenient alterations which
he [unclear]contrived[/unclear] in [insertion]the[/insertion] furniture of his rooms. - They [insertion](the Q. reviewer)[/insertion] censure his daughter for not saying something
about her mother; & for her quibbling attempts to convey the idea that her father was a
believer in Christianity without ever [deletion]in[/deletion] directly asserting or denying it. - However, on the
whole, I should like to see the work & judge for myself.
Thy panegyric on Franklin, & [insertion]thy[/insertion] wish for such as he, to govern our own country
I perfectly coincide with. - His is a character which must interest everyone - the
tradesman, the philosopher, the politician. - No, I have never met with Sir Joshua
Reynolds discourses, nor even heard of them until thou mentions them. With thy
comparisons of [insertion]the[/insertion] [deletion]human[/deletion] virtues to a picture I was much pleased.
I have entirely given up going to London, & again deferred my graduation, in consequence
of an application to my father, till the summer after next. - I find my time sufficiently
occupied this winter without grinding. - The Porter at the Infirmary informed
me to-day that there was half as many applications from the students this year for Infirmary
tickets as last - this I think is alarming news if the number of graduations
[deletion]is[/deletion] [insertion]will be[/insertion] increased (which I think) very probable, in the same proportion - 121 graduates last
summer - Since thou wished for a letter which thou wilt not be obliged to show to the
whole village, I hereby authorize thee to show this to no person whatever but thy
mother & Lydia. - No; I do not forget that Scotchmen write the Edinburgh Review -
but [deletion]I don't[/deletion] neither do I forget that the Edinburgh Review is read less & [unclear]abused[/unclear]
more by Scotchmen than by either English or Irish men - Nothing is to be heard
of the Edinburgh Review here but among the Whigs. - Except indeed the [unclear]abuse[/unclear]
which it meets with monthly in Blackwood Magazine - Thy letter in general
must be very short if thou never wrote so long a letter before as thy last to me - it
is a long short [deletion]to be sure[/deletion] it is true, but it is not [unclear]crossed[/unclear] - I think I have received
many longer letters from Ballitore - but it is time for me to take my daily walk -
1 of 12 Mo. - After about a week's interruption, I return to thee again. - I thank thee
for thy congratulations on the acquisition of Henry [unclear]Saulter[/unclear] as an acquaintance - I indeed
admire him very much, but why dost thou think he surpasses Orpen? - Not in
deeds of benevolence surely - Since our last interview (this day week) we, the [underline]Royal[/underline] Medical
Society, elected Henry our [underline]first[/underline] president - I voted for him of course - four presidents
are annually elected, two of the four which I voted for were elected, one is first, the
other second, - the other two, an Irishman named Moriarty, & a Scotchman named
Mackintosh, were unsuccessful - Do not be afraid of tiring me with thy long letters. - a
letter from a Ballitore person never tired me yet. - I have heard one or two of the poems of
A new satirical novel has been just published, named "Edinburgh," which I have a great curiosity to see - I am
told its principal characters are taken from life, which will render it very interesting here. I have bespoken it at a circulating
library, so that I expect soon to read it, & I shall probably give an account of it in my letter to Lydia. Now that I mention
Lydia, please to tell her that I must acknowledge the deficiency in our [underline]correspondence[/underline] to be entirely on my side; but that
I hope in time to sustain my share, at least with respect to [underline]length[/underline] & [underline]number[/underline] of letters. I admire her zeal on behalf of
our Queen - yes, Regina still, in spite of them - but what put it into her head that "the good soul of York" as she calls
him, espoused the cause of his sister-in-law - I believe he voted for the bill. -
I can the more patiently [deletion]first[/deletion] bear the [deletion]sacrifice[/deletion] deprivation of thy mother's correspondence when I hear that she is
so much better employed than in writing to me - The blessing of Heaven on her work! - I think the [underline]common sense[/underline] of
friends Journals require some pruning of that kind to render them interesting to young persons - some indeed it would
be almost a pity to abridge, as John Woolman's & perhaps a few others - And I can the more willingly excuse her
when she allows me the privilege (for such I certainly consider it) of receiving "her daughters' ample communications."
Please to tell her that I don't often meet with Captain [unclear]Ramoge[/unclear] at A. Cruickshank's - but the few times that I
did meet him there, I was very much pleased with his company. - The last place that I saw him was in the Friends'
Meeting House with 2 or 3 of his children listening to Huldah Seer - A answer thy own few lines on Lydia's
sheet by saying that I received a pretty ... but not [deletion]"stup "s[/deletion] "stupendous sheet, signed not "S. L." but "ye ken wha."
8th Thow must know, Sarah, that I have been elected, sorely against my will, a member of the Apparaters Committee of the Medical
Society, & am greatly bothered about entering how to get off it. - I have, for this purpose, drawn up a resignation to the
President, which I intend to present this evening; but one of my friends says he will object to its being received, & then I am
afraid I shall be called on for the reason why I resign, & I have no reason, but that I don't like to have any thing to
do with committees. - I find it is no great advantage to me to be acquainted with [insertion]any of[/insertion] the Presidents, for one of the first acts of
my friend President Gaulter was to put me on a committee for counting up a long list of works for the Library committee
Thou wilt excuse me; for troubling thee [deletion]with such[/deletion] about these committees; which thou cares as little about as I do

Barton, the Quaker poet, whom thou mentions - they were [underline]pretty[/underline] bad - I think
did not display any great genius - Thy account of Corinna makes me anxious
to read it. tho' I am not very fond of works of imagination - but Madame de
Stael has become a great favourite of mine since I read her most admirable
work on the French Revolution The resemblance of Corinna to Child Herold would
make me like it still more.
My love to thy sister Lydia, & tell her that her letters are most acceptable & shall not be
unanswered. In the mean time let me recommend her through thee to read (if she has not already
done so) at her leisure from more serious advocations, - the review of "Hogg's Jacobite
Relics" in the last number of the Edinburgh Review - it is quite appropriate to the subject
which we were lately upon. Lydia certainly does not deserve [deletion]the[/deletion] [insertion]such[/insertion] severe chiding [deletion]which[/deletion] [insertion]as[/insertion]
Hogg has received, for her [deletion]att[/deletion] attachment to the [deletion][/deletion] Stuart family,- as it springs, not
like Hogg's from an unprincipled Toryisan, but from what is certainly an amiable tho'
I think mistaken feeling - sympathy with their misfortunes. - I trust therefore that
she requires nothing more than a knowledge of their true characters to induce her to desert
their cause; & that her love of Liberty is too ardent & too permanent to be transferred
to a tyrannical family, merely because they are unfortunate. I presume thou wilt expect
no apology from me for this indirect apostrophe to thy sister. - But while my attention
is turned from thee, allow me to return thy brother's kind salutation of love, & thanks
for the verses which he sent which gratified me very much.
My father & James having given up their American [underline]whim[/underline] as it now
turns out to hew a [unclear]beam[/unclear], I lately made application again to postpone my gra[unclear][/unclear]
until the year 1822, which was assented to - I certainly find that I have
enough to do even now, & don't know what I should do if I were obliged to [underline]grind[/underline]
every day in addition - I must go walk, & probably cannot come to thee again for another week.
6. [deletion]As this is a w[/deletion] Half past 3 o'clock. As this is a wet evening I can spare thee a
little of my [underline]walking[/underline] time, - Have any of you heard lately of Dr. Harvey. - The last circumstance
respecting him which I heard was that he was attending his brother William, who was ill
of a fever in Belfast. -
There has been lately here a female ministering friend from Virginia named Huldah [underline]Seer[/underline]. -
(what a appropriate name for a minister!) I heard some time ago of her arrival in Ireland,
so that I suppose you will have seen her before thou receive this letter. She is an
exeedingly delicate woman - She passed twice through Edinburgh & remained here a few
days each time, & whenever any stranger is at Cruickshank's (where friends generally
lodge) his wife is always so kind as to invite me over to share his or her company. -
Huldah appeared a very agreeable woman, both in private [deletion]compa[/deletion] conversation,
& her public communication. - She seems to feel very strongly attached to the
"little flock" of Friends in Scotland - & in a meeting for members of the Society
alone, - she spoke of the great advantage which [deletion]consistent[/deletion] [insertion]the[/insertion] Friends here could
be made instrumental, - in the enlightening of "this [underline]dark[/underline] land of Scotland" -
Her opinion of the darkness of the Scotch in a religious sense - perfectly coincided
with my own. The laying stress on particular formalities observances and &c.
& neglecting the weightier matters of the law, is I think more universal & more
manifest than I ever observed it any where. - They pride themselves exceedingly on
myself; but really my mind is so occupied with my resignation & its consequences to night that I can scarcely turn my
attention to any thing else. - It was Dr. Stroud one of the [underline]busy-bodies[/underline] of the Society, who got me put on. - He can assure
for me, I find, pretty extensivly among members who do[unclear]n't[/unclear] know me at all; with it ever applying to me or the subject! &
Henry Gaulter came up to congratulate me the evening of my election! How provoking! - but enough of it. -
I am going to the [unclear][courts/unclear] to-morrow with Dr. Morton to show him Scott & Jeffrey. - They have both obtained honorus lately. Sir
Walter has been elected President of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, & Jeffrey has been elected Rector of the University of Glasgow.
Now, what more have I to say? - I labour under our disadvantage in corresponding with you, Athenians, which you do
not - that is, - that the every day occurrences which happen to me - the persons whom I see & with whom I converse [unclear]&c.[/unclear] - are not
interesting to you, not knowing any thing about them - whereas you have occurrences [unclear]taking [/unclear]plan atmost long day in your retired
& peaceful tho' oft times butting village, which were interesting to me, & I am acquainted with [insertion]many of[/insertion] them whom you see &
answer with every day. - However, perhaps I can make up a little for that dread vantage by introducing to thee some of my
friends have.  - To begin [underline]at home[/underline] show is in the first place Mrs. Jellen, my landlady, a kind & affectionate woman, very hot
[deletion]about[/deletion] - in the cause of the Queens, & getting himself into a dispute about her will about every one she [unclear]meets[/unclear] - that is almost
long [underline]lung's-man or woman [/underline] she meets. - I have two medical students fellow-border; very quiet, agreeable young man, one of
whom is from the lust & the other is from the West Indies, - another boy, about 14. attending some of the College Classes - named James
Wish; & a military officer named Brown has just come among us, who, I hope, will [unclear][/unclear] quit as - he is quite too say for us,
he [deletion]is going[/deletion] has to invited a large party, of his jolly companion to dinner here to-morrow no consequence of which I am going off to
dine at John, Rickman's. - John Rickman & Elizabeth his wife are a very agreeable pair of friends from the neighbourhood 
of London, who [unclear][/unclear] to remain in Edenburgh I [unclear][/unclear] about some law [unclear][/unclear] They have been exceedingly kind to [unclear][/unclear]
ever since they came, & tho' John has smited me to go [unclear]first[/unclear] to his house without invitation yet he invites me so often that
I can scarcely [unclear][/unclear] an opportunity of doing so. - However, as I was obliged to decline an invitation which he sent me last 7th day,
I think I shall [deletion]take[/deletion] avail [unclear][/unclear] of his kindness to-morrow, & leave this jovial party to enjoy themselves without me - John
& Elizabeth Beckman have both a literary tastes, so that I find their company uncommonly agreeable. - I shall next introduce
to thee Alexander [unclear]Cruickshamb's[/unclear] happy & harmonious family - Alexander himself is an elderly [deletion]friend[/deletion] [insertion]man[/insertion] in [insertion]rather[/insertion] delicate

health, - I think as worthy a man, & with as little ostentation as I ever
met with. - Anne Cruickshank, who is his second wife, is a Londoner, she
was formerly a Christy, & is remarkable for her excessive kindness & hospitality. -
I have met with as much kindness from Aleksander Cruickshank & his wife,
since I came here, as if they were acquainted with me all my life. - They have
5 children Edward, Lucy, George, Susan, & Rebecca - Edward, the eldest, I suppose
about 13 or 14 at school - the others all at home - I must go walk. Farewell. -
9th On my return from the Medical Society last night -, I received two [underline]rich[/underline] budgets
of letters from Ballitore, for which I cannot hope to make an [underline]adequate[/underline] return -
As for Lydia, I am sure I deserved nothing from her, & therefore could have expected
nothing in any circumstances, much less when she was suffering under
soreness of her eyes - I hope sincerely that they have suffered nothing on my account,
& that they are now well & [insertion]may[/insertion] continue so, & that she may
enjoy the perfect use of them - it was really too bad that she should hear attempted
writing to me under such circumstances - I need not attempt to
express my obligations to her - suffice it to say that I shall answer a letter
to her as soon as I find leisure, as a feeble return for the many through
of her excessive kindness & regard - I have just been along with Dr. Morton
seeing Sir Walter Scott & Jeffrey in the contests - Scott was very busy &
not hear Jeffrey - we however heard Cranstown, who is one
rather gains. - We [underline]saw[/underline] but did
of the abbot-counsellors at the Scotch bar on the side contrary
to that in which Jeffery is engaged - & I am
strongly inclined to think that Jeffrey is a bad care - I
am very anxious to know what he will make
of it. - Unfortunately the court adjourned just when
it came to Jeffrey's turn to speak; but I intend to go
& hear him reply next third day. - On account
of this & this matter, I have not yet had time
to finish [underline]all[/underline] the papers which you have sent me,
but I have read the letters - Many thanks to Deborah
for her kind affectionate & beautiful lines
If I go to America [deletion]I can[/deletion] & afterwards
apart of it, I can lay no blame certainly on you - &
if I stay & rejoice at it. You will have unconditional
claim on my gratitude, as well on a
participation in my joys. - I [underline]wish[/underline] I had a Member
of Parliament to [underline]frank[/underline] this
- but wishes in vain
Farewell, do well,
& be well -
