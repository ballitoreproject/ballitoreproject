I am so much oblig'd by my Dr friend
M: Shackletons kind attention in letting me hear of their
getting safe home; that I dont seem easy to let the Man
goe without acknowledging my gratitude by a [underline]few lines[/underline],
believing that when I tell her my belov'd John since we
parted has been bravely, [insertion]&[/insertion] almost quite free from pain, it
will render [underline]them[/underline] acceptable. I believe I may say that
through the goodness of kind [underline]providence[/underline] this fit seems
gone off, and I trust in [underline]his[/underline] Mercy will not return with
equal violence, oh may I be humbly thankful for this
great; this additional favour, added to the many I have
before receiv'd at his hands who can bless, & blast.
Thou can hardly think how lonely we appear'd the day
you left us, over & over we regretted the shortness of your
stay, & neither thy Father or self escap'd Censure, he for
hurrying you, & thou for depriving us of the Doctress
at a time that we felt the loss of your company so sensibly

H: Poole set out for Ross yesterday. —
I hope Cousin Betsey Pim is better than when she left
us, my Love to her. Am sorry we wont be gratify'd by thy
coming with Sally & the boys tomorrow, & hopes nothing may
prevent the Masters & thy calling on us, as you goe to
Waterford, we were pleas'd to hear thy Sister Lydia was
so well as to get to Meeting. S: W: Just returnd [insertion]from[/insertion] Evan's
endeavouring to get Aby's Money, but was unsuccessfull
if he dont be more fortunate in a few days will let
him know; at present defers writing; he unites with
me in dear Love to both families. The Man takes thy
saddle cloth, I have been busy in the Garden all the
Morn striving to divert a bad headach, wch must
apologize for the stupidity of this, but be asurd my
heart is sincere, when I subscribe myself
