Limerick 3 June 1823
My dear Sister
I must not I suppose repeat to you information
concerning the wanderers - The day after I
arrived I had a few lines from Eben announcing their
arrival at Bangor & on Sunday I had a letter from Lydia
herself saying they were settled at Mrs. Lewis's lodgings in
Bangor - Lydia writes in a delighted manner thus been
wandering among the mountains - I had no letter today
and as Eben wrote on the back of Lydia's letter that thy
would remain until Tuesday that is today I conclude
that they leave Bangor [insertion]this day, [/insertion] but for what part of the world
I am in total ignorance - probably to return to you
if so you will have nothing but to oblige me by presenting
the enclosed letter & if you have intelligence of thin going
elsewhere be so kind as to direct this letter accordingly &
forward it - I forget to tell you in my last when I was
writing in such a hurry about tho Key of Lydia's trunk
that there are two stones of flax belonging to Mary Shackleton
in Lydias great Travelling Bag which she left in her
room - If Mary remains in Dublin until Lydia returns
the flax is snug where it is, but if she is going away, may
I beg you will come at the flax and give it to her - The key

of the Bag is very small & is lying in one corner of Lydia's trunk
You will empty the mouth of the Bag & underneath all you
will discover in brown paper parcels the said flax - Mary will
help you to pull them out for they are stuffed in very tight -
I hope my little niece Margery is well & pleasant - I expect
to have the pleasure of saluting her with a kiss before the
month is over - When you see Dick Webb tell him I am angry
that he did not come see me depart - My companion
James Pike returns today & takes this - I shall be proud
of a letter from you when you have time to send me
a few lines - I should like to know what you have found
from the wandering trio. I have not heard from Ballitore
since my return, I must [underline]tell [/underline] them what I am
thinking of - You & Edwd & Mary Shackleton might
eurily make up a letter for me - Mary will not have
any objection to write to her [underline]cousin [/underline] - to encourage her
thereto give her my love - Does she favor you with her
company often? My father is better than when I wrote
last- he was at breakfast in the parlour this morning
and in good Spirits - Joe Pim paprd through Limerick on his
way to prosecute his suit in the Court of Judge Cupid to be held
in Cork this Term - report says that this little Judge will send
it forthwith into the Court of Hymen - All the fair defendants
friends are in favour if the transfer - It remains to be seen how

she will plead - Bets 2 to 1 on Joseph - Time presses & hince &
tide & mail coaches & passengers wait for no man - I must
conclude then - love to Edwd. & a kiss to pretty mistress Margret
Your very affectionate brother
