Amsterdam 6th month 29th 1790

My dear uncle

	Thine & dear E. Pims salutations from London, covering a lively epistle from my beloved friend R. Jones were altogether a very pleasant & salutary repast  It is not always that we are letter hungry, but I think I was that morning  indeed travellers are sometimes so faint & their meals so irregular that their appetites get sharpened for any thing that is wholesome  they eat their morsel with gratitude & in a simplicity similar to the sons of Jacob, when ^eating the passover^ all state & form were dispensed with, & they only leaned on their staff  In the outward this sort of fare agrees very well with us in general  for my part I am growing quite stout, nothing comes wrong to me in the provision way & the time allotted for sleep only seems to short for the use I make of it  But, that dear S. Dillwyn has been a little ailing for a few days owing to too great liberties she takes with her precious little carcase [sic], I might say that our company is very healthy 
	Were it not that we were instructed not to seek great things & are a little acquainted with the obscurity of the true seed; we might probably sink into greater discouragement than we have yet been suffered to do, tho a portion of it thou ^wilt^ readily beleive [sic] ^sometimes^ attends that exercise, which is necessary to be maintained, in order to understand with a degree of holy confidence, whether we are bound to or dismissed from, some places where we come; especially those we may have had some ^a^ view of  we have hitherto found that our minds have been strengthened & cemented into best unity, when we have sat down professedly to wait for the guidance of truth or a discovery that the cloud was on the tabernacle  Thy fatherly hint on this subject being correspondent with our best judgment has an animating effect, like the meeting in ^a^ solitary journey (amongst those who know little of the Lords holy mountain) with a cheerful traveller suitably cloathed for the ascent, who says come & let us go up &c  We do indeed come to places where a door of entrance is hardly to be found & thus far, after trying 
to do our best or ^being resigned^ to suffer according to the masters will have passed on to another  & why not? when he whose holy hand was full of blessings, was persecuted, despised & rejected of men: if without arrogance we can trust that we are his disciples anything that we have yet met with, only convinces us that instead of not being above our Lord, we fall infinitely short of experiencing in our passage, the trials to humanity over ^which^ the meekness of the Lamb so gloriously triumphed 
       Your communications with Clonmel are so frequent & domestic that I presume our little perigrinations [sic] as related to our friends there, have transpired to Ballitore, the substance of which is, that after paying a visit of a full week to Dunkirk, having four public meetings & divers private ones, we left friends ^there^ & proceeded to x Ostend where we spent a day to a good degree of satisfaction finding a man & his wife ^from London^ belonging to the society who had no seen any reputable friends for eight years, & it was comfortable to beleive [sic] that in them both, there was something to visit & which accepted the testimony of truth as far as related to themselves  Our men also distributed divers books much to satisfaction, for in this very trifling service as it may seem, we often find a great difference in our feelings, sometimes as if a grain of faith was afforded that the blessing goes with it, & at others as thought it was no more than like bread cast upon the waters, without hope of any return, in any day, or age 
From Ostend we went to Bruges, Flushing & Middleburg, at all which we solemnly paused & also exposed ourselves to the observation & acquaintance of the people, intimating to some our errand & making enquiry for such as are seeking the Truth; with some small exception they people appeared to be in their strong-holds & fenced cities, intent upon the worlds gain, which is with too much propriety is called their god  however we left a few books & finding a nephew of M. Watsons at Middleburgh of the name of Kendall had an opportunity of religious retirement & releiving [sic] our minds with him, which we beleived [sic] he kindly accepted, according to his own acknowledgments & attention to us  From Middleburgh we went to Cumphire [?] & there hired a little vessel to take us among the island of Zeeland to Rotterdam  We had a very pleasant cheerful passage, our minds being favored with much tranquility ^ uncommon sweetness^ & after a thirty hours sail arrived at our port where as expected ^we^ entered again into ^fresh^ trial of fidelity to the precious cause  here we staid three days, visitted our former [?] [seal torn] acquaintance (who were very kind) & commenced some new [seal torn] knew best how to receive disciples in the name of disciple [seal torn] one or two of this class our minds were particularly united  had two public meetings both considerably attended & satisfactory but particularly the latter which was truly solemn  after paying our visit in this place X we came to Amsterdam & here we seem fast  the cloud resting longer upon the tabernacle than is pleasant to the creature  we have already had two public meetings (one 1st day) both favoured good meetings which was humblingly encouraging to us, ^our minds^ we being reduced very low previous thereto, especially dear G.Ds, & this evening (viz 4th) another is appointed  J. Marcillac & my husband have been translating extracts from H. Turfords grounds &c into french & the printing of it here, is also an occasion & perhaps a right one of detaining us longer than we might otherwise have given up to 
30th	Since writing the foregoing we have received by letter from our A.B. & an addition from our precious sister Margaret an affecting account of poor brother Josephs health  My dear RG is in trouble thereat & looking whether it may not be right for him to leave us (as J.B. is a good are taker) & return to domestic duties  GD also has received account of a considerable loss of 
property by the failure of a person who had money of his, & our beloved J. marcillac informs us that his way now opens toward home & that probably in a few days he must part us  These circumstances are like the awakening of the north wind! We are cordially united in humble exercise for sure guidance & resignation  Tobesure dear GD takes his blast like a man who being confident that the principal part of his treasure is in Heaven, hardly thinks the other worth sighing after  J. Marcillacs steppings have been so long under one ^holy^ Director who has marvellously enlightened them, that we are afraid to interfere, beleiving [sic] that his return is under the same apprehension of duty he had in coming out, ^in^ the rectitude ot which we have beleived [sic], having found him a cheerful, solid sensible & exercised man  he has divers times appeared very lively in meetings & has had considerable service out of them in many places & also in this city amongst the great folks  he says he had never so delicious a journey before (being always a solitary traveller) & is very low at the thoughts of parting 
John desires to be affectionately remembered to thee  he has a liberal soul & knows how to embrace the divine workmanship & attach himself only to the household of faith  Our dear Joshua is a lovely plant & I hope at present in right soil, though far from being of my choosing for him  he has received no letter from his uncle Neale yet  Dost not thou write him sometimes?  a hint to remember poor Joshua in this way would be kind in thee  I have no doubt of dear Samuel and Sarahs feeling hearts sympathizing & uniting with their nephews sincere & humbling endeavours after peace, for it was greatly in the cross [?] he came & with out any baitt [sic] being intentionally thrown out by any of us, at least by me; not having courage for any such thing; but now I hope it is for the best & therefore wish that the best may be made of it  Thy intimations on the subject have been very comfortable 
We are informed by J. Pim of your safe landing in Dublin [paper torn] dear Betsy & thee  I hope you are now peacefully reflecting upon your late ^journey^ & commemorating hidden support & holy protection therein  may you also continue to remember in the renewings [sic] gospel fellowship your poor friends on the continent who are at times tribulated & cast down but not forsaken  my dear Sally Shackleton sweely occurs to my mind, I had thought of writing to her till thy kind letter came & turned the ^little^ stream into they field  Our whole company of which Ben. Rotch is a part ([illegible] with JM) desire to unite in affectionately saluting thee & thine & hoping that thou wilt communicate the word of exhortation & comfort I subscribe myself (as I truly feel) thy unfeignedly affectionate & obliged friend Sarah R. Grubb
Dont forget to remind dear Abram & Lydia of us

[note address panel]
Since writing the within I have received ^a letter^ from my beloved S.S. which please to acknowledge for me  She has often of late been the companion of my mind & I hope to be able sometime to scribble a little to her  our love to SS J Haughton when thou seest them & to poor Hannah tobesure she is learned in the school of affliction

7th month 1st
Tis probably that in a few days we shall depart for Pyrmont but its very doubtful whether till after another 1st day  We have no further accounts from Clonmel  Utrecht is like to be our next stopping place 

[note margin p. 2, first x]
We escaped the usual difficulties at this time in travelling thro Brabant where there are great commotions as also in other nieghbouring states which denote [sic] an almighty hand at work 

[note margin p. 3, second x]
We fell in with a young Baron at our inn who was very friendly & whom J Marcillac took aside & counseled very plainly & affectionately which he took kind  he comes from Prussia & gave us his address
