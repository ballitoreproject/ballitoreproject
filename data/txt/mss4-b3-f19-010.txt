Waterford 18/12 month 1780


Dear Uncle,


        This morning brought the pleasing account of your welfare at home & the melancholy news of poor Billy Keatings which I imparted to Pat: in consequence he has set off for Ballitore as he is apprehensive the disorder may be fatal Billys constitution being so much broken. They had not heard from him of a good while before. If Pat want [sic] to write home I believe he can be supplied with a Frank or two at the Retreat. The enclosed letter I delivered at Capt. Helys lodgings. This night I purposed writing had I not received thine for if I had written yesterday it would have made no difference. Archibald & his Wife are both poorly: she has pretty much kept her bed all last week they were both bled to-day. Since he returned from Dublin he has been cupped in the back twice or perhaps oftener without being apparently much better for it. I have not heard any thing of Hannah Prospect since I came to Waterford how she gets her health she has had a long struggle it would give me great pleasure to hear she was was [sic] getting the better. I hope thy Grandson Richard has continued to improve as he promised if so he must be a great entertainment to his good Friends at the Retreat This weather is so mild I suppose he travels over frequently. I beg to be presented affectionately to every individual in both families & am
        Dear Uncle
                thy dutiful Nephew
                        William Rayner
AB & his Wife always desire their love to be remembered when I write.
