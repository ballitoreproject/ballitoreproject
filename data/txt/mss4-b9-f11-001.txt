Mar 11th 1820.
My dear Sarah.
The inclosed will tell how
anxious James H. is to have you
this evening at his mother's house,
if you possibly can go, I know how
much it would gratify him. But
remember, dear Sarah, my german
friend must get the preference, if
you can spare only one evening,
if you can command two, I am
willing to go with you on both
occasions.
yours very
affectionately
W. Downes.
P S. Let me Know
against 4 oclock
whether you can call
upon me this evening
to go to Henry's.
Sarah Leadbeater.
