My dear E - I am sorry I did not send the right oil'd
silk but I hope thou wilt return that which I sent
I think it is likely the person from whom I bought it it
will take it back: - I saw Jane Stephens to day
she look'd tolerably well, Ellen Haughton spoke to
me or rather answere'd me when I spoke to her
so [deletion]coldly[/deletion] coldly that I might almost doubt if
she knew who I was, I'm afraid England
had at the best effect on her - M A Lebatt is here
at present I do not think she will stay very long she is not
the person who would suit us, at least so far as I have
seen of her, she has a great many acquaintances here
a very stileish visit[deletion]ers[/deletion] Betsy had a most agreeable account
of my mother in Hannah's letter I hope I shall soon
see you all again but cannot say when thy SB
dearest love to my mother in which Edw joins

Joseph Strangman & Mary R call'd to day

handsome boy

send us another sack of potatoes
