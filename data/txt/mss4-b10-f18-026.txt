Queenstown - Cork
July 3rd 58 -
My dear Mamma
I am commissioned
by Manliff to answer your note.
which we are just after receiving,
and which it gave
us great pleasure to get - he
bids me tell you that if Mr.
Nugent says that the carriage
is fit to take, you may do
so, as if any thing is wrong

he will make them alter it
when he returns, but you are
to bid John Byrne examine
it well before he takes it,
to see if the things are done
which he knows it wanted,
he (Manliff) thinks it better
you should have it, as the
weather is cold -
This is a most magnificent
harbour, I suppose one of
the finest in the world,
We are anchored quite near
a ship of war, & have the
benefit of their music on
board, she fires a loud
shot, at sunrise & sunset -
We are just going to Cork
by one of the river steamers
so I must make my note
a short one, with Manliff's
love & my own to you, Lucy
& Frank, believe me your
most attached MJB
Please write to us, and send us [underline]fresh[/underline]
newspapers, Manliff says he is much
obliged for your note -
