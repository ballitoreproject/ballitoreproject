My dear Mother
I had so little time to write
this morning that I did not tell thee much
about ourselves Since then I have got thy
letter and the baskets I was not in town my
self but sent Pat with the mare and cart
he brought in what I sent carefully and brought
me out the others in return which arrived
all safe except soda which I do not see & which
is mentioned in F's bill. I suppose I need not
have sent the rasberries but I thought it a pity
not to do so when they were here as I did not
think Lany had any P will not send any
more of any thing untill I am desired it was
inconvenient sending in to day if I could
have helped it as Pat was wanting to get up the
hay but I sent for J Rocke. This is delightful
weather I wrote to the gentleman that was enquiring
about the Cottage that thou would set it to

him for 36Â£ untill the first of March but not
longer unless he would take it for another year
I did not enter unto particulars but referred him
to Edward to whom I sent thy letter. I did not
hear whether he ever called on C. or not. that is
all that I know about it. I just mentioned
in my note this morning that McDernoche was
here, I had a note by post from Sally Savage
telling me that if fifth day was fine she & her
Mother Margt D & Mimy & Masmion would call
here on their way to dine on the sod and asking
Manliff & I to go with them. M said
he would not come he believed, at any rate he had
to go to Fassaroe early and as they were not out
before he left this we could not fix where to meet.
They came about eleven, and I arranged every
thing here as well as I could, and then I thought
I might go, I took Pat & the car it was very well
I did as they had asked [underline]Peter[/underline]& William Jackson
and as they had no vehicle, the[deletion]y[/deletion] [insertion]company was[/insertion] divided between
the two cars. We went to Darlington's
Glen as soon as we got there I sent Pat to Fassaroe
to tell Manliff & Arthur [deletion]that[/deletion]where we were and
that there company was requested at dinner.
but they sent back word that they were going to

theirs but that perhaps Manliff would come after
which he did & walked about with us. I had a
currant pie which I brought and also a little mug
of butter both of which they seemed to enjoy very
much also a basket of gooseberries. We had a
very pleasant day and they came home to the
Glen to tea it seemed very odd to me to have so
many and no one mistress but myself. On sixth
day evening I drank tea at the Lunells. I think
Mrs. L is only middling, her breathing seems bad
but perhaps I am not a judge the rest are all
finely. I forgot to tell thee that [underline]Peter[/underline] asked
very particularly for thee now for an acct
of yesterday. Manliff & Frederic seemed to
have set their minds on having a day at
Lough Bray. I was to make up the party & get a car for
them & M to find the provisions. so on seventh day
evening Fred brought out Sally & Susan G to sleep
& Masmion was to be out to breakfast in the morning.
they hired Donovan's car and had little Tommy to
drive & our own car. when I was putting up the
things which I did not do untill after they came
out, thinking it was not likely they would come, Ann
said she wished I would take her & she would be
butler & manage all the things for me. I thought
it a capital plan & as there was plenty of room we
took her she enjoyed herself greatly & so did Pat. [deletion]I[/deletion]
[deletion]never[/deletion]We left this at half past nine met Manliff &

Arthur at Enniskerry. I never saw the country
look so delightful. The day was as fine as it
could be indeed so hot that we were nearly roasted
we went at once to the Upper lake and there we
dined & loitered about untill six oclock when we
thought it full time to be on the move. I don't know
when I saw Manliff enjoy himself more indeed
they all seemed to enjoy themselves and behaved
as well as if there had been a matron to take care
of us. it was late enough when we got home &
I had to give them all a lodging so thou may
think I had a busy time of it, now my dear Mother
I hope thou don't think we did wrong in leaving
the place, so long, every thing seemed safe

when we got home & Ellen said she took
as much care of them as if we were here
to watch them, the only thing that was at all
unpleasant was that it was first day I believe we
would all have rather have it of a week day if it could
have been. I had breakfast ready for them at
light this morning, the four towns people went
to the rail road on Donovans car & Arthur went
to Fassaroe & I went to regulate my affairs &
to pull the goosberries to go to town I sent a basket
to Sarah Elizth & to S Malone & the things
for Dunlavin. I have told thee now all about ourselves
& how we are getting on. Thou did not mention any
 thing of Susy how she is getting on or what is the
childs name is she [underline]nameless[/underline] still give my dear
love to F & L. I am glad Eliza is gone to Ballitore
do not hurry her home on my acct if she is enjoying
herself there as I can do very well a while
longer by myself though sometimes I feel very
lonesome. I write in such a hurry this morning

that I forgot to mention I had a letter from
Martha, but as there was nothing new in it
'twas not of much consequence it was written
from Paris which they were to leave in a few days
for Geneva they were not to stay there long and expected
to be in London in a fortnight She desired
her dear love to thee I sent her congratulations to
F & L and was very glad to hear that the latter was
so well. this is a long letter it is well if thou wilt
be able to get through it. it is full time to stop
however as it almost bedtime. so with dear love
I am thy affect. daughter Selina
Love to Eliza when thou sees her

For M B
