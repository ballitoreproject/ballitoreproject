My dear Father,


        I am now in possession of thy valuable, instructive intelligent letter, which lays me under a fresh sense of obligation & gratitude, being so grateful in my solitary situation by the Wilderness, (but not in it) to hear how those go on who are engaged publickly in the battle, for a private warfare we all have to maintain, & must be faithfully engaged in if we expect to stand in favour with the Captain of our Salvation, & I find it necessary even in solitude, feeling the attacks of a cunning, wily, vigilant Enemy, ^by^ whose art many fallen. I came here again last second day with my little infant who had gotten cold whilst I was in town, & I thought the country air might help to remove it, Eliza appearing to have have received much benefit thereby, & Margaret also seems greatly braised [?] & strengthened by it; my Husband went same day to Youghal to Nathans marriage, which was accomplished the succeeding day, & they came home to his house 4th day evening: Nancys father I understand departed this life the day of her marriage, but I believe Nancy did not hear of it untill [sic] she came to Clonmel, Sam says it was an agreeable time at the marriage, I have not seen them since they came home: I wish they may be favoured with the blessing of Providence, which will sweeten the cares of attending the marriage state. I have not seen my beloved friend M. Dudley* since 1st day, she keeps aloof from me on account of the measles being amongst her children, at our last monthly meeting she went to the Mens meeting to return her certificate, but informing them I suppose that a concern remained on her mind to visit some person ^other parts of Lienster [sic]^ for which it was given, & that ^some^ occurrences in her family drew her from finishing, therefore the certificate was returned to her. She does not mean immediately to proceed to finish this work, as she is not well in health, & Sea bathing is particularly recommended to her, as a means of getting better thro her pregnancy, & labour, therefore she intends going first to Youghal for that purpose, I have expressed this in a very hobbling manner, canst thou pick sense out of it? it is ^by^ night I am striving to write, being so engaged with the children by day, & I am afraid my Son Samuel will not indulge me by staying asleep till I finish, perhaps the day may come I may not be so straitened, & yet, is not the best of my days, the bloom & prime passing away, & shall I adopt the mournful language of one formerly And I see no Good. I acknowledge I am favoured many ways outwardly, but ^in^ the greatest riches I am ^poor,^ miserable, blind & Naked. 
I am glad to hear from thee of my dear friend Joseph Garrat, I did not believe him from under the shelter & covering of the Divine wing, I believed his honest, humble prayer was for preservation, & that it would be granted, even in the hour of buffetting [sic] & temptation, as it is written, because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I will also keep thee in the hour of temptation &c. but what need I enlarge? how justly hast thou described the case both respecting him, & others, I believe the very thing. I trust our dear friend S: Neale will be like a polished shaft again amongst you, sent out of ^the^ quiver & may it hit the Man of Sin; I also believe he a portion of the spirit which ^was upon^ his Lord & Master will [seal] covering, anointing him to bind up the broken hearted, & [seal] erance to the Captive: & I trust his horn will be filled with fresh oil. I am pleased to hear good accounts of Mountmelick, how many boarders at M:B & ASs school? We are pleased thou canst give so agreeable a character of Johny [sic] Wilson, for his wifes sake (if for no other) we would wish all good to attend them, & are pleased we were not quite right in our opinion, but I did not mention him I believe as troublesome or intrusive, he was not at all so at our house, being little with us; my Husband gave up a good deal of his time to seek out a place for his residence, we dont see why ^we^ should apprehend they would be any incumbrance to us, they, like ourselves have to get their bread by honest industry, & keep it by daily care, in their line of life; & I hope if they continue religious & humble, their honest indeavours [sic] will be blessed, we think the prospect is agreeable, & the sooner they come the better; altho I took the liberty of making the remarks I did to thee of our opinion of the young Man, purely for his good, that he might by judicious hints from you, be improved with regard to what appeared to us exceptionable in his manners, & what would not gain him esteem, yet I did not make the least remark of the kind to any creature here (but my Husband, whose opinion coincided with my own) nor we did not think well to mention him as reduced or low in circumstances, rather to let him appear as one of some consequence, & not as at a loss, further than to say, there were sufficient of his trade left behind in Ballitore, knowing that ^the^ World smiles where fortune does, & that poverty too often brings contempt. I am sure my Husbands disposition is ready to do what he can, to help those he sees helping themselves. Poor [seal] I wonder did she overdo herself. I am afraid you will [seal days pass over before

you come to us, I wish you would come whilst we are all pretty well. Becky is on a visit to her Mother, looks very lusty. I wish we were all growing & thriving in the [horizontal p. 4[ best sense, but a lamentable lukewarmness, & stagnation of life has too much prevailed amongst many of us, it seems [two words crossed out] ^an^ infectious complaint, that wants a powerful remedy.
        I must conclude this scrawl, with the salutation of nearest love to both houses. I am pleased Anna is better: remain thy dutiful & affectionate daughterMargaret Grubb
