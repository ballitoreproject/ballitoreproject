~ November ~
Polly and T H go home. Georgina stays here -
1st.. Fourth day and Polly and Thomas
Henry are going home alas! alas!
Well! every pleasure has its end.
We prevailed on Georgina to stay a little
longer with us, but were not so
successful with Florence, who went
into town with Papa TH, Polly - also
myself for I was so very impolite as
to leave Georgina, for I wanted to get
some things for Liddy, and be with
Polly. They went by the 4 O'clock train.
Papa and I returned here by the 5Â½.
2nd.. Papa went to town. This has been another
lovely day. Georgina Avy and I walked
down to Sidney Herberts and back. I
got some slips from a lovely dark pink
rose tho' not there. Georgina and
Avy walked all the way to the top of
Correg[insertion]Bad spelling[/insertion]oleghan yesterday.
3rd.. Papa and Mamma went to town to day &
returned by the latest train. Before dinner
