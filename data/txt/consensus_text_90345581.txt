face appeared and in walked
little Dicky Musgrave -. How
he found his way all along
the lobbies almost surprised me,
and I guessed what he came
for the rogue - Alice too soon
made her appearance and I had
her company until tea time.
The gong sounded and down we
went - We found the group round
the new fire and I had a
nice little bit of conversation with
(-) After tea played two games
with Alice and then as Ned
had to go I followed him. He
saw the Doctor who thinks it better
not to bathe tomorrow -
I went down again with Hannah
Pim had another little bit of conversation
with (-) came up again
to see Ned, down again to tell
her I was not going to return
and then giving one [underline]last look[/underline]
retired on my solitary way -
Charlie and Patrick are to come tomorrow -
Not [underline]very[/underline] U. [underline]H. Y.[/underline] P.
