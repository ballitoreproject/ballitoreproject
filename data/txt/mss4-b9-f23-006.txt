My dear Sarah
I promised fairly but
performed badly, making good the
old saying that promises and piecrusts
were made to be broken,
but as Richard and Betsy wrote
to thee frequently while poor E.
was so very ill my writing would
be very unnecessary - I can now
tell thee with pleasure, dear Eliza'th
is getting on as well as we could
expect considering all she has gone
through, she is improving in every
respect but sleep, [deletion]but[/deletion] the nights
she still passes uneasy, and restless,
however she slept more last night

than for many before, She is gaining
strength fast and getting a tolerable
appetite, She took a bit of broiled mutton
these two days for dinner, which
thy father dressed nicely for her, She
has not ventured to sit up yet, but
can help to turn and raise herself
much better, she suffers a deal still
from her back which is very sore
but I hope in a way to be better soon
The bit of dead flesh is coming away
and it has more the look of suppuratin,
so that I hope she will
not suffer much after a short time.
ah ! my dear Sarah we were near
losing her at the aweful crisis, I
never saw any one so completely in
the balance that recovered, most part
of her illness before that, is a blank
to her, which I wonder at, as she
seemed clear frequently - What
a kind, true, and helpful friend
in need is dear Betsy, I never
admired her so much - My
father is finely, his spirits getting
up again, he was greatly
cast down about Elizabeth and
much to be felt at that time
it made his deep wound bleed
afresh, but he is spared the second
trial, and I hope will be more
comfortable when Elizabeth's health
is re-established than before _
I suppose thou hast heard of
Anty's illness and that Mary
Brown is in her place, we hear
she is going on pretty well at the
hospital. -
My Uncle's health not improving, he
is mostly confined to bed, Doctor Davis
and Doctor Tomlison met last week
to consult about him, and their plea is
bleeding and blistering very much, he is
to be bled twice in the day, every few days
I have not heard particularly how
Edward was this some time, I hope he
is now quite stout, remember me to him.
Elizabeth desires me to say with her dear
love she is much obliged for the grapes, wh.
she enjoys greatly she keeps them to suck
at night and is so choice of them for that
she does not like to take one in the day
I send the listew shoes, I hope they are
the right size. If thou should want a
servant, I know an agreeable girl, who
lived at Carroll's, and has an excellent discharge,
I have not heard of any one Martha
Leadbeater would be likely to suit. -
5th day - Elizabeth continues rather better,
we may expect her recovery will be slow
she has rested pretty well these two last
nights. - Mary joins me in love
thy very affectionate
A Wright -
