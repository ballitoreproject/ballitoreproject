those. Have you ever heard any more of the Man who Swindled
my Man of War (but certainly not [underline]Man of business[/underline]) out of his money?
I shod. be obliged to you to make some enquiries of this matter -
Who do you think is gone to fight the Battles of his Country? - you
will never guess - no less a Hero than little Louis!!! he is with Sir
J. Duckworth on board the Royal George, & sail'd for the Mediterranean.
Sir John assures me in his last letter, that Louis shall receive the
same attention & encouragement, he would bestow on a Son of his own.
In return for all my Egotism, tell me all that
interests you, & those I Love & esteem at Ballitore.
My Daughters join me in every good wish, & I am
very faithfully & affectionately yrs.

What do you think of the attempt
to traduce the Character of our much injured Princess? I can scarcely
refrain from applying to her Slanderer, the words of Othello,
- "never pray more"!
I expect to stay here a Month or five weeks, & during that time my
direction will be at Thos. Allan's Esqr. Charlotte Square Edinburgh
afterwards at Coniston.
