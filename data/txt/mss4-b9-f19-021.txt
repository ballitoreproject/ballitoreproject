My dear Elizabeth
The Doctors' real opinion about Deborah is
she makes more
that she is better, [deletion]she is[/deletion] [insertion]she makes more[/insertion] water [deletion][/deletion] & has perspirations at night
The Doctor has allow'd her to leave off the digitalis for a while & thinks
the bandage necessary for her other complaint she is to go with A T
tomorrow to get it her legs dont seem at all swell'd she is very thin
but looks better & cleared than when she came, she rests very well
she is not so unwieldy & feels rather lighter, the good accounts of Eugene have
revived her spirits which were cast down about him but only for that very
good - I could not get any silk to match thy gown & try'd every place I could
think of all too light color'd. I intend to get the handboxes If thou want
more straw put it in them & send them home I could not get more
straw so cheap as the last. Eben & Deborah are going to town to take our
things to the carman I send thy cotton & teapot lid my fathers bellows &
steel, bellows 3/9 steel 1/8 teapot lid either 10d or 1s I forget. B Fayle told
me that poor Sam Grubb was very dull 2 ships were launch'd at
the Ringsend yesterday but we miss'd the sight Y. Braidman is in
town gives poor accounts of Maurice he is still in [unclear]prison[/unclear][unclear][/unclear]
