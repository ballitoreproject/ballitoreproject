The Retreat 18th. of 8th mo; 1776
My dear Cousin
As thou desired I would write to
thee, I take this oppertunity by Cousin Tommy Chandlee
(who accompanies the master this evening) to write
to thee.
The boys have gone in to the water
several times since thou went. I do not like going in.
I would be much obliged to thee if
thou would write me a letter the Master
is going, so adieu in great haste
I am &c &c
