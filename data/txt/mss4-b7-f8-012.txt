Dear Cousin,
I received thy very acceptable
letter last post I did not know that
that was the post day till a good
while after.
I do not mean to have our
letters after the manner of newspapers
but to write diverting stories
& verses & any delightfull things
whatsoever. I asked A. Mitchell
to write a newspaper & now he is
looking for paper to write it.
When I asked Aby for paper
he asked what it was for I told
him. & he called me silly boy.
Here goes to write the rest
of the story I wrote in the newspaper.
[embellishment]

The Death of a Shepherdess.
As he was one Day killing some
Worms that were near it, according
to his custom, a voice spake to
him to this effect, Be not so cruel
gentle Shepherd to thy once beloved
Amaranthe, for those very
worms are a part of her; or if
you do not believe your own eyes.
He had no sooner raised up the
stone, but whole Shoals of Maggots
came creeping from under
it, & these Words along with them:
Think no more of what I once was
but treasure up this in your
Mind. This is what Amaranthe
is at present Th[unclear][/unclear] must one
day be. These words made such
a Impression upon the Shepherd
that from that Day forward he bid
adieu to his flock, & gave himself
up what is to the Thoughts of Death -
A Riddle
In Youth exalted high in Air,
or bathing in the waters fair,
Nature to form me took delight
And clad my body all in white
My person small & tender waist
On either side with fringes grac'd
Till me that Tyrant Man espy'd
And dragg'd me from my Mother's side
No wonder now I look so thin
The Tyrant strip'd me to my skin
My skin he flay'd my hair he cropp'd
At head & Foot my body lopp'd
And then with heart more hard than stone
He pick'd my marrow from the bone
To vex me more he took a freak
To slit my tongue & made me speak
But that which wonderfull appears
I speak to eyes & not to ears
To me he chiefly gives in Trust
To please his Malice & his lust
From me no secret he can hide
I see his malice & his pride
And my delight is to expose
His follies to his greatest foes

All languages I can command
Yet not one word I understand
Without my aid the best divine
In learning would not know a line
The lawyer must forget his pleading
The scholar would not shew his reading
Nay Man my Master is my slave
I give command to kill or save
I grant 10 thousand Â£ a year
And make a beggar strut a peer
But while I thus my life relate
I only hasten on my fate
My tongue is black my mouth is furr'd
I hardly now can force a word
To
Greecebank
I die unpitied am forgot
And on some Dunghill left to rot
seald it with candy glue
