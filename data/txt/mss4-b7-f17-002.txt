My dear Nancy's affectionate letter was the more welcome as it
conveyed the intelligence of thy recovery. I wish thee to be careful of thy
health now that the winter seems to be setting in. I think it was well
thou had not set out on thy journey before thou took ill. I was anxious
about thee, [insertion]therefore the account [unclear]from[/unclear] thy [unclear]ill[/unclear] was doubly kind[/insertion] tho not at all aware of the extent of thy suffering [insertion]therefore thy account from thy [unclear][/unclear] was doubly suffering. Thou
& dear Betsy are mutually disappointed - I wish to hear about her, & whether
Samuel follows any business, &c. How the heart yearns after the
dear friends of early days, & how many interesting ideas are attached to the
remembrance of that time, which seen at a distance, appears more delightful
than probably it was then, & yet we had hearts to enjoy our
blameless pleasures! I do long much to have thee a while to myself,
but now it seems a pleasure which flies before me, & I find our little
proposed scheme of enjoying ourselves in this way must be referred to a
future period. I cannot ennummerate all the reasons, but believe me
they are sufficient. Our children got well over the measles, but little
Lydia suffers a good deal with getting her teeth, & appears more delicate
than we would wish her. I intend sending thee the verses which
Eliz: has copied, her writing does neither her nor me much credit, but
I hope the copy is correct. I also send thee a copy of dear Edmund Burke's
letter. His widow when we heard of her, lived at his seat at Beaconsfield,
where Sally called to see her, When she travelled with Sarah Talbot, & met
a very cordial reception. Thou never saw Juliet Smith I believe. She was

the wife of a Capt: in the 22d Dragoons who were quartered here in 1800. She
[deletion]was[/deletion] [insertion]is[/insertion] a very clever, accomplished, worthy woman, who has submitted to a reverse of
fortune with exemplary patience & cheerfulness. She brought her husband [deletion]£50,[/deletion]
£50,000. He was in affluence, but being in partnership in a Bank which failed,
was in the decline of life obliged to go into the Army for a livelihood. He
is as worthy & amiable a character as his wife, but not possessed of such penetration;
therefore fell a victim to the artifices of others, & his own want of
suspicion. - They have a large family: A married son, & I believe three
young ones, & three fine daughters, the eldest skilled in twelve different
languages. I have made another valuable acquaintance - In the
languages. I have lately made another valuable acquaintance - In the
hurry of the [insertion]Dublin[/insertion] meeting-time, a gentlewoman came late to the Inn, could get
no room but sat with contented sweetness by the kitchen fire - Wm.. heard of

her, & went for her bringing her to a spare bed here, ignorant of every thing about
her, but that she was weary & not like to get a suitable bed. We found she

was the widow of Col: St. George, the granddaughter of Chenevix the

respectable bishop of Waterford, & having an estate in this neighbourhood
was come to look after it; as it was a very [unclear]throng[/unclear] time at the Inn, & I was
going to Dublin Wm. offered her apartments here while she staid, & she
remained a few days after I came home, & has been since a while at the
Inn. She is not a [underline]wit[/underline] like Juliet, & in many things they are very unlike,
tho' both women of superiour abilities & acquirements - Melissina is an
elegant poetess, & possesses a captivating sweetness of countenance & manner
elegant poetess, & possesses a captivating sweetness of countenance & manners
springing from the soil of I believe a truly humble heart. She entered into
the interest of her tenants in every respect, got books for their children, &
I found her sitting in our scullery one day hearing them read their lessons.

when I remonstrated with her, she said she would not [deletion] go [/deletion] bring them into our
parlour, as she would not bring them into her own, & I had much ado to get her
out of the scullery - She possesses I suppose about £7000 p ann: & has but one
child a boy of 14 at Harrow-school, who refused a commission [insertion]in[/insertion] the army. She
was here when dear Molly Bewley died, & appeared to sympathize sincerely
with us. Her maid, who had been her nurse, a respectable woman, [deletion]told[/deletion] [insertion]gave[/insertion] me
many amiable traits of her character
Thou art very welcome to take a copy of the Tour, & to entertain any whom
thou chooses with the perusal of the letters. Do tell me thy dream. I beg [unclear][/unclear]
this to send by Anne Bewley, who went unknown to me. Now I hear of
an opportunity early to-morrow morning. It draws towards bed time, &
I have to write to ABewley. Thine in dear affection
I have to write to [unclear]ABewly[/unclear]. Thine in dear affection
