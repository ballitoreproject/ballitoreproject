Ballitore: 11th of 9th month 1814.
Though my dear Betsy has not favoured me with a letter yet, I
know there are as many others who of right come before me that I
wave all pretensions at present, & if thou writes not at all, the
living epistle of thy dear Self will answer all questions. Do not mistake
me I am by no means indifferent about getting a letter from thee.
Thy description of what thou said at [unclear]Adun[/unclear] would greatly enliven &
be acceptable to the Belfast Magazine & we might read it in print, &
our posterity after us. poor thing it wants a little enlivening. I believe
this is as pleasant, if not the pleasantest time thou ever spent from
home I think I foretold it, & thy own mind was also pre-occupied with
the idea that it would be so. In the year 1788 I was pretty much resolved
to accept the kind invitation of J & [unclear][/unclear] Harvey to pay them a visit, but another
plan counteracted it, & the fair occasion past by. However thou will
act a better figure there than I should have done.
We are much concerned at hearing that James Phelpps is ill of a brain
fever & that his affairs are much embarrassed. Perhaps the account
is exaggerated. I have had a letter from Abby Roberts who is much
pleased with thee, as are her sister, except Dolly, who was indisposed & asleep,
which seems to be considered a loss [insertion]to her[/insertion]. But why should thou misrepresent me, &
tell lies of thy poor aunt? A R says thou hast represented me in such a
manner that she deems me quite a Philospher. A character to which I
you [unclear]so may[/unclear], but have been from home a good deal, & have had many things to attend to. I have now to say
that I shall have great pleasure in printing & publishing the little [unclear]had[/unclear] [unclear]for[/unclear] gain, which can
only cost a trifle & I dare say will pay you very well your [unclear]latin in Collages[/unclear] have been
published in London & has met with pretty good success I am your sincere friend J.C.
I can put your MS to pup directly, there being nothing doing at the office. Now I think
Thou might as well do so, first enquiring the expense & will thou not cons with thy father?
13th May Aunt Chamber & a fat little grandchild with a maid all came, & James Cumming
who seems an agreeable well informed young man. Thy Aunt looks exceedingly well. I
suppose you looked out [unclear][/unclear] all day night at the marvellous sky. I have had a very nice
letter from Melessin this morning. She is at Cheltenham.
thine with a great deal of love which
I have with our dear friends
I have now to say
M Leadbetter

have less pretensions than most others. Our neighbour Coddington's family
are in much trouble. ACoddington's mother, the widow Bellingham a nice, old
gentlewoman, died yesterday morning. Fanny Burley has received account of
the death of her nephew Joseph Robinson, soon after he got home from this.
Ron Pary in great trouble, & cannot be got from the remains. Brother Chandlee
has had two fits these two last nights, thy Aunt poorly with a heavy
cold. The chincough in Winny Doyle's family, & the young child [unclear]Feanius[/unclear] Johnson
much indisposed. [unclear]Eleann[/unclear] Goodwin came home with her little boy. They
were 33 days on shipboard, short of provisions, & when they landed at Cork, she
thought best to set off directly - she looks thin, but is most fascinating with
her brilliant accounts of illuminations, glass, garters, Emperor, King & [unclear]Onnees[/unclear]
A treaty of marriage is on foot between Nat. Williams & Matty Wright. I
think they have waited well for each other, being a most worthy & amicable
pair. Michl L. Clarke & Sally Birkett I suppose will soon present. Robt [unclear]Tolerton[/unclear]
who married Anne Hudson (who was a thy father's a while) has one daughter
& one son I [deletion]hear[/deletion] [insertion]suppose[/insertion]. the daughter, a girl of fifteen, just came from [unclear]Ashannis[/unclear] school
we hear has eloped with a journeyman of her father's. Hannah Boake
has been very ill. She thinks she is in the family way - but this is rather
entre-nous - time will tell. Thy Aunt Chambers, with her grandchild,
maid & a brother of John Cumming are expected this day. Give my
love to Mary Taverner, Thomas's widow. I wish thou could get her to tell
thee about Saml Nottingham & his wife, American friends who lodged in
Youghall a while. I was greatly entertained by it. [insertion]She could tell thee about poor Wrightson he lodged at her father's in Mallow[/insertion] Wm Haughton has
returned from Dublin, or rather from Irishtown, when she had very

agreeable lodgings. She appeared to be much benefitted by the warm baths
but injured by the cold. On the whole I hope she is better. Josh. accompanied
her here, & Bancroft Wilson, who dabbled a little in chymistry & pastry during
his short stay with us. He was equally successful in both. Thy aunt Sally's
maid Hannah Fuller seems much the reverse of her brother Jacob, not partaking
of his vivacity & volubility, but does pretty well. Bess continues
semper est eadem - I am always afraid to quote Latin, as I suppose does
Matty. Kitty left Thos. Johnson's, & is at his uncle Duckell's on a visit. I think
she is a respectable young woman, ingenious, neat, & diligent, & I believe
would be an acquisition to a friend who wanted a housekeeper, who might
sit at meals with the family, which is a point with these girls, & not
from pride. Will thou mention her to friends where thou art? - from
she lived some years with Sally Strayman of Waterford, who
could be enquired of concerning her abilities &c. I had a pretty little [unclear]letter[/unclear]
from Melesinn, coming by way of Wm Lefance, undirected. She is the author
of the lines from a mother to her infant daughter in a later Farmer's Journal.
She mentions Sermons by Buchannan, the write of the Christian researches
in India, particularly one called "The [unclear]other in m last[/unclear]
-batim. Wm Lefann confesses that they returned by Limerick, & mentions
that they are going to Co. Wicklow, & enquires is there a road across the
country by which he could come here. His letter is to thy father. It is
long since I was favoured with a line from him.
How is our pet Jacob? Has he increased his stock of anecdotes? I hope
Joseph, Thomas, & James are well, & Thomas Fisher. Jas. Fisher is a very
fine youth.

Joshua Harvey as pleasant as ever. Wm Robinson I hope not worse. Joseph
Brown very sensible & very lame, which I think is by his pulling up the
heel of his shoe too soon. Stanton the old Priest of Carlow is dead. Wm Naughton
came to school here. I do not think I have seen Christy Dempsey since the day of his
wife's funeral. He has been much indisposed with downright grief I understand,
Sally Meares on a visit to her father with two little daughters, exhibited here,
looked fat & fair & well-dressed & appeared very happy. So be it!
If Mary J. & Sally W. write this day I mean to detain this in hope of an
expected frank, or of more news. In the mean time accept an overflowing
cup of love from all in this house & present it where due. Mayl. bathes
here almost every day, & I think looks much better, she has but little
thirst now I suppose. I got a letter from J. Cumming with a note for thee
which I thought is best to open & keep entirely to myself so thou need not mention it
in thy reply, & to send thee a copy of it not being able to get a frank.
[deletion]Miss[/deletion] dear Miss Shackleton I have to apologize for my [unclear]remisseness[/unclear] in not writing to
