Hanford, 9 month 8th 1791.

Dear Friend & Cousin,

	We were favoured with they very acceptable Letter to my dear Sarah, a few days before we set out for Dunkirk; she was not on the Appointment, nor any Woman Friend; but feeling a draft towards the Continent, she was encouraged to accompany me, as far as Dover at least: The Committee appointed by the Yearly Meeting, met at the close, with some of the Kentish Friends, & those from Dunkirk; & fixed the time for William Tuke, Adey Bellamy & myself, (all the names that were entered, with any other Friend who, with the consent of the Meeting for Sufferings, might be concerned to accompany us.) to be at London on Fourth day the 10th of the 8th month, or at Dover the 11th unless W. Tuke & I should happen to meet with Vessels at our neighbouring Ports of Hull & Pool to convey us to Dunkirk by the 12th or 13th -- this, however, appearing more uncertain than agreeing at once to meet & embark together at Dover, the latter was recommended before we separated; finding, accordingly, after my return home, that no Vessel passed regularly between Pool & Calais or Dunkirk, I wrote, that my Wife & I intended to be ready to proceed with those that went from London, at the time proposed, which we reached on Second day, the 8th. We found Adey Bellamy & Thomas Shillito, who had obtained consent of the Meeting for Sufferings, ready to receive us; but William Tuke & John Hoyland, who also had obtained consent, hearing of a Vessel to sail from Hull in about 10 days, had written to request that the time of meeting at Dunkirk might be protracted about 14 days: Friends in London did not find themselves warranted to comply with this request, as such alteration might prove inconvenient to the rest of the Committee, with all of whom it was not easy to consult; for besides those of the Yearly Meeting & Thomas Shillito, who only was on the spot, four were appointed by the Quarterly Meeting of Kent, resident in different parts of the County; viz. Richard Low & Thomas Beck of Dover, Joseph Elgar of Folkstone & John Chalk of Canterbury; it was considered that each must have had arrangements to make previous to leaving home, which the change might affect if it did not totally disconcert them; & after all a disappointment might happen about the time of the Vessels sailing from Hull; the Friends at a distance, therefore, were not consulted, but W. T. & his Nephew advised to meet us either in London or Dover; the passage from thence to Calais being generally performed in 3 or 4 hours & to Dunkirk in 6 or 8; (William Rotch & his Family, on their return, dined at Dover & drank Tea at home): be the time more or less, we should then have been together; but an answer was received that J. Hoyland could not be ready, therefore both declined coming; thus were we disappointed of their company: I felt sorry, -- principally on W. T.s account, who had offered himself, from good motives, I cannot doubt, independent of anothers concern, & being qualified for the Service, was approved of & accept by the Meeting; -- at the first it caused some discouragement, but we proceeded; & in the course of our engagement & at the close of it, someway, I trust, all of us were renewedly made sensible that the only sure dependance is, not one upon another, upon former experiences, or qualifications, whether of our own or others, but upon the Great Master wo worketh by whom he will, giving to every man his work, the Good Shepherd, who ^when he^ putteth forth, according to his gracious assurance, still goeth before the willing & obedient. he was pleased to be with us, & to manifest of his Goodness, at times, to the humbling of our hearts together; in so much that we may acknowledge, we had lack of nothing. By noting things simply as they occur, perhaps I may not sufficiently observe due order in the relation; my wife, I believe, would have done it better, had she been present with us throughout the Visit; but this could not be, though well convinced that her inducement was something more than curiosity, or even merely to accompany her Husband, yet, being under no appointment, she might therefore be considered in like situation with some others, who took this opportunity for the sake of the voyage & excursion professedly; a thing not foreseen by us, nor yet easy to prevent, had inconvenience been apprehended from it; as it was, particular distinctions could not be made without hazarding offence; hence the Committee found it expedient uniformly to proceed by themselves, without interference of others: -- Deborah Townsend of London (unknown to my Wife) had a concern to go; which was laid before the Meeting for Sufferings; but several there seemed to think that that Meeting was not authorized by the Minute of the Yearly Meeting to consent to a Womans going, altho it expressly saith -- any Friend -- others thought differently; she, however, was not forbid, -- but it prevented her: after this, my Wife could not allow her name to be mentioned there, whatever she might have done before; but her intention being generally known, no one thought it necessary, nor had any objection ^to it^ that I heard of; & the Committee desirous of her company kindly encouraged her; she accordingly went down with us to Dover on Fourth day the 10th; here we met with the Friends appointed for Kent, & those above mentioned; two of their Wives were there, but one only went, which (as Thomas Becks Wife could not, conveniently) I thought thought would make it more agreeable to mine; but, though she had not fully concluded before we came down, when it came to a point, I believe the want of a Female companion would not have prevented her, so strong was the cord: I think as she advances in years her courage & strength encreases, on the best ground; -- would it were assuredly so with me also! nevertheless I trust it is the happy experience of many; & altho, as hath been the case, more or less, in every Age & Country, many places are stripped, & become apparently barren, where the Truth once flourished; yet, may it now now be said that the Harvest truly is great -- yea, great as ever; & that the Lord of the Harvest hath been & is qualifying & sending fourth labourers; even the Good Shepherd, who said -- other sheep I have, which are not of this Fold; them also I must bring -- under the prospect thereof, I have at times felt desires (feeble -- may they be strengthened!) that more Labourers, faithful & willing, may be sent forth; though, sensible He can work how & in what manner he will; by many or by few; [passage crossed out] ^& also^ by the immediate operation of his Spirit in the Heart, without any outward or visible means, [word crossed out] -- He, whose power is not confined to time or place; who turneth -- a fruitful Land into a barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein -- can also make of a barren wilderness a fruitful Field; [passage crossed out] Let the Philosopher, the wise of this World, reason, -- the despot rage, -- & the Bigot be narrow & intolerant as he may; He is able & will perfect his Work; praised be his Name -- We staid a day at Dover to give full opportunity for our Yorkshire Friends to join us, if on further consideration, they yet inclined, which some seemed to hope they would; & we hired a Vessel for the Voyage purposely with sufficient room; but they did not come -- so we embarked on Sixth day morning, twelve in number, with a fair wind for Dunkirk, which favoured about an hour; but proving variable after & at length against us, we were at last obliged to put into Calais Harbour, about 10 at Night; several were sick, though my Wife & I escaped & the disappointment excepted, the Voyage was not unpleasant; finding the Gates shut, we continued on board till morning; when, gaining early admittance, we after a good breakfast at the Hotel de la cour de Londres, a civil House, we hired a Barge, & proceeded on a fine Canal ^or^ in-land ^navigation^ through a rich Corn Country, to Dunkirk, 13 Leagues, arriving about 9 at night, first at Benjamin Rotchs, where several Friends came to invite us to their Houses, being too large a company for one: They were glad to see us; the next being First day, we attended their Meeting for Worship at 11, the usual hour in the Fore-noon; & had one appointed at 6 in the Evening; a few Strangers came in: On Second=day morning the Committee met to read the Minutes & consider how best to fulfill the intention of the Yearly Meeting: We agreed first to pay a visit to each Family; six are settled, but one, consisting of a Man, his Wife, & Child were absent; another pretty large one is expected, the Master, who was there, intending to fetch them soon; & B. Rotchs may properly be deemed two, his Father, Mother & two Sisters living with him, having as yet taken no House, if determined where to settle; there were also several single Men our at Sea: We visited 4 Families that day; & the next W. & B. Rotchs; after which, was held a Meeting of Conference with the Heads of each Family, on Fourth day Morning the Committee settled a report; in the Evening we had the last Meeting with them generally, which was a solemn, favoured opportunity; & we parted in much love; having been brought, as expressed in our report, into near sympathy & concern for them, in considering their lonely & exposed situation; upon which having therein also given our sentiment, we leave their disposal to the judgment of the Yearly Meeting, not thinking it would be safe for us, though authorized by the minute, to determine what Quarter to unite them to: Having thus, in the ability afforded, executed our Commission, with unanimity & concord, to mutual satisfaction, we bid farewell to this part of the Flock and Family; and it is with thankfulness I may add, at the close of this account, that the Great Master, who had condescended to be with us, favoured us to look homeward with Peace: We had agreed with the Captain who took us over, to fetch us back again from Dunkirk; but he not appearing at the time proposed, we returned by land to Calais, & had a ready passage, of little more than three hours, from thence to Dover; here our Companions ^now-rendents [?]^ left us; my Wife inclining to take the benefit of bathing in the Sea; we staid a Week; which, together with the Journey, Voyage &c proved of great advantage to our Health, both being much better than when we left home; I observe thy enquiry extends to other parts of the Continent & the intermediate Isles, but we have had no information since we saw thee, save by a Letter from Nicholas Nastel of Guernsey to my Son; which brought an agreeable account of the few there: In France, the People were busy in their Harvest; the Crops on the ground appeared to be good; & notwithstanding the report of alarming accounts ^so industriously^ circulated in our publick prints, so far as we could learn, all things were quiet & peaceable amongst them; but my paper obliges me to be short on this head, which may be well, lest entering upon Politics I should go too far: Had I been aware of writing so long a Letter I should certainly have chosen a Larger sheet; the necessity of a Cover perhaps may be an inducement to my dearest & better Half to make an addition worthy of double postage; -- In dear love to thee & Cousin Elizabeth, to Your Sons & Daughters, each of your united Families, in which my Son joins, I conclude
	Thy affectionate Kinsman
