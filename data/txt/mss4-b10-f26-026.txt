Frankfort on Maine
8 August 1854
My dear Mother
We left London on Saturday
as I told you we intended in the steamer
for Oestend the day was wet & blowing
& we had a very disagreeable but not a
prolonged passage of 12 hours. Mary
Georgie & I very sick - Thos. & Emily finely
we were just going on board when
I heard somebody say "Mrs Henry" &
on looking round I saw Gabriel Fisher
bound for the same place so we had
him for a companion the only one we
knew & he staid with us until last
evening when we stopt [deletion]here[/deletion] at Cassele
to come here by railway & he stopt
at Mayence the opposite side of the
Rhine to go on by Manheim - We

slept at Ostend the night we arrived [deletion]here[/deletion]
and came on next day by railway to
Bonn on the Rhine - Slept there and
left it yesterday morning by Steam
boat in a mist so thick that we could
scarcely see any thing - however the day
cleared up & was most lovely and we
were all delighted with the scenery of the
far famed Rhine - I had not anticipated
that it would have pleased one so much
because having been up the Danube
I fancied them more similar than
they are except in one or two instances -
We came to a Hotel to which G Fisher recommended
us & find it very comfortable & not [insertion]so[/insertion] very
exhorbitant as the one at Ostend - Frankfort
is a beautiful town - & I suppose there are
many things worth seeing in it but as
Switzerland is our chief object this time
we do not stay longer in the towns than
we can help - we walked a good deal
through the town or I should say City - visited
a museum to see Danniker's famous Statue
of Ariadne & the Lioness of wh Richd - has a
small copy - and a Gallery of paintings
& left Frankfort at 1/2 past one for
Hiedleberg wh we reached about 4 oclock
the railway passing along a very pretty
country the whole way Hills about
as high as some of the Dublin Mountains
wooded to the very top every spot without
trees being covered with vines & here and
there very small patches of corn - At
Hiedleberg we went to a Hotel close to the railway
terminus to wh. the Frankfort Hotel keeper directd
us - it proved very good - in a fine situation and
very reasonable - when we had taken possession
of our room & washed & settled ourselves we
went out to explore until tea time as we
had lunched in the train - we visited the
Cemetery & then ascended a high Hill
over the town from wh. there are splendid
views from particular points on the road

up, wh winds through a wood of Spanish
Chesnut to the ruins of a fine old German
Castle or Schloss as they call it - from the
terrace of the Castle there is a fine view
of the town & river Neckar - and the ruins
of the town & River Neckar - and the Ruins
themselves are well worth seeing so curious
& so extensive is it - when we got back to
our Hotel we were pretty tired & in right
good humour for our Tea & Cutlets which
as well as bread & butter were excellent
& we did them ample justice - we went
to bed between 10 & 11 in very good beds
in very pleasant rooms & slept well
we were up this morning about seven
& were ready to start 1/4 before 11 by rail
for this place "Carlsrue" where we expected
letters from home and to meet Olivia
but neither are here yet it being
only the 9th of August & I believe Thos.
gave both you & Olivia to the 10th or 11th to
find us here so we are living in hope
we are taking advantage of the delay here
to get our clothes washed - we are comfortab

located [deletion]all[/deletion] but not in so romantic a town
or situation as [insertion]at[/insertion] Heidleberg - from Ostend to
Cologne we had to travel by first class
on the railway - as there was no other - but from
Cologne to Bonn - from Frankfort to Hiedleberg
& from Hiedleberg here we travelled 3 class
wh we found very pleasant neither annoyd
by dirt or rudeness nor [insertion]in[/insertion] any way - we see far
more of the people & foreign customs and
scarcely meet an English person wh is we
think quite an advantage - on board the
Rhine Steamer too we took places in the fore
deck - wh even if it cost as much as the
others we would greatly prefer - we were
attended by the second steward but we had
our breakfast on board - a special table
for ourselves (including G Fisher) clean cloth
clean napkins abundance of bread & butter
& tea [insertion]& coffee[/insertion] [underline]all[/underline] the best we got since we left
Glendruid for about 10d each wh also included
the waiter - we were in a far better place
for seeing the beautiful scenery through wh
we were passing & had great variety amongst
the country people who were as courteous &
as civil as possible - We are now going to try if Olivia

be in the next train from Baden & I do not
intend posting this until we see will we get
letters
Carlsruhe 10 August 1854
I am afraid
you will be scarcely able to read this the
ink from some cause or other is so bad
we went [insertion]yesterday[/insertion] as we said to the train but did not
find Olivia, so we returned to our hotel and
had our dinner & tea together & then went out
again to the Palace & Royal Gardens, the latter
being open to the public intending to pass
the time until the last train from Baden
again to try for Olivia however as we were
on our way to the Hotel we met Olivia
whom by some cross purpose we had missed
[deletion]for[/deletion] she had been here the last week & had
left a letter at the post office for us telling
us she was here, where she was to be found
& that she had beds engaged for us - but this
letter we did not get altho on arriving we
asked at the post office [insertion](which is at the railway station)[/insertion] for it - of course not
meeting her nor not knowing she was here
we went to another Hotel & arranged all
necessary matters until we should meet
Olivia or know what we were to do - we had
[deletion][/deletion] engaged beds & therefore had to stay where
we were - but today we found out that the Hotel
Olivia was at is kept by [underline]the nephew[/underline] of the person
who owns the Hotel we were at & that there
was no difficulty nor awkwardness in changing
& joining her - and we have done so - the one
we were at was one of the grand ones where
all the royal folk put up, consequently dearer
but we have as large [deletion]a[/deletion] rooms here and I
see no difference in the Beds wh is one of the
chief matters & we are to pay only about half
the price for them - the room in wh Thos & I are
to sleep & in wh I am now writing is as large
as Doctor Henry's front drawing room in Fitzwilliam
Square but not quite so lofty, it has five large
windows two at one side & three at the other
2 fine pier glasses a sofa a wardrobe - 2 wash
hand tables with cupboards underneath
an oval table in the centre with carpet under
it - carpets at sides of beds - stove chairs & 2
Gas lights in centre of room with three burning
but not Glass shades - every thing clean & nicer
than in most Hotels in England or Ireland -
We have received the expected letter from Lucy
and hope to get a larger epistle at Lugano

we cannot yet tell any other place to send
letters to us - but if you write immediately
on receipt of this & [underline]I hope you will not fail[/underline]
[underline]to do so[/underline] we can get it at Lugano I believe
[deletion]even if[/deletion] as I think this ought to reach you
on the 14th or 15th - I have not time to write a
second letter so will be obliged by your
sending this as soon after you have read
it as you can to Elizth or Richd that we
may hear from them & that they may know
how we are getting on - the enclosed letter for
Lucy you will send to her [underline]by very first[/underline]
[underline]post[/underline] if she have left you - I am so very
particular in those directions because the
hearing from home is such comfort to us
if it should so happen that letters were sent
to us to Lugano before this reaches you &
that you did not wish to write a second
letter - you might post a Saunders of the
latest day to indicate all were well & that
you had recd this after your letters had been
posted for us - but mind the margin of the
paper should be cut off leaving the stamp on
I got no letters the day we left London and am
