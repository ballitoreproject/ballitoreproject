My dear aunt
I am sure thou wilt sympathize
with us when thou hears' that
we have lost our dear little Lydia;
she had been very delicate ever since
she came from the Black Rock, but
appeared much better on 3rd day
last, was lively & had a good appetite,
she was fed as usual in the
night, & soon fell asleep after, however
when her maid awoke she found
our baby dying in her cradle, she
sighed once but never stirred, it is
thought it was a fit; her parents
feel this blow keenly but endeavour
to bear it calmly; they are
both poorly with colds & are
coming to spend a few days

with us. Deborah dreads being left
alone. We have agreeable accounts
from Marg[underline]t[/underline] she is still
at Robert Fayle's, under Carmichal's
care he has probed her back &
foot repeatedly, & now they are healing.
We sat in our new meeting
house to-day & had our preparative
meeting up stairs, it
was quite dry & comfortable.
I am much obliged by thy kind
remembrance of me, & assure thee
I often think of thee & wish for
thy return we sleep constantly
in thy bed & had company one evening
in thy drawing room. We have
parted with Nelly & got instead a
sister of Matty Conway who seems agreeable.
Thy aff[underline]te[/underline] niece E.L.
