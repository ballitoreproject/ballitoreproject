47 Basinghall st. London 1. 1. 1825.
My dear aunt,
Thy little note of the 14/9 mo.
of Joseph Humphreys, which I now acknowledge
by the same hand was very acceptable.
I wish thou couldst spare time to write to
me more frequently. Hast thou yet received
Prior's book? - I sometimes meet
him in the street. - he has invited me to
go out some evening & lodge at his house
at Brixton (about 4 miles hence) but
I am so busily engaged at present that
I know not when I can avail myself
of his kind offer. - He has been a
naval surgeon & though independent of
his profession, still continues a little practice
and 17/2 mo
Mary Leadbeater

In thy note thou expressest a hope for
Lady Theodoria Rice's recovery - it is rather
late to tell thee in reply that she is
now finely & has been for some time in
the country; - I expect to see her & her
husband in town in about a week - I
am still attending their son Stephen.
I was sorry to hear of thy late illness;
I hope thou hast got over it & takest
care of thyself. - I should be pleased to
hear particulars of thy intended publication
for the Education Society.
I find myself gradually getting into
employment in my new profession. - My
situation at the girls' school at Stoke
Newington is a very likely means of introducing
me very generally to the knowledge
of Friends; - while my engagements
with Spring Rice & Hardcastle afford a
reasonable hope of extending my employment
outside the pale of our Society. - I
lodge two nights in the week at Wm
Allen's & find him a very interesting
companion,- & enjoy his society too when
it is most interesting, - during his hours
of leisure & relaxation at his house in
the country.-
With love to uncle L-- Mary Doyle
& other friends at Ballitore
I remain thy affecte nephew
Thomas Fisher
