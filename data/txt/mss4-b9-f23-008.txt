3rd day night
Ballitore 3 mo 13th 1827
My dear Sarah
As Jenny Daley is going to
Dublin in the morning, I thought it would be
a nice opportunity of letting thee know how
poor Richard gets on - the Doctor has just been
here, and says he is doing well, and likes his
pulse, we hope there is no doubt of his being past
the crisis, though he still rambles at times, and
seems confused a good deal after sleep, which
may be partly attributed to laudinam, [unclear]he[/unclear]
has got occasionally to still the spasms, [unclear]of[/unclear]
which he has had a slight return to-day, and
last night, his stomach is much more settled
today, than for some days back he takes a
little wine, and this morning took a few
spoonfuls of flummery, at his own request
while I write Elizabeth has just come
in and tells me the glorious news of
his being in a perspiration, so that I trust
he is now quite out of danger with care [deletion]and[/deletion]
he has suffered much for want of it before or
rather I should say being too incautious himself -
yet down stairs - I sent Catherine Curtis last
week, I hope she may answer - Elizabeth sends
the poor mans plaister also a little pr of socks -
I did not want inclination so much as leisure to have
addressed thee sooner, my dear Sarah but to set me a
good example throw off the cares of the world for a little
bit, and tell me particulars about you all, first how
Edward really is, how you like your new abode, and be
sure not to forget to tell me all about my little friends,
has Margaret got shut of the deafness? &c &c
4th day morning - Richard got a good night, the perspiration
continued throughout, this morning early he took
a little sage, and since that some panada, and a cup of
tea, without any reaching. - Some of the boys are ill
at the school, they are afraid of fever - several were sent
home in consequence - In haste thy sincerely affectionate
I hope thou may not be [unclear]disappointed[/unclear]
in getting this, as I well know [unclear]the distance[/unclear] heightens
anxiety & suspense - farewell -
A Wright

Elizabeth sends her dear love, and to say she
would write, but that she is so much engaged
in different ways, I greatly fear she will be
overdone sitting up, and poor Betsy also
has gone through a great deal of anxiety and
fatigue - thy Aunt Sally finely but not
Thy father is getting up his spirits again,
though indeed he kept up wonderfully throughout
oh ! how his feelings have been harrowed up
again and again, but I hope and trust this
is the last trial of this kind he will meet
with
To be forwarded in haste.
