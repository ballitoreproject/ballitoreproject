O omit 269

From the same to the same
Sally wants one to fill her paper for her  but I would have her to know that my time is not always  no more than her time  I am not always in a mood for conversing even with a dearly beloved friend  But I may say that thine of 30th ultimate was a very acceptable pledge  the contents new  interesting & grateful - & deserving of a better return than I am likely to make at present. I know not when thou meanst to call on ^or^ to summon Sally  but she is in waiting - & I hope in measure prepared. May the Master, who sent forth two & two in the beginning, be graciously pleased ever to preserve you in a sense of your own utter insufficiency without him  from such a grounded sense will spring a salutary fear of doing, or not doing any thing whereby ye may forfeit that present aid so absolutely necessary in your stepping along  this sense will incite to give the praise to whom alone it is due, when there has been witnessed an overcoming, a rejoicing, & a triumph after victory  it will also tend to settle the mind in ^a^ quiet resignation to be nothing, when a death-like incapacity is experienced  knowing, that as ^it is^ the kingdom & government of Christ, which his servants have in commission from him to promote among mankind, so from him only cometh the right ability, & to him only belongs the praise  Thine is the kingdom, the power & the glory,  Tell my beloved Peggy that (as far as I know) we are all favoured at present with tolerable health  health, [page number 270 in grey] tranquility & the means of a comfortable subsistence are great favours from the bountiful hand of Providence  I would be glad if Peggy got out among us, if it were the Lords will- & if it be his will, he is able to make a way for it. Best Wisdom dwells with Prudence  consequently neither of them turns the other out of doors  My wife joins me in affectionate salutation to thee & thy husband. Our children all love thee.
Farewell,
Richard Shackleton
