Esteemed Friend
As Costello, has resigned up his
Land, and I hear there are several bidding for
it, and there is none of them in more need of
a few Acres than myself. I most humbly
beg and hope that thee and Wm Leadbeater
will obtain for me 2 Acres only Just what
would keep me in povision, and give Shaw
to Keep the House in Repairs. Whatever Rent
the Lady thinks well of Charging me for 2 Acres
opposite Owen Dunns door I will pay, that
is the only part would answer me for it is the
most convenient and I would wish to have
it by the Road, for the sake of improvement
There is about 12 Acres in the Whole
and

and by giving me 2 there would remain
10 Acres to go with the House Costello is in -
the House that I have is near as good as any in
Ballibarney, and 2 Acres of land with it would
be of the greatest service to me, were it only to
give Shaw to Thatch it, with respect of paying
Rent for two Acres it would be much easier
for me to pay Rent for four Acres than to be
buying Provisions every Year - Mr. Trench has
told Thee and Wm. Leadbeater he would let me have
a few Acres, and I hope by your kind application
to the Lady and Wm. Trench they will be good
enough to let me have 2 Acres only -
Ballibarney
