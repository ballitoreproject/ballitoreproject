Dear Cousin
R. Shackleton /
	My last (I believe) informd thee that Cousin Anna Geldart, tho still very feeble, was a good deal better than when thy Father saw her at Airton, she continued so for sometime, but grew, of late, weaker & weaker  My Husband saw her a few Weeks ago she was then poorly I heard much the same Account, upon [illegible] Enquiry since, but on 7th Day last Robert Parkinson a Friend from Gargrave told me he was at her Funeral last 6th Day  I have seen nobody from Airton very lately, nor heard any thing of her Death, before Robert told me, I doubt not but its a happy Change for her. My Brother has had a most severe fit of Illness his Recovery ^was^ unexpected by all who saw him. for some it was supposed to be partly occasiond, or at least, heightend by the Distress & Trouble of Mind he had for some time been in on Account of his embarrassd Affairs & other perplexing Circumstances attending his miserable situation, being daily almost put upon doing things which tho he was sensible woud tend to his Ruin he had not the Courage & Resolution to resist & refrain from on his Recovery we used our utmost Endeavours to prevail with him to put his Affairs entirely into the Hands of Cousin Morris Birkbeck Dr. Sutcliffe & T. Tindall Junior. who had kindly offerd to take the Trust upon em, we got him to do it but just in Time for if he had not taken such a step I believe he had been now in a prison, I believe hope his just Debts will all be paid but very little to spare, to give thee a Detail of all the base Art practicd upon him by his Wife & her Family wo[uld] require a Volume rather than a Sheet, they are so enraged at this offer of my Brothers which in part frustrates their [hole in paper] Designs (& but in part, perhaps, for tis strongly suspected there ^is^ in some hands a considerable Reserve of his Effects) that nothing can equall the gross abuses bestowd by them on poor John, his Trustees, & us for advising him to it, & even Friends in general known & unknown to em  however he is now well recovered both in Health & in his capacity (indeed they had used him in so outrageous a manner that he was quite distracted for some time) he & is ^now^ at Liberty to attend a Day school which I hope he will now more diligently apply himself to than ever having nothing else at present to depend on which perhaps will be no disadvantage for to him but rather a spur to his Industry  Cousin Birkbecks promise him their Interest in recommending him to something better when it falls in their way, they were ^in part^ sensible long ago into what bad Hands he was fallen & have now at the last stood his Friends & extricated him out of his Perplexities or I know not what woud have comed on him; he is at times a poor dejected unhappy creature still & his Case much lamented by many both Friends & other here  Ive dwelt perhaps too long on this subject but tis near my Heart & I cant describe what Ive sufferd & felt for him, poor unhappy youth  on various Accounts  my Sister Sally is still at Settle with Cousin Morris Birkbeck  Our little Family is mercifully favourd with the continuance of good Health  I should be very glad to receive a Line from any of you when Leisure & Freedom permits  Please to give my very dear Love to thy Father Mother & Aunt Barnard  also to thy sister Rayner of whom I often think & coud be glad to hear how she is  Time will not allow me to transcribe this wretched scrawl & I have been so often interrupted & that I fear twill be scarce legible  I hope thoult excuse all Errors  I am with dear Love to self spouse & Children thy very affectionate & respectful Cousin
