My beloved friend,
        I am long in debt to a long, intelligent, interesting, kind letter of thine, but I trust we do not want these outward visible signs to stir up the inward, spiritual grace of religious fellowship  yet I like now & then to exchange such pledges of renewed amity & love. If Iron sharpeneth Iron, & a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend, why may not this kind of communication also sharpen the inward sense, & quicken our best & purest feelings? And yet tis under the covering of a degree of fear that I venture to break in upon thee & interrupt thee in thy present ^arduous^ engagement,^+^ for it is indeed the Lords business & his errand which thou are sent upon. Those who are employed as thou art, feel themselves in an awful situation  So felt Jacob, when he said, How dreadful is this place! this is none other but the house of God, & this is the gate of heaven  So felt Moses, when it was said to him, Draw not nigh hither, put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place wherein thou standest is holy ground. And indeed the more this weighty, solemn sense is kept to & under, the deeper the labour will be, & the greater reach it will have on the minds which are the subjects of it. That which is ponderous sinks down to the bottom; but that which is light floats lightly on the surface, & is soon carried away. May thy dwelling, my dear friend, continue to be deep  mayest thou be content with any sort of habitation, [page number] 136 so it be thy proper home & centre  & mayest thou be crucified more and more to that spirit which in religious services wants to know any thing save Jesus Christ, & him crucified! When thou hast a little respite & leisure, & finds a liberty to converse with a poor friend, I shall be pleased to hear how thou gets on  for we are nearly interested here in what concerns thee.
        My wife & I & son & daughter S.S. John & Sally Watson, & James Leeky have been paying our family-visit in this monthly-meeting  We did not all stick always together  our band broke up a few days ago, & we returned to our several homes. I thought best help was often graciously administered, & the two Watsons pleased me much by their beautiful stepping along in the lively exercise of their valuable gifts. Our S. S. now & then anointed the wheels of our carriage as it went along, preserving it from the rust of Formality  how beautiful is Form when animated by Power! Go on & prosper, beloved friend! My wife joins me in cordial attachment to thee  my children hold thee in their best affections. Our dear love to thy help-mates, be they who they will  if they help thee, they do a kindness to us.
        Dearly farewell
                Richard Shackleton
