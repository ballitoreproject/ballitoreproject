My dear Mollys affectionate rememberance was very
grateful to me, (but why "[underline]Presume[/underline]" to the pilgrim & his partner in thy
concluding lines?.) The sight of our much lov'd friend from Ireland
was truly reviving, tho we were favourd with but little of their
company at our lodgings, Dear R & S. Grubbs excepted, who's quarters
being [insertion]nearer[/insertion] to us, our precious S.G. ofter calld in, what pitty thou did
not come with them. Several remarkd they had not known a more
favourd yearly meeting. James Thornton paid [underline]our[/underline] meeting an acceptable
little visit _ dear S. Watson can answer all questions when
[insertion]you [/insertion]meet, on this subject, so may refer thee to her _ I'm sorry her stay in
London was so short. Thoul't be pleasd to hear there's a
probability of [underline]my[/underline] Country men going [insertion]fellow[/insertion] passengers with thy Country
women _for I understand J.T. has made some enquiries respecting
the time of their movement, what pleasant ship mates
there will be - & how happy would G & D have thought themselves
if it had been their lott to have accompany'd them- But we endeavour
not to repine_ there can be but a few more years for
us on this side of the grave, & if my GD is mercifully kept in the
way of his duty, it matters little where his time is spent_ He
is gone to Colchester 2. Meetg. accompd. by his Bro. W. Dillwyn
& possibly may have service else where before he returns_
Do endeavor to cheer thy frd. A Sparks_ her sisters leaving [insertion]her[/insertion] must
feel hard_but then let her remember its in a good cause she embarks
& doubtless will be [unclear]divinely[/unclear] supported _ If they once reach
America, They will meet with many [deletion]kind[/deletion] sympathising kind
friends, who will endeavour to accomode her as well as they can_ its
true in some places [deletion]thee[/deletion] it wd. be dangerous to take a 2.wheeld carriage
no Turnpikes - but then our saddle horses are sure footed &
go very easy - perhaps her health may be mended by the triage - how
clever that the Honest good creature Jane Watson is permitted to
be her companion

If my GD should be obligd to visit you personally (I say obligd
for his mind often visits you [insertion]in[/insertion]volentarily) thou may depend on it Shall
throw no Bars in the way - but cheerfully go with him, should
he ask me - yet I know not that it will be- I should rejoice
to see thy goog mother - Mother Ell thy Br. & Sisters & many
others, that I've great reason to love, & none much more than
thy own dear self, who has done me many kind offices_does
thou continue to read a chapter every night, it's a good practice.
I think I was in company with [unclear][/unclear]Thomson in Dublin, an amiable
character - my mind freely assents to what thou so feelingly expresses on
the loss of such friends - several very dear ones, to me, have been finally
removd since I left home - Poor H. Haughton- she usd to look still
more delicate than her sisters, that have so lately been taken away from
her - do give my love to her - also to dear Jane Haughton - who was sorry
to hear is in such a distressd condition with her Jaw_ If she was in England
I'm ready to believe she might get curd, if under the care of one
George Botts -Dentist- a man of good character & a friend_I mentiond
to him, (happening to be in [insertion]his[/insertion] company) her havg. two or 3 teeth drawn, He
thinks the jaw bone is broken. He said the Surgeon had given over
a person in like situation, He was calld in, & performed the cure by
extracting the bone, & making way for the gathering to [unclear]discharge[/unclear] &
itself_ Doubtless her generous good husband is grievd to see her lingering
& would be willing she shd. have help even at this distance if not
to be had nearer to them_ Should thou inform them of the above
dentist, & they wish ti hear his direction, B. WD can satisfy you
He thinks him one of the compleatest persons of that profession in
England_ G.B. does not live in London, only comes once a year to
the meetg.- his patiens go to him-

an American correspondant) none more fix’s in the esteem and

President Washington stopt one night in the
city of Philad". The 20th of last month on his way to New York [unclear][/unclear]
upon him the important trust to which he has been unanimously
elected, - a great parade attended his Entrance, so much contrary
to his inclination, that he intended to avoid it, & to prevent a
repetition of it, slips away from the city nest morning in the most
private manner he could, which disappointed their Military
men, who had not time to collect.
The rects. &c thou last sent me were acceptable, as indeed are
all the pieces thou hast obliged me with - had thou come over this spring
I intended thou shd. have pickd & chose from my little stock, tho there
might have been nothing new for thee. The inclosd will not add
much to the postage [unclear]should [/unclear]this sad scrawl miss the friend its intended
to go by. There was so many talking in the room when I last
wrote thy dear Br. that I made a mistake in the name of Sam.l Marsh's
wife - it's not Jurney - but Gunn - I believe however its of no
consequence. I'm at A bellamys for a day or 2
