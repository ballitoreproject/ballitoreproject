I have felt much sympathy with my dear Brother & sister
since I received the affecting account of the removal of your
sweet little child, a sympathizing pang of heart-felt sorrow
which you need not have described to you; for although I never
beheld the beloved object farther than in idea, yet I loved him
dearly: he was the age of my own sucking babe & in her I thought
I beheld him: they are indeed uncertain enjoyments; & so are
all visibles - may every humbling dispensation of unerring
Wisdom have the happy effect of weaning our minds therefrom,
& [deletion]excite[/deletion] excite us to seek fervently & diligently after
the possession of that treasure, in which there is no disappointment:
& let this reflection bear up our minds under all
the chastisements of Providence, that, "Whom the Lord loves he
"rebukes & chasteneth every Son whom he receiveth; & if we
"endure chastening, he dealeth with us as Sons: for what Son
"is he whom the Father chasteneth not?" & again, the Apostle
was very sensible that "no chastening for the present [insertion]cometh to be[/insertion] [deletion]is[/deletion] joyous,
"but rather grievous; nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the
"peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them unto them which are exercised
thereby." Many pass through this life seemingly easy to
what others do, & outward things seem very prosperous to them;
but now matter what may fall to our lot, if we have an interest
in the everlasting Father, & never-failing friend; if we are made
sensible that we are his children, & that he deals with us according
to the good pleasure of his Will, for our refinement &
qualification

for more & greater degrees of his favour communicated
to our immortal souls: this is what is worthy our pressing after:
& Oh, may we obtain the prize! - I am [deletion]assured[/deletion] pleased to find
the other dear children are recovering so well: it is cause of thankfulness
that you were not deprived of either of them, as they
were farther reared, & their little minds beginning to expand,
& understandings open. I hope I shall soon hear again from
you how they are - my children are at present pretty well: I
was in a great strait what to do about getting them inoculated;
but before I received Sister Mary's letter, had given it up for
the present, as neither my Husband or I could feel liberty enough
in our minds to proceed in it; though I feel at times some anxiety
about them on that account, as they are advancing in life, &
capable of entertaining us with their innocent discourse, especially
Abram & Anne; we take them, [insertion]both[/insertion] to meeting, & they behave
pretty well there: they are now at school, & the little ones out,
taking the air; so I seized the quiet opportunity of saluting
you with a few times, just to express what I have felt for you,
having been sorrowfully affected by the account of your loss,
both by day & night: & yet it is small to what many meet
with, & to what we may experience; therefore it is well not to
suffer it to prey upon you; but as you acted to the best of your
understanding, to endeavour to be resigned to what has happened,
as it is a distemper that has been permitted to take off hundreds
in the natural way-- My husband joins me in affectionate
salutation to you & Cousin Sally & remain your Truly affectionate
