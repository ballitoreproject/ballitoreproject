	My dear Child,
		We leave our large family, and great Charge, not for any private, temporal gratification, (which yet, at times, might be lawful,) but from as firm a persuasion as our state, &c. admit and require, that it is our duty, both private and reltaive, to go to these solemn assemblies, in order to worship our great Benefactor, to whom such homage is in all reason due, and to lend a hand or heart to help forward the general good of our community, in exciting to their religious duties. On this solemn account we go. We leave thee, dear child, at home, expecting they care and assiduous assistance in our absence. I trust thou wilt not deceive or disappoint us in these hopeful expectations which we have formed of thee. I often bow the knee of my soul in prostrate gratitude to the Father of spirits, on account of the pleasing prospect which his goodness has afforded me of you, my dear children, being likely to embrace the offers of his merciful visitations to your tender minds. Prize them, I entreat and charge you, as your chief treasure: cultivate that field, and it will yield you a plentiful harvest, even the crop of all necessary, present benefits; “and what is infinitely more valuable, of eternal life. Be sober, dear child, be vigilant against a crafty enemy; love retirement, practise it; feel after something that is supernatural, to help, preserve, and comfort thee; and thou wilt grow from one degree of grace to another, and in favour with God and good men.”
							R. S.
