Oh! my dear Eliza I cannot
express to you [underline]my feelings[/underline] on
hearing your letter read this
morning!! Emy run up with it,
to me & we both cried [deletion][/deletion]
[deletion][/deletion] heartily over it -
oh! we are thankful that it is
over, & our prayers [underline]will now[/underline] be
[underline]that it may succeed[/underline]!! - How
could you write so soon after
the terrible pain? - but I know
you [underline]made[/underline] the [underline]exertion[/underline] to [underline]ease[/underline]
[underline]our[/underline] minds, shewing amidst all
your anguish, thoughtfulness for
others - - We were very anxious
for this morning's letter, after Saturday's
one, telling us of the intended
operation, & Emy & I were regretting
that you had not [underline]one[/underline] of us to be
with you, & you so far away
from all of us - but the Doctor's

& Catharine's kindness must have
been very comforting! - -
We had a large Party here yesterday
all interested about [underline]you[/underline]
& reading your letters - Edward
dined here amongst the rest -
which rest consisted of all [insertion]of[/insertion] [underline]us[/underline],
Francis & our four children F G Jr
& Eliza Jacob - - Isabel is [deletion]at[/deletion] still
at Dunlavin & will remain a
week or two longer - - My Mother
seems finely, except for that soreness,
but Emy & Etty says "it is better
than it was" - My brother Frederic
looks better than when I saw him
last, & seemed in good spirits - - It
was pleasant to [underline]me[/underline] to meet them
all, but I missed [underline]you[/underline] at our
family gathering!! - - I suppose Emy
will tell you all news, I have none.
but wished to put these few lines
in hers, to let you know my dear
Eliza, that altho' not near you, you
have the heartfelt wishes & prayers & love
of your aff Sister Lucy - My dear love to Thomas

We will be anxiously wishing for your next letter saying how
you are
getting on.
