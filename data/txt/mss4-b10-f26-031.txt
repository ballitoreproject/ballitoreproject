I was there when here before I have not the slightest
wish to go again - I hate crowds & railway crowds particularly
Emy & I are going out to post this - leaving Thos. in bed
but I am not uneasy at doing so as he seems better &
is chiefly indulging to try & ensure being well enough
for our journey tomorrow - I have been greatly
pleased with the beautiful flowers in the public Gardens
and Flower Markets - but the price of [underline]good[/underline] flower seeds
here is enormous so that I must do without
getting any - I went to a seed shop last evening
I could not get a small packet of choice
Carnation containing only one kind for
less than 2 or 3 Francs & some 5 Francs
so I did not get any as I think in London they are not so
dear as that & that perhaps I might do better even in Dublin
as the nursery men give smaller quantities wh. would suit
my purse better - but the Irish know nothing of the love of Flowers
in comparison of the French or even the English - In hopes of
seeing you ere another Sunday & with dear love joined by Thos.
& Emy to all the home circle I am my dear mother your affect
daughter EHenry
