The returning soldier
The wars they are over, & now I am come
Thus far on my way to my own native home,
Three & twenty years past since I saw the loved shade,
Three & twenty years past [deletion]like[/deletion] since I left my sweet maid.
In somersetshire with my Jenny so fair,
So tight, & so neat could no damsel compare,
We parted - alas, twas a sorrowful scene!
Our ages the same, in the bloom of nineteen.
O soldier, thy [deletion]cheek[/deletion] brow is defaced by a scar,
Thy weather beat cheek speaks the hardship of war,
Thy Jenny no longer with rapture can trace
The charms once so prized of thy form & thy face.
Though Time may have ravaged the graces of youth,
She shall find undecay'd my affection & truth.
And her heart like my own is unchanged & sincere
Then cease this foreboding, I've nothing to fear.
Oh soldier thy bosom anticipates joy
Yet those feelings [unclear]correct[/unclear] which themselves may destroy.
For [deletion]Yet[/deletion] though Jenny may met thee with pleasure & pride,
From [insertion]so[/insertion] [deletion]her[/deletion] alter'd [insertion]a[/insertion] form will thou not turn aside?

[deletion]For think[/deletion] [insertion]expect[/insertion] not that o'er her wan cheek shall be spread
The lily's clear lustre, the rose's [deletion]soft[/deletion] [insertion]pure[/insertion] red,
The rough hand of Time has pass'd over her brow,
Thy memory could scarcely acknowledge her now.
No more! - If [unclear]thy[/unclear] heart be addicted to range
Leave judging of [underline]mine[/underline], for it never can change.
I loved not my Jenny's fair outside alone,
I loved [insertion]more[/insertion] that [deletion]pure[/deletion] mind that so bright through it shone,
On that spot where we parted there still does she stay,
Her steps like her thoughts not permitted to stray.
O'er seas & o'er land 'twas my fortune to roam,
Yet still that lov'd spot was my heart's dearest home,
Yes we'll meet like true lovers, & doubt as you will,
In the eyes of each other be beautiful still
