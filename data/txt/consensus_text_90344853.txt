Papa went out to Fassaroe.
after tea - Uncle Frances
dined here.
13th.. Another fine morning.
Margt went to meeting but
staid at home, Papa came
in at about 12 O'clock, I had
a scrap of a note from Polly,
in which she told me we had
been invited to tea at Obelisk Park
on fifth day evening but as
that was to be the pic nic day
Mama sent a refusal.
Margt and I set off on John's
car again at about ten intending
to go to see Aunt Lydia, [unclear]true[/unclear]
on our way, we saw her
in a car, and consequently
our visit out have been useless,
so instead Margt called to
see Rebecca Eves, and Sally
Woodcock, while we were there
