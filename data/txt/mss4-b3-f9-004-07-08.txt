From Richard Shackleton to Richard Jacob.

Dear Richard,
	I received thine of 16 ultimate which I took kind. Thy brothers & cousins are, through mercy well. My daughter Peggy has ^been^ much indisposed, but has recruited finely. Health is a valuable blessing which is ^often^ not sufficiently prized, till the want of it is experienced. I wish thou may take care of thine, as thy constitution is but delicate. Be sober, be temperate, it is good for mind & body. Temperance is an excellent virtue: it consists in a dominion over our passions & inordinate affections: this predominating, we are cool & quiet, not rash & hasty, we see things in a just light, & act steadily & deliberately. Thou are the eldest, dear Richard, of a numerous flock: thy prudent stepping before them may be of great service: the example of youth has great influence on youth, & it is exceedingly beautiful to see the eldest child of a family by his wise walking mark out a track which the younger may safely follow through life. This virtue, these good consequences can only be attained by religion: & if we would be religious we must be humble. Humility is the stock upon which every christian [sic] virtue is engrafted, if it ever thrives aright, & is of any permanent duration. Let therefore, dear child, a consciousness of thy own unworthiness of the manifold mercies & favours which the liberal hand of Providence hath heaped upon thee, weigh thee down into true humility, where thou wilt be fitted to receive those consolations [?] & instructions [page number] 166 which will be thy effectual help, support & guide through this perilous & uncertain state of existence. I heartily wish thee well on thy way, having particular attachment to the welfare of thy fathers house. My family salutes all yours with much affectionate regard
		Thine
