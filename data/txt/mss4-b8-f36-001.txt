Athy Monday 19th Octr 1818
My dear Sir
You have been apprised by My Sister's letter
to our [unclear][/unclear] friend Mrs. Ledbeater of our irreparable
loss in the death of my [unclear]poor[/unclear] dear Father: And I
know well how deeply & feelingly you both could be
with us in the visitation with which it has pleased
the Almighty to afflict us. The circumstances in
which as to [unclear]pecuniary[/unclear] matters My Father died, or
even whether he made a will we are ignorant of.
This latter circumstance however is comparatively
immaterial as so far as I am concerned his
wished shall be fulfilled to the utmost. This
gratification must now be substituted for that
I had fondly expectant from a protraction of his life
& if I have any prosperity before me in his enjoyment
of it - I could not bring myself to go to Ballitore
yet: and indeed it may be that I have no
particular interest there, but on behalf of those
that may be interested I beg your kind & friendly
advice concerning his property in it, & may I add

your [deletion]present[/deletion] care of it for the present - Should I
have any [unclear]content[/unclear] I would in order to improve
the income & consequently the comforts of my
poor Mother & the other dear objects my Father
has left behind him endeavour immediately
or in the Spring to [unclear]recrut[/unclear] the old House under
your advice - But what particularly calls us
it is pressed upon me for immediate attention
is the ground out of Lease - Would you have
the goodness to say by return of post what
you think best to be done with it, and the
expense. May I before I conclude entreat
of Mrs. Ledbeater who so long & so well
knew my beloved father to assist us with
some tribute to his Memory, for I should
reproach myself if I were to allow him
to sink into the grave without any public
notice of his virtues, tho' I would have the consolation
to think that they had memorials in the hearts
of all those that knew him - We join in the kindest
regards to you [unclear][/unclear] & family - And I shall ever
remain yours most truly A[unclear][/unclear] Wills

For
William Ledbeater Esqre.
Ballitore
