Woodbank 10th Month 26th - 1818.
My dear friend
I received thy last letter to me
(when in Limerick). dated the 6th of last month
Thou wast[deletion]not [/deletion] right in thinking that I would [insertion ] not [/insertion] be
disappointed in my anticipated enjoyment of my visit
to the North - agreeable society, the beauty of the
country, the industry of comfort of the poor - every
thing[deletion][/deletion] forces me to enjoy the time which I
spend here. If I can, I think I shall spend
a long visit hither next summer, that I may
see the country to more advantage & have more time
for seeing what I wish to see. Yesterday evening I
returned from a journey which I took with my uncle
& aunt Dawson, and their son Edward to Belfast. On
our way, we stopped at Lisburn, & visited a few friends
there, among them, William & Mary [unclear]Hanerck [/unclear], their father
& sister Betsey had [deletion]at [/deletion] before that time, left home. We got in
to Belfast about half after seven, & after ten, my
uncle & I went to see Margaret Henry & her brother
William who was well, & who invited us to breakfast
the following morning, which we gladly accepted. My aunt
& Margaret spent the greater part of the day together shopping
while my uncle, Edward and I went to see the town we

visited the Belfast Academical Institution which is an establishment
[deletion]in[/deletion] consisting of various departments of Educat[unclear]clusuial[/unclear]
commercial, collegiate, to be under the care of
different Professors. We arrived there just in time on
7th day last, to see a sort of examination held [deletion]weakly[/deletion] [insertion] weekly
in the Common Hall where all the students belonging to the
different professors assemble together They amounted to about
200. We there heard two of the [deletion][/deletion] [insertion]students[/insertion] recite a pretty long
dialogue in French with scarcely any error or hesitation,
& another lad read a Latin essay of his own composition.
We remained there about an hour & were very much
pleased with it. We afterwards went to see a manufactory
for the spinning of cotton, in which all the machinery is
worked by a steam-engine. We thus spent the day very
agreeably. We left Belfast the next morning about 8 o'clock
& arrived in Lisburn at half past 9. We breakfasted at
Sally Bancroft's, & dined after meeting with William & Mary
Hancock, with both of whom I was very much pleased.
We left Lisburn immediately after dinner & arrived here
about 8 yesterday evening. - I admired the view of the
country very much during our journey but especially between
Belfast & Lisburn where it is in a high state of cultivation
&[unclear] interpressed [/unclear] with a great number of elegant houses,
& fine plantations, which are great ornaments to [insertion] such [/insertion]a hilly
country. [deletion] an [/deletion] I was very much gratified with the appearance
of comfort & industry [deletion] which [/deletion] in the cottages of the poor, who
in their industry & moral character bear a great resemblance
