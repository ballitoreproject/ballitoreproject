My dear Elizth
Mary Byrne who takes
this call'd here to day & alarm'd
me about my aunt Lydia saying
that Edw Allen had got a letter
from Betsy which told that my
aunt was keeping her bed, I would
be very glad to hear particulars
I hope she is not very ill M B
means to stay a day in Ballitore
Winny came duly to hand on
7th evening I hope she wont have
long to wait - I saw D Johnson
to day she seems to have quite
recover'd her health & was able
to walk to Kingstown yesterday

she is much obliged to thee for
thy messages of Tommy's health
Betty Doyle has got into
a very good place & I am very
glad of it she would not have
answer'd for me, I am in no
hurry to get any one till Winny
goes besides there are so many
plans floating in my brain
that I must settle on one
before I introduce any strangers
here - Bess Harvey went
or intended to have gone to
Rhuban's presentation which
I suppose is to be on 4th day next
she is a gay little woman
& often calls to see me
the children are very well
Johnny still chuses assistance
in walking tho' I think he is
very well able to go alone.
Magt sends his love to aunt
Elizth & bids me say that she is
a good girl, how are you all?
I hope thou'lt write by M Byrne
thou may, be sure of having
the earliest news we can
give of ourselves - ever thy SB
