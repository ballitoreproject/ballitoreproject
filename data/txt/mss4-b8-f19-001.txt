Dublin 21st June 1820
Dear Friend
Wm. Leadbeater
That I did not earlier reply
to thy favor of 9th Inst. has partly arisen from my
seeking to get information respecting the place in
East Street in which thou art interested. & more strongly
from the painful necessity I am under of acknowledging
that I am unable to afford thee any relief. - My
Property has vanished. - However my enquiries respecting
the house, enable me to inform thee that thy
offer to give up possession without puting thee to
the Cost of ejectment. - & I expect [deletion]that[/deletion] [unclear][/unclear] the
times a little setled, that a tenant might be got
for it, without diminution of Rent. - It does
however require to be immediately looked after
to prevent further delapidation.
After saying this much, what more can
I say. - I remain thy friend

Dear frd
Jno Bewley
I mentioned fully in a former letter what I thought respecting
thy holding in East-street. Nothing has occurred since to make me alter
my opinion. I could not with the least degree of convenience at this
distance undertake the care of these concerns, & it still appears to me to
be thy proper business to look after, & to take them into thy own
hands, repair them, & let them - thou acknowledges to me that thou
thinks them well worth the rent, & therefore it cannot be unreasonable
in me to expect to be paid it. People of every description I believe have
felt the shock of the times - I know I am among the number of those
that have & has had several very severe losses
thy frd
