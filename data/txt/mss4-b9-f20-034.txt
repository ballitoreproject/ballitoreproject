8th Mo 1828
My dear E- I could not get any braid
except silk which would be at all
all fit to send thee so I bespoke 3 doz
of what I think will look very well
and will wash very well I send the
paper for thee with my Aunt Lydia's
by George which thou wilt pay Betsy
for also 1s/3d pence on my account
which I had of hers having paid for
the paper I enclose the bill to thee
which I would thank thee to give to
Betsy I intend sending the brass
nobs by G if the Carpet was full
of moths or eggs it was well to sell
it I can get a good one for thee
for 3/6 per yd would not thou like
it to match the window curtains?
I suppose Edw will be at Moone to
I am to pas[unclear][/unclear] 1 doz for the
braid I [unclear]will send[/unclear]it tomorrow I
expect

morrow night it was provoking
enough to have such waste at Violet
Bunk when the money was wanted
that there was no one to mind it
I am very glad my aunt has got so
much I think she may wait for the
rest tile it is paid by those who owe
it to thee as Exetd
