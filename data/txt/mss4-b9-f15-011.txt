Sarah Leadbeater
11 Month 12 - 1818.
Dear Sarah
In considering the
present which I made to thee some
time ago of two volumes of Cowper's
Poems, it occurred to me lately that
it was imperfect without the remaining
volume, which I consequently
hereby send. [insertion]The liberty of presenting[/insertion] Such a gift appears
to me like a sort of compensation
for the privation of [deletion]corre[/deletion] not being
permitted to correspond with thee
as I have hereby an opportunty
of presenting thee with a work
containing (with a few exceptions)
my own sentiments, tho' with the
advantage of being expressed in a
much better form than I could have
done myself - I have now to be sure
taken the liberty of writing thee a [underline]note[/underline]

but I think, this does not lie
under so many [underline]seeming[/underline] objections
as a letter. I send thee also [deletion]I[/deletion]
a letter which I lately received from
Jacob Harvey [deletion]with some other interesting[/deletion]
[deletion]papers[/deletion] as also an American
paper containing some particulars relating
to the Connecticut Asylum for
the Deaf & Dumb, which, I am
sure will interest you in Ballitore.
Farewell
Thos Fisher
