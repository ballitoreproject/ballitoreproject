Richmond 25th of 9th month 1826
My dearest Deborah
I had a letter begun to thee
about a week since intending to send it by Wm
Harvey, but lo! he has not yet taken his departure,
but means to go tomorrow - the wind nor
the moon are not so variable as the Harveys
so much has this become a habit, that it is
even considered as a family trait & is consequently
tolerated & laughed at with a peculiar
chuckle allowing for the frailties of thick blood;
but yet not quarter as thick as the Clibberns
which is such [insertion]purple[/insertion] puddle that those of the name
are noted for not being able to pronounce the
liquid r. Now after all this preamble which
shows that I am [underline]as [/underline] proud with my thin pellucid
scarlet stream mixed with spiteful bile, I may
ask you how you are, & tell you that we
are as well as the bad times will allow
us to be - but what if we have "fallen on
gloomy days" we must only submit & look
forward, & forward still, till all ends in the
still place of rest. What ails me? What am I
writing? am I myself? yes & to prove that
I am - to identify myself I will mention the

two splices of my stock, Jose & Mary, sweet little
Mary, who is so sweet tempered that we never
hear her voice but when uttering lovely sounds
& squeels of merriment. She is blooming & harety
& very like James's old grandmother, that is
as like as an apple blossom is to an old wizened
apple which has been kept over for three
summers shrivelling in a hot closet. She is very
fond of walking, stands [underline]"loney[/underline] 'loney" & is missing
of a tooth & a half. Jese is becoming quite accomplished
& is ensconced in his trowsers, so
I am really growing an old woman. X has a
will of his own which I fear will become troublesome
some 18 1/2 years to come, for he is occasionally
rambunctius. Are they chips of the old
block? Deborah will thee come to the races
they are in full vigour "will thee come to the
top of the hill & take a peep?" as we did of
yore. - alas! if we do we must foot it - for
we sold our old black horse for - whisper
Â£7..10 - aloud - he was sadly Broken winded.
Eliza Harvey has not lain in yet - she
is to do it the 23rd of next month. Charlotte
Evans once an old maid Hill has performed the
above mentioned feat. Annt Jane has come
home, hush, hush, hush. - Hannah Harvey is

better - Sally is going to Dublin next week -
from thence to the North, then to nestle in
Ballitore for the winter - so saith the higher
powers. I wish I had thee nestling with me
like a magpie in [insertion]a[/insertion] fir chatter - chatter, chatter.
How are you? - gliding on still - over the calm
waters - well we are doing so too - only perhaps
not so calmly. how delightful it is to think
that we are all running the same course &
that we cannot long outlive those we mourn
for! I know of little so pleasant to dwell
except the idea of meeting again & never
being again parted;
but one is so certain -
the other is shrouded
in futurity.
Has Frederick returned to you? Why don't you
write to your poor Lyd. Have you lost me
in the ripple? Tell me about Willie Barrington
I wrote to his mother but have got no answer
& how is Betsy? also M Chambers? I want to
know every thing & I know nothing - poor I!
And above all how is dear father? Oh when I think
of his bereavement I feel an indescribable pinching of
grief & my tears flow reproaching me for being able
to trifle. - Yet so it is we weep bitterly one moment
& smile heartily the next. - Is it so with everyone?

I believe so - it is the rule of nature - & it is wisely ordered
so, or we would sink under the poignancy of our suffering
Have I told Ballitore that our Phoebe is going to leave
us - going to be married - but she says for not 6 month
to come but who minds [insertion]a [/insertion] maiden's vow[deletion]s[/deletion]? Scott says
"Tis lightly made & lightly broke" I believe we are to yet [unclear][/unclear]
sister - older than she is. No other news in the domes
machinery. Besure give my dear love to my father &
Elizth I am expecting a letter every night from the [unclear][/unclear]
To Mary Doyle & Abby Wright - to H White & beg of her to wri
to me - To Aunt Lydia Mary & Richard - And surely to
our Dick. Remember we do not give up seeing you in
October to spend a couple of months - Dear love to your
own two selves thin & fat. How are the "Great & Good"
& "the ould ancient Britain" not forgetting "Titherum ti"
Dearest Moonlanders ever ever afftely your
No Lander
