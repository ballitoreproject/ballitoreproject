Clonmel 19th of 1st month 1782

My Dear Father,

	We received thy last kind letter of 15th instant, I wrote a long letter to my Mother a few days ago, & since a few lines addressed to thee, in which I mentioned the doleful account we had received of the loss of ^our^ dear Jo Sparrow, & dear Edith Lovell, which letters I presume you have before now: our united hopes are not at an end, & the Parents & near connections of this beloved Youth are exceedingly to be pitied: his poor Mother seems a prey to grief & sorrow, Sam was telling me, she says she thinks of old Jacob who refused to be comforted for the loss of his son Joseph, & added, but I shall never have my Joseph again: & I am really afraid lest it bring down her grey hairs with sorrow to the Grave: his Father also seems quite dejected & his Brother & sister all in the deepest trouble: my poor Husband set off yesterday afternoon for Cork with Brother John, I am glad he is gone, hoping the meeting & company of his friends will be a strength to his dejected spirit, as he has grieved much since we heard of our loss, his sleep seemed to forsake him, & if he dozed his imagination was still filled with the gloomy subject, one night he thought Jo stood by him, & that he was but a shade: they seemed nearly united to each other in the bond of friendship, which has made the stroke a heavy one, time will heal the wound in others, but I am doubtful of its being too deep ever to be healed in our dear Aunts Breast. Providence is the great Physician of value, oh may he apply the Balm of his ^the^ consolation virtue of his holy spirit to her mind in this deep administration of the cup of affliction!
We are all of thy sentiments about procrastinating the accomplishment of marriage intended, I hope this will be a warning to other Young Women & their Parents.
Brother Roberts secrecy about his affair thou writes of much as we were talking about it, I believe he has not made a presentation yet, he writes he intends residging in house about 11 miles from York, & purposes setling [sic] in England, but his informations are so brief its [sic] hard sometimes to understand his meaning: 	We had the pleasure ^of^ my Brother Chandlees & Sam Haughtons company 5th day evening, but could not prevail on them to stay for company till the afternoon, so they set off early in the ^next^ morning (I believe) alone. There is an account in the News Paper, which lest thou hast not seen it I intend to transcribe (8.) Last Sunday senight, in the evening about 6 oclock, the Elizabeth Packet, Captain Summister, on her passage from Cork to Bristol, struck on the Culver sands, near the steep Holms, & bulged; the consternation of the affrighted passengers can only be conceived, expecting death every moment; they continued in this dreadful situation till ten oclock, when a Young Gentleman from Canada & some of the Crew being determined, got the Boat out, into which 13 Men & a Woman ventured themselves, intreating [sic] the Captain & the other passengers to come also, which they refused; seeing Death on all hands was certain, they chose rather to abide by the Wreck, than venture a more immediate dissolution in the Boat, about a quarter past 10 the Boat left the wreck, leaving behind them 24 souls, whose crys [sic] & lamentations at parting, can better be conceived than described. The Boat was left entirely to the mercy of the waves, no one on board knew where to go, Providence was their only Guide, when, after spending the night in the greatest distress they got on shore near Uphill about ? past six the next morning. It is supposed the poor Souls on board the wreck continued in that situation till the flood tide swallowed them up next morning. Amongst the above were the Wife of Mr. Robert Lovell, in Castle Green Bristol; a young Man of the people called Quakers, from Ireland, & a Gentleman & his wife, from Montreal, in Canada. On Wednesday the Body of the Captain was washed on shore.
	My Father received fresh accounts to day from Bristol by letters to Jo Garrant [sic] & J: Abell ^the friends there^ they have offered a reward of 5 Guineas apiece for the sending the Dead bodies Ediths trunk, Clothes & certificate are found, but not their bodys [sic] as we can hear of yet.
	Excuse my dear Father this scrawl, I have written with difficulty, having the noise of the children about me, being obliged to keep them in my room on account of colds, & having the young one to attend to besides
	My dear love attends you all, & am thy dutiful
		& affectionate daughter
