Richard Shackleton
Dear Cousin/
I received thy most acceptable Letter & sincerely congratulate thee on the pleasing prospect thou hast of Comfort & Satisfaction in thy Children -- My own are thus far, I think, pretty hopeful but the oldest is not yet thirteen, & mine poor things if they live, are likely to be exposed to many Dangers & Difficulties thine are happily strangers to -- I am greatly pleased with the account of thy son & that he likes his Fathers Business -- good & qualified schoolmasters are rare, & as laborious as the Task is to themselves, tis certainly one of the most useful important spheres a Person can well act in, as many young people are far more obliged to them than their Parents -- I was also favoured with a sight of thy worthy Fathers very kind Letter to my sister -- the enclosed from our valuable Friend I. Binns has laid several weeks in my hand waiting for one from my Sister to go along with it & this, but in a Letter I had from Sally last week she says wait no longer for my Letter to Cousin A. Shackleton. I shall not write yet till I have weighd the Contents of my Brothers Letter, tho I have not yet quite given up my Intention of paying a visit to my Friends in Ireland -- the Letter she refers to I received last first day from my Brother, to fix him in a school at German Town, a few miles from Philadelphia, consisting of 20 Boys at 20 a year each, & 60 a year salary for teaching em, John further adds that she is or will be shortly wrote to on that head -- I dare not nor shall I advise her either way, if she goes I shall not expect to see her again in this world, but shall have the comfort to think she is among the worthy & the good -- I always loved the American Friends Ive now more reason than ever ^for^ their tender regard & goodness to my poor brother they have noble Spirits -- A merchant from Philadelphia ^whose ship lay at Bristol^ gave us a call, Perhaps 2 months ago, he sent for my brothers little son, offered to take him over in his own ship provide stores for him give him his passage & keep him in his own family a year, the generous strangers name is Abel James -- his letter to Cousin Birkbeck by some accident came too late for the dear Boys going who now has no chance till next spring -- As to myself am better in Health than I have been (thro mercy) I believe Ive found more benefit from Air & Exercise than Medicine tho Ive tried both -- when I was reading thy Letter to my second daughter who is a fine girl but has weak eyes & backward at learning, tho a child of fine Capacity, my youngest girl not five years old seemed very attentive & when I came to the Account of thy Sally, she with much earnestness cried out be sure Mammy, dont forget my love to that little Sally however mine is a Sally too, a dear engaging little creature often out of order, is at present unwell, & I believe she thought by the Account thou gave me of thy Sally, that she was in more respects than one like herself which [4 words crossed out] made her desirous to have her Love sent to her & none of you besides
If my Sister goes to Ireland I believe thy wifes sister & her will be often together as the character thou gives of her is just what suits my Sister who is already an old maid but neither an affected nor peevish one, how pleased should I be to see you all I despair of ever having that pleasure for I am [7 words crossed out] so closely confined & constantly employed that excepting a walk ^for my health^ when the weather permit in the Fields Im few hours in a year out of my own house except when I go to Meetings ^of^ which I have not so frequent opportunities as I could wish -- my youngest a Child about 3 quarters old came home a month ago from Nursing -- where I had designed him to continue longer but feared he was not proper care taken of he now engages my attention so closely Im more hurryd than ever my poor girls are kept from school to assist me which is a loss to them too -- my oldest Boy about 11 years old goes to the grammar school the only school properly taught here as it is attended by two sober Masters but the under Master who has but 30 L. a year & almost all the boys to teach is too much oppressed with Numbers to bring em forward as he could wish he grows old & infirm he often has above 40 Boys the other Master teaches about 8 & has an income of near if not (by the advance of lands) above 300 a year so unequally is this world divided; we have not one good English School here which is a very great Loss to this Town when my Willy is a little older his Father promises me if all be well with us he will send him a year to a Friends School to write & Account either at Leeds or York to fit him for some Trade -- My Husband is abroad, Ive been so frequently interrupted, no time to transcribe scarcely to read over what Ive writ that Im afraid tis sad stuff -- I hope thourt kind enough to excuse all mistakes in the first place to please remember me most affectionately to thy worthy Father, the same affectionate remembrance thy self spouse & children also thy Sister in Law & my Cousin Bettys son, & when thou has a leisure Hour & canst find freedom I beg thoull not forget me but continue to favour me with a Letter now & then -- I think of you every Day & fancy myself now almost personally acquainted with you, & my young Cousins, so much am I obliged to thy condescension in giving me their Pictures which I often look at with pleasure & am Dear Cousin for thy many kind & welcome Letters thy ever obliged & affectionate
kinswoman

P.S. I hope Cousin Shackleton will excuse me keeping the Letter from Isabel Binns so long by me, it was entirely owing to my waiting of my Sisters to accompany it -- I have not yet told Isabel ^of my neglect^ but design to do it & hope she will excuse me too -- she is a worthy good Woman & deserved & beloved by those who see her exemplary & humble Conduct at Home [4 words crossed out] ^I mean^ in this Meeting, her own Family & Neighbourhood -- her Husband is a very plain blunt country Man, but is a weighty sound Minister his testimonies amongst are such as reach the Inward Witness & prove his Mission, for he is sometimes so wonderfully carried on that tis plain he is guided & assisted by a supernatural Power in an wonderful ^extraordinary^ manner
