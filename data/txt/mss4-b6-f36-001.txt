My dear E.
My Dear Molly
I recd. thy well wrote letter of
the 7th: 2 mo well pen'd very sensible but rather
stamping my friend ship at two high a Value
I believed the letters would be pleasing to thy
Beloved Parents and all their Branches to hear
how their brethren fared beyond the Western
Ocean: & I took the earliest opportunity to transmit
it to them as the were some of my Earliest
Acquaintances after I wittnessed in some
degree a change of Heart & sentiment and
tho' our lots are distant and our communion
only now & then renewed yet I find upon
the closest enquiry that the foundation on
which our friendship was built remains
unshaken & that the building tho' somtimes
tarnished by seperation & the Interpossition of
Worldly tolls, yet when it comes to be tryed
it retains [unclear]an[/unclear] Intrinsick Value & I trust will
never be adulterated by any mixture that
wont bear the stamp of Truth; fellowship
& Union: & it gives me pleasure when I reflect
that there is a prospect of an increase in the
Spiritual Kindred in the descendents of my
friends, their care has not been wanting Education
& example pointing to the good Old way
has a strong byass [unclear][/unclear] received with

Value. Education & Example is like the cutting and
forming of the Diamond and the Gift of Heaven is
the Polisher, & as all receives this Gift as its embraced
lived with, & obeyed, it beautifies & reflects
Light and beauty & wheresoever it turns it
prospers: My Dear Molly has all those favours
Confer'd on her, with all her Fathers house: prize

a Crown of Glory: I salute [insertion]thee[/insertion] in that love that
desires thy prosperity & growth in celestial
Knowledge & that as thou grows in years thou
may grow in that faith that overcomes &
gives dominion over every desire which prevents
thy being [insertion]a[/insertion] humble follower of the Lamb
that stands upon Mt. Sion; whose Votaries
Worships & sings the song of praise My Dr.
