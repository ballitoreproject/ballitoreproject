1st.. Tuesday - We were expecting Charlie out to
tea but he did not come - not being well which
was a great disappointment to me - Papa read
us some of "What will he do with it -".
2nd.. Wednesday - I rode over to see Charlie before
he went to town - and found him in bed and
not at all well - Doctor Darby was here - it is
an attack of dysentery which the Dr thinks will
last some days - poor Cha! a most inopportune
time to be laid up - Richard Shackleton
had driven out with him last night and
was here too - He went in by the 10-20
train - I rode down to tell Papa who was
going by that train too he and Mary -
[deletion]poo[/deletion] Towards evening Charlie suffered [underline]great[/underline]
pain - and we sent for the Doctor again.
Papa and Mary called on their way out
greatly to my relief - Cha got better
in about an hour and a half -
3 Thursday -[insertion]Ballyman[/insertion] Cha much the same - [underline]no[/underline] better
Doctor Darby came twice - Here I am now
regularly located - sleep in Phil's big bed -
He moved the small one into Charlie's room
and sleeps the night with him - Doctor Darby -
is not a bad medico I think -
We had to send for Doctor [unclear]Darbe[/unclear] in the night
March - 1859
