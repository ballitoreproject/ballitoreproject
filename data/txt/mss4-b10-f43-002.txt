Chicago, Ill. Aug 12/49
My dear & wellremembered,
Grandmamma
Though at such a
distance from your side & separated
for so long & it would now seem indefinite
a period, I assure you I
am neither wanting in affection, nor
solicitude for your good health. Never
can I forget to the last day of my life
the kind care you took of a certain
poor lame boy in the fall of 1839, nor
can he ever forget the many pleasant
days he passed in old Glendruid beneath
your hospitable roof. Amongst
the many delightful memories which
cluster around the associations of my
youthful days, few are more vivid
than those which picture again to my
mind the various charms of that dear

old place. Well do I remember the
delightful rambles I used to have in
the glen, the loves of my boyhood
whose initials are now I presume obscured
from sight by thick mantling
ivy! well do I recollect the old
library leading out of the drawing room
where I used to pass away many a
contemplative hour playing the old
organ, and the pleasant parties we
used to have with all my uncles and
aunts your children enjoying ourselves
to our hearts' content. aunt Martha
playing, aunt Eliza full of fun &
uncles Thomas [unclear][/unclear], Manliffe Arthur
& Fred[unclear][/unclear] & poor father all contributing
to the general enjoyment. When again
shall I hear father sing the shooting
Minister, uncle Arthur the Brave
old Oak, uncle Fred a Molly Baun or
uncle Thos[unclear][/unclear] the beautiful little song
of the 'Bonny Cuckoo'? All this is
so vividly brought up before me, with
your dear & well remembered presence
sanctifying the frolic! for was it
not on dear grandmammas birth day
night? Ah! well, Ah! well!
many bitter tears have fallen since
then, but not enough to efface such
sweet recollecting, but only to render
them [deletion]by[/deletion] brighter, as the summer
shower [deletion]bright[/deletion] brings out the lives of
nature's face into more brilliant & more
exact proportions.
I was truly glad to learn [deletion]find[/deletion] by
letters from home of your recovery from your
recent illness; may you [insertion]be[/insertion] preserved yet for
many years is my Earnest prayer!
As [unclear]Aed[/unclear] wrote to me you had expressed
to him a wish for my likeness, I enclose
one. I have yours & fathers photograph
in my little parlor, as my Household
Gods, my Lares & Penates to avert
all bad luck & ill fortune. My

prospects I trust will shortly brighten
& if I have good luck for a year or two
I shall certainly make a strong effort
to run over to see you all. My wife
& family are finely. Please give my
love to uncle Manliffe & Mary Gough
tell the former I have met an old
friend of his here a Mr Ducat, who
lives in this city, is married & getting
along very comfortably, but frets a
good deal after old times.
Dear Grandmamma, Goodbye
& Believe me Ever Yr very affte
Grandson William LB
