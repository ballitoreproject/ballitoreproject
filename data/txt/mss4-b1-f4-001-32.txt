my beloved child, the the God of thy ancestors has visited thee: be thou
therefore humbled in soul before him, and dedicated and devoted in all
thy faculties, to his service. Say not to the heavenly visitation, hitherto
"shalt thou come, and no further, and here shall thy waves be stayed"
But consign and resign thyself to the desposal of Him who knows best

us. Our great loss is, in that we are apt to be cutting and carving for
ourselves; and so, taking ourselves out of the Creator's hand, (who made
the world out of nothing,) we become as vessels marred upon the potter's wheel
The symmetry of the parts of the inward man, all its texture and fabrick,
and features would be right, and good, and proper, and the beauty of
holiness conspicuous, if we left ourselves to be fashioned entirely according
to the Divine Will.
I am called to supper. I leave thee with a degree of reluctance: that is

my heart **
I have always much pleasure in subscribing myself, my dear
Lydia's affectionate father
