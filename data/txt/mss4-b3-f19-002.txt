        My dear Uncles kind favour gave me a particular pleasure, as well on account of its being the first of the kind, as that it left you all in good health. P-T-Os cause of complaint is I hope ere now removed without forcing him to go to extremities as Polly Mellor has done; for one can not but regret the loss of a tooth, except it has been very frequently troublesome. Polly is determined if afflicted any more in that manner to get shut of the evil shortlyIn giving orders for the horses thou hast not mentioned thy own; a council was therefore called, which gave it as their opinion that if there should be ^was^ any errour [sic] it should be ^on the^ right side of the question, & as we had no authority for sending it, so we had none for detaining itto-morrow therefore they set off according to thy directionBetty Widdows was careful to send the old brass &c. by a carman, & to take a proper Memorandum of the sameThe man left this place yesterdayI told Owen what thou mentioned about his wife, which he bore with the utmost composure: I could not perceive whether he was affected with joy or sorrowWe continue the management of affairs much to our satisfaction: I hope every one else may be as well contented as we areI should be very happy if I was capable of being of more service than I feel myself to be. The boys have been finely preserved in health during your absense [sic]Ben White to-day began to complain of a sore throat; he kept his bed & says he is better this evening; I hope he will be very well in a day or two. Coote continues to mend, Requesting my love & duty to my Aunt & love to other relations & friendswishing you an agreeable tour & safe return, I conclude
        thy dutiful Nephew
                W. Rayner.
