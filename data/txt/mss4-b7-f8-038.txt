Athy Firstmonth 3rd 1791
My dear Molly
Lest [unclear]Frame[/unclear] according to her usual
Custom in conveying intelligence of disasters should
enlarge the account of that which has befallen
here it was thought proper that I being the
only idle person should write to inform you of
our being alarmed yester morning between five &
our being alarmed yester-morning between five &
six with the Cry of Fire in the street - The
Shop appeared from the outside to be entirely in
a blaze. Poor Debby all alive with the
exquisite feelings of a mother paid her whole
attention to the preservation of her Children who
along with her were conveyed half naked to
the house of a neighbour. Cousin Tommy got

got a very good assistance & the flames were
in a short time extinguished without suffering
a very material loss if we compare it with
what a few minutes more would in all probability
have accomplished but for the intervention of
Providence. The Fire was communicated from
the Kitchen of their lodges over the shop, &
destroyed a quantity of Goods immediately under
the hearth part of which were not near so
valuable as what was more remote - They
are trying to clear away the rubbish & separate
the goods which are damaged by Fire & Water
The Loss suppose they will be able to ascertain
in a day or two - Cousin Debby considering
the horrors of such a scene preserved her spirits
to

to admiration & still bustles about the house
She is apprehensive her little namesake is breeding
the measles or some disorder as she has been
dull for some days back - The confusion was
so great yesterday that Cousin Abrahams Mare
was not sent home & as he seemed rather
indifferent whether she was sent home or no - We
have concluded to keep her here while I stay
he need be under no apprehension of proper care
being taken of her. The Dearer takes two Hundred
Oisters for you & 1 Lb Mustard for Cousin Abm.
they have none in bottles I suppose it will
answer their purpose equally well -
Accept all our dear love here - Hope my
Aunt is quite re-established. - Thine affectionately
Wm Rayner
