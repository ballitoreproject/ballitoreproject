P
205
our souls will live, and we shall be acceptable in the sight of our great
Lord and Master; which is the perfection of our natures, & the end
of our being. So, my dear Margaret, be thou encouraged; let the
seal of the Lord's house more and more absorb thee, & be resigned
and devoted to serve the Lord in thy generation, with thy body, soul,
and spirit, which are all his, and over which he has a right to
an absolute control. I thank him reverently in spirit, that he has
allotted thee a husband who loves the truth in his heart, & whose
joy and delight it would be to see thee rightly and conspicuously
concerned in the promotion thereof. Thou hast also a sweet flock of
children, graciously preserved and continued to thee; thou hast
many dear, select, and choice friends whose spiritual fellowship
helps to nourish thy hidden life; thou hast the means of a
comfortable outward subsistence: all these great favours call
for a rendering something; and this something must be
nothing less than all.
R.S.
