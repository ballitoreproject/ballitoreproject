Dear Mary Leadbeater
I dont like writing to thee only
when I have something to ask and altho
the present enthusiastick application did
not wholly originate with me, yet I believe
thy warm & benevolent heart will
feel equally interested on the occasion
know then that some of the well disposed
inhabitants of this place have entered
pretty warmly into the circumstances
of the poor at this trying season
when provisions have got beyond
their means of purchasing them - we
have already subscribed abt 400 & much
more expected oatmeal & flax have
been purchased & the former distributing
twice a week - the plan is to give one
pint gratis [insertion]daily[/insertion] to every person over four
in family to such of the poor who appear
PS I regret having began on so small a sheet
Thou hast a large field for poetical fancy
a Lady possessed of so immense a fortune
married to [deletion][/deletion][insertion]an[/insertion] Irish [insertion]man our[/insertion] Secretaries son - a
country of poverty yet [insertion]of[/insertion] genuine nobility &
hospitality & whose sons have long groned
under accumulated wretchedness & want of
instruction - a part of her [underline]bounty[/underline] to be
applied to a neighboring Lancastrian
school or in any other more extensive
way she may direct - These
ideas may appear visionary - yet I
am not without hope - nothing ask
nothing have - Thomas has recd an
answer to his letter from the Bishop
of Leighlin & Ferns saying his Agent
woud call on him with his subscription

in want - widow & men past their labour
or in sickness in the same proportion, but
little if any to common beggars if known
we have near 1,300 on the list & at this
proportion abt £36 worth is weekly distributed
our Thomas is appointed secretary
& has been directed to send a number
of circular letters to persons here
& in England who have property or are
otherwise connected in this quarter - in
the good humour on the occasion one
of the company proposed sending a letter
to Miss Tenley Long & wch. I seconded &
proposed [insertion]to[/insertion] send her an Epithalamium
on her marriage the same person seconded
my motion & proposed thy name
as the most capable of the attempt - enclosed
is one of the circulars & if thou
shouldst find inclination & ability
to sing this overgrown Lady out of a few
hundred pounds (I reckon on one at least)
I propose that your School at Ballitore
shall have 1/4 part - thou canst introduce
that subject with our charity
this Lady is reported to be possessed of
£70,000 a year & £100,000 in money
& Abt to be married to the son of Wm.
Willesy Pole & so soon as we can be
ascertained of the marriage we wish to
have the epithalamium if thou
shoudst accomplish it send a copy
to me for the approbation of our
committee - Thy Sister Sally I expect
will be the bearer of this - we
feel for the situation of thy niece
Anne Fayle - our James has a very
hollow alarming cough - his rapid growth
has encreased our fears - affy farewell
Sam Haughton
