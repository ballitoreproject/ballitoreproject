Lisburn Aug. 16th. 1812
My dear Friend
Thy last letter has lain in my
writing desk six weeks unanswered. Shall
I at once confess that my reason for not writing [insertion]sooner[/insertion]
was because thou mentioned in thy letter that
thou intended putting my letters with those
of thy other correspondents into the form of a
book. I indeed felt vexed that my nonsensical
scrawls should be seen by any one except
thy self. When I sit down to write I do not
take time to consider about the style &c, I
merely think that my friend will be gratified
by hearing from me, & that she will
kindly overlook all defects in my letter. Indeed
it is not often that I can get time to write
a letter without many interruptions, unless
I write when all the family are in bed. Now
do, my dear Friend, let me entreat thee not
to shew my letters, throw them into the fire,
or into a lumber drawer, but do not, ah do not
let them be shewn with the letters of thy other
correspondents. I am conscious that I cannot
write well, & a kind of pride prompts me to
wish my letters not to be seen. But enough
displeasure to write immediately. Indeed it is often
cause of regret to her that we hear so seldom from
Ballitore but I would willingly hope that a diminution
of affection is not the cause. We are much as usual
here. Do write when thee has leisure & tell Deborah
that she ought to use her pen more frequently. I cannot
write more, I have been tormented with a severe head
ache for two weeks past, & with [insertion]stooping to[/insertion] write it is now so
violent that I can scarcely see. With dear love to Deborah,
Betsy Shackleton &c &c &c &c I am most sincerely
thy affectionate S Hancock.

of this subject, I need not tire thee with
egotism.
I hope you have received the last Magazine.
The account of T. Wilkinson's tour was very
interesting. I hope the tale, which thou mentioned
in one of thy letters has been found. I trust
thou will like the Magazine for August; we
have got as far as the Biography printed. The
Original poetry thou sent will be inserted
this month. Is the Ballitore Magazine
likely to be revived? I hope that Deborah
has not laid aside her pen. I suppose Elizabeth
has not returned home yet. I was very sorry
to hear that George Shackleton met with such
an accident. I hope he is now nearly well again.
I was a good deal astonished to hear that Betsy
Shackleton had gone to Cork.
I had a letter from my friend Houlbrooke
a few days ago. He says he [insertion]has[/insertion] a journey to Ireland
seriously in contemplation; but still I fear to
flatter myself with the hope of seeing him. He
says he will go to Scotland to pay a visit to his
friends at St. Mary's Isle & then he will come to
Lisburn. He has been employed forming a literary
& philosophical society, mostly composed of
young men; they have elected him president.
He has also been visiting the schools in Liverpool

in company with Dr. Bell. He says he found the
Dr. a plain, modest, unassuming man; rather
the tool of a party, than tenacious of his own
system.
As I have not been in Belfast lately, I cannot
give thee much information about the
sale of thy books, but Archer told me he would
write to Dublin for some of them. A gentleman
from Armagh lately called here to know which
of the Dublin printers was thy publisher. He said
[deletion]He[/deletion] he wished for some copies [insertion]of the Dialogues[/insertion] for distribution
as Maria Edgeworth had recommended [deletion]them[/deletion]
the [deletion]Dialogues[/unclear] to him - He made many [unclear][/unclear]
[unclear][/unclear] about thee, & I would not be[unclear]surprised[/unclear]
to hear that he paid thee a visit. I believe
his name is Macartney, but I am not certain.
I have been reading M Edgeworth's 4, 5, & 6th
volumes of Tales of Fashionable life, & I think
them fully equal to any of her other tales; the
Absentee is particularly excellent. Vivian
shews the necessity of an inflexible adherence
to principle Emilie de Coulanges, altho' it
points out the misery that a huffish dispositon
occasions to the possessor & to every
one around [deletion]them[/deletion] her, is not I think equal to
the other tales, the conclusion of the tale is
unnatural. In the tale of Vivian the character
of Lady Sarah Ledhurst is extremely unnatural,

yet the sentiments are so excellent, & the
moral so good that I admired it. The tale
of the Absentee is very national & of course
I like it. But if thou has read these tales
thou may think all I have said very uninteresting.
I have been highly pleased reading the life
of Ulrick Zwingle the Swiss reformer. I have
never met with a more interesting book. It was
written by Hess, & translated from the French
by Lucy Aikin. It gives a highly interesting
sketch of the reformation.
Betsy desires me to request thou would
tell Mary Shackleton that she cannot account
for her long silence; she desires her on pain of her
