Dublin - 7 July [insertion]17[/insertion]92.
My dear sister Margaret, should have had a [underline]particular[/underline] address
from me before now, - only I was, & have been, exceedingly hurried, since my return to town. But,
I was induced to defer writing, from another cause, - least my dear Mag, should be influenced by
any thing I might express, to do what would, perhaps, be much against her own happiness.
I dare say that thee has [underline]wished[/underline] to hear from me on the present [underline]weighty[/underline] subject: and
I should indeed, my dear Sister, hasten to gratify thee therein, if I knew what to advise, most conducive
to thy present, and thy everlasting happiness. I do think, from what I have already to
thee expressed, & from what I have before done on the part of our dear S, - that thee should know
every hope of my heart, on this serious affair. - which I now again say, is, that thee may my
dear sister, be [underline]only[/underline] happy, - and that thee may not, hereafter, have cause for sorrow in thy
determination, I beseech thee to address thyself with fervency, to the prime Author of
every good that flows thro life, - and next to [underline]Him[/underline], to thy dear earthly Parents Counsel,
& that of thy [underline]own[/underline] Heart. Do not Margaret, - ever make a connection, of so momentous
a nature, unless thy Heart be impeled to it, by affection, by Freindship, & by esteem,
for the object who solicits thy attention. Tho it is one of the greatest
wishes of my heart, and one of my best earthly hopes, to see my dear sisters, all and
each of them, well settled in a Matrimonial Life, - yet I should [underline]never indeed[/underline],
cease to regret it, if I had the smallest conviction that they were unhappy, and
their hearts & affections not united by every tender tie which can render life
happy. - Consider every point, every circumstance, of a matter, which may
be hereafter, for thy future peace & Joy, or for thy unceasing sorrow thro life. I look
upon the Matrimonial state, to be that, of the greatest earthly bliss, if rightly formed, if
the affections & the Hearts unite in Virtue. - But on the contrary, it is, & must be, that
of the greatest misery this world can afford. - In the solitude where thee

thee resides, there is little of the world to dazzle thy attentions, - therefore thee can, my
dear Sister, with greater care, reflect on these matters, now of so much apparent consequence
to thy happiness. Thy Counsellors, there, will be sincere & unbiased by the
glitter of this Life, - and I hope thee will [insertion]be[/insertion] enabled to fix on that opinion which will
render thee the most permanent & lasting joys -
If by writing, ought should avail to thy establishment in
every bliss - I should not fail to do so, with ardor, & every affection which a Brother
can feel. But that Heaven may be thy Guide, is the sincere hope of my dear Sister
very affectionate Brother RM -
My love & Duty to my dear dear Parents, & sisters -
Tell my Father that I have not had time to go to the boat, with the Pumpstick, since
I came to town - but that I will send it to Rathangan by the first boat next w[unclear][/unclear]
Dixon says that John had a great deal of impudence to ask for
such a girl as Margaret. -
