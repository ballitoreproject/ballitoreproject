My dear Sister
As this is the first
letter I ever wrote to thee
I hope thou will answer
me with a long letter I have
been at Fanny Bewly's
since thou went home Lucy
Bewly sent in the
girl with her love to me
and said she would be
glad of my company.

[deletion]I Glasbrook[/deletion] I went to Thomas
Glasbrook's the other day,
they were balloting
for the Militia. Nancy
Lawler has left us, and
we have got another
Girl, her name is
Rose Dunahu, I like
her very well. I cant
say more for I have not
time. I am thy affectionate

Sister S. Leadbeater
