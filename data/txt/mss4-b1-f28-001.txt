A Dream dreamed by Micah Weer Junr.. in the North of Ireland,
aged about 13 or 14 years.
I beheld the Sun was arisen & was exceeding broad & clear,
& I saw several antient [underline]Friends[/underline] of whom I had read particularly
George Fox, in the Sun, all of them were of like Colour
with the Sun, only they were discernible like Shapes of men in
it; & I thought as soon as I beheld George Fox, & had seen him
walk up & down a considerable time, lo! I beheld many more of
like Apparel with him, who were walking up & down in the
Sun: Also again I beheld the Sun as thick with men as possible
[deletion][/deletion] all of one Apparel & Colour with the Sun, but
I had not long beheld, considering so wonderful a Sight,
until the Sun was covered over with little Motes, & hillocks of
Earth, and spots of mixt Colours working thro', here & there
in the body of the Sun, & Dust flying up & down in a wonderful
manner; & considering what it cou'd mean, I beheld
all the places, where the Motes & Earth had been, were quickly
covered over with blood; then I saw a man come up & sprinkle
it over with clear water, until it was purifyed as before, & then
I was in it, & never more decreased; for while the spots were in it,
it decreased to the bigness of a Full-Moon; also the light thereof,
was like the light of a dull Full-Moon, but when it arose, it
had the light of many Suns, & was as broad as many Suns, &
now it waxed great, as in the beginning, & never set nor decreas'd
at all. And thus I awoke, and falling asleep in the same night,
I dreamed I saw George Fox, & told him what I had seen concerning
him

him, He after a little Pause told me the Interpretation
was as followeth, Viz.
The Sun that arose so bright was the Gospel;
they who were in it, were the Church of Christ, that was redeemed
from the Earthly corruptions, & had their Garments made
clean in the blood of Jesus; & whereas the Sun was very
spotty with Clods of Earth, so shou'd Riches bear sway in
the Hearts of some, & by that, Truth shou'd be much lost,
and the upper side of the Sun, where the spots were most,
was London: & whereas the spots were turned into blood,
so the Lord would Scourge the Professors of Truth, who
were drawn off from the Poss[insertion]ess[/insertion]ion into Earthly-mindedness
& as the Sun was purified by Christâ€™s washing it
with water, so shou'd the Gospel also, and never set, nor
decrease.

Micah Weer's Dream.
