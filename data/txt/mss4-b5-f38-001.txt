For M Shackelton
My Dear Friends kind letter, was a very
welcome proofe of her remembrance, and
affectionate notice, for which I am much
obliged- and trust the same good Hand- that
raised tender desires in thy mind, will be
more, and more stretched forth, for thy gathering
within the divine inclosure, where there is
safety and peace- when I see many of my
Beloved Friends, entrusted with the five talents,
how I long- that they be seanctified. and
witness an holy dedication to [underline]his[/underline] service whose
Gifts they are- that when the solemn account
comes to be closed- there may be this joyful
language, thy five talents has gained other
five- the Day calls for it my Beloved Friend,
the Harvest truely being great. and the
faithful labourers are few- the command
therefore still is "pray ye the Lord of the
"Harvest, that he would send forth labour
into his Harvest."
My heart has been many
as at this season, enlarg'd in the Love of
our Heavenly Father towards thee- with ardent
breathings- that none of those talents whereof
thou art only a steward. and for which thou
must be accountable- might retard thy progress
in that high and holy way, which the
"[unclear]?ulterous[/unclear] eye hath not seen. neither hath the
"Lyon troden it. or the [unclear]feirce[/unclear] Lyon passed by
"it- yet the way faring Men. tho' fools. ( as to
"the wisdom of this world) shall not err therein"-
for we must become fools ere we can be wise
unto Salvation, should we ever meet again in
mutability- it would be joy. to see thee bow'd to
to the pure [underline]seed[/underline] in thine own heart, and dead
to every thing, but that life which is hid with
Christ in God- and I am glad to believe from
my feelings- there is an encreasing desire
in thee to grow this way- and there is no doubt
but as thy obedience [unclear]meets[/unclear] pace with knowledge
[unclear]R [/unclear]Wright M [unclear]Shouth[/unclear]- are about Bristol, on [unclear]their[/unclear] way from Cornwall to London
Wm Mathews- & Ann [unclear]Jessop[/unclear]- was lately in [unclear]?don[/unclear]

strength will be proportion'd to the trials of
the day- Thy Sister Sally is afresh before
me, with much sweetness- and to her I say-
go on from strength, to strength- not fearing
what man may say of thee- "fear not him
that can kill the Body only- but fear [underline]Him[/underline]. that
hath power over both Soul and Body-
I think I may say that best Love flows
towards my Dear Friends at Ballitore in the
fresh feeling of which I remain thy sincere Friend
Love to A. Spartnes & J. Able
