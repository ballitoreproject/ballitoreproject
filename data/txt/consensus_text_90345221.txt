with Papa - Mr Leymour the coal
merchant was our travelling companion
and seemed to be a very chatty man.
The covered car met us, and
we came out almost as snugly
as if we had been in the carriage.
21st: Shortest day I suppose -
a gloomy one too - Lilly and
I took a race down to Betty
Byrne's - Polly took a ride after
dinner and paid a farewell
visit to Ballyman -
22nd. We had a long conversation
last night with Papa before
going to bed, all about settlements
&c &c and did not go to bed
till nearly 12 1/2. - Papa went
to town this day - by the 2 1/4
omnibus - Had a letter from
Margt - Poor little Joseph Leadbeater
has either the measles or scarletina
and is at Stradbally now.
