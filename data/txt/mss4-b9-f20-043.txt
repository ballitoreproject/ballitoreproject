My dear E - I am teasing thee I'm afraid about
servants etc Cath: Duffy call'd again to know if I
had heard of any place for her which I had not I told
her that I wd write to thee that thou might be
on the look out if she would not suit thyself,
thou might ask her aunt about her, she is
much to be pitied as far as I know, did thou
get my hurried scrap by the cochman, Ally Smith
is not able to take one of [unclear]Hese[/unclear] she has not got the
right use of her limbs yet so that I must get
some one else very soon I that the housemaid
I have and do for the children as I think it is
easier to get a housemaid than one to mind children
thou can turn the whole affair in thy mind & let me
know as soon as thou can the result of [unclear]thy[/unclear]
[underline]cogitations[/underline] thou might ask M Davis if [unclear][/unclear]
Neville was easily target whether she was good
taking up a thing she knew, Anne Toole who was
a good girl but very stupid now I wd not like
to get a stupid girl, I think I have now said
enough about servants at least for the
present, How is Fanny I gave a little parcel in
charge to Richd Webb to send by P Watson Harriet
left it with me to be sent by a safe hand
Say when thou writes something of Marg
Doyle I seldom hear any thing about her
give my dear love to her, as for Abby I'm
out of her books or she'd say a word now
& then, how is Dick? give my dear
love to him When he comes next -
I can read letters to Lydia once a week or
fortnight so you might send them to me
thy might be old [unclear]Lafna[/unclear] she'd get there but she wd
be glad to get old or [unclear]not at all[/unclear]
