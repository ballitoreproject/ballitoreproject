Augst 5th Inverary
On board Norma
[1855]
My dear Mamma
Here we are on
board the yacht in this
lovely place, it seems to
me very odd how we ever
sailed up here, it is not
quite so lazy as if we
had more sea room
but it is well North
a little bother, it is

all the way up so beautiful
I am thinking very much
of [underline]you[/underline] here and of the
time we were here together
you can fancy to yourself
Manliffs yacht lying just
nearly opposite the Hotel
we were in, & the fine
view of the Castle & mountains
I am in a great
hurry with this note as
there is but [underline]one[/underline] hour
today that the Post Office
will be open, & we are
intending to go to the
Scotch Church, there is
no English one here -
We are all finely, & intend
starting very early
in the morning if the
Wind & Weather will permit
us - I know of no
place for you to write
except Gourock or Largs
love to all, your much attachd
MJB
I have not got a letter here, but
hope I may to day -
