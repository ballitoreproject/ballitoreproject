Commercial Hotel Amsterdam
July 5th 30
My dearest Mamma
This is a small
bit of paper - but it is better than
none as the letter wont hold any
more & I just want to let you know
that we are safe and here I received
your letter on Monday & was glad to
get it, the same day I wrote one home
saying how we got to Cologne after
we posted it. We went to the top of
the Cathedral with two Americans, a
man & his wife. I dont know their names
We went back to the Hotel at 5 oC and
found that Dr H & C had only just
arrived [insertion]we[/insertion] staid in Cologne till wednesday
3rd & saw a good deal of the town
and were in several churches
we left it at 5 oC in the morning &
arrived in Arnham in time for the
5 oC train for this. I mean in the
packet and sailed down the
Rhine it was very pleasant the whole
time and I like the Rhine very much

Dr Henry brought me on land
at Dusseldorf that I might have it
to say that I was there - we arrived
here at [unclear]6[/unclear] oC - that day was so long
it was very like two, Yesterday
was a wet day it was the wettest
we had since we left Ireland
but for all that we went to the
Gallery of Pictures I liked [underline]them[/underline]
far better than any I saw at the
Louvre in Paris, it cleared up
in the evening and we went out
again along the sea side, this town
is very curious, it is so odd to see
the canals running through the streets
The people here are more like the
English than any we have seen,
their caps are not like those of the
French, immense borders down
their back and over their face
they also have a broad band either
across their forehead or the back
of their heads this band I think is
made of brass at least it has that colour
at the edge it has some ornament

like my band for [unclear][/unclear] which shows
out at the side of their face they are
cleaner than those I saw either at
Brussels or Cologne but not [underline]as[/underline] clean
as those in Paris -
It is not settled yet where we will go
next - so I cannot tell you, but I will
write when I can give my love to all
Tell Miss Browne I was glad to get her
letter and we did all we could to
get what she wanted there was no
such thing in all Cologne except a medal
wh Aunt Eliza bought for her as she thought
it was better than none it has two views

of [deletion]it[/deletion] [insertion]the cathedral[/insertion] one on each side, both different
Aunt Eliza told me to tell you to direct
to

you receive[deletion]d[/deletion] this -
ever thy affectionate
Daughter
