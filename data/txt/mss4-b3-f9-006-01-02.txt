From the same to the same

Ballitore: 22/10 month 1773

Dear Cousin,
	I am favoured with thine of 3rd instant  To manifest my good inclination to keep up so agreeable a correspondence I put pen to paper, but as to conversing on the most interesting subject, do not expect to be favoured with ability to say much thereon. Happily we know that the inward man is nourished & strengthened by food which the Father of mercies thinks convenient for us, & that speaking or writing about religious matter, when not under some degree of a living sense, genders [?] to impoverishment rather than enriching. Yet does the Author of our being & well-being see our wants & our sense of our wants, & even though we are not able to form the secret petition, he accepts of the disposition of the heart, when right before him, as fervent, effectual prayer. It is good to be faithful to death, not to be restless or impatient, as it were not to stir up or awake the Beloved of Souls till it pleases himself to come. To be quite quiet, patient & will-less in this state, as in a state of spiritual inaction & incapacity is (in my apprehension) to be faithful to death: & this seems to me the readiest & surest way to obtain (in the Lords good time) the crown of life, for it is life which is the crown both of our own feelings & any little services which we may be made capable of in society. I note, & I think I have some sense of the state of the youth in your meeting. A spirit has lifted up its head, & gathered strength amongst them, which I fear is of the world, & not of the Truth: it is a plant of [page number] speedy & tall growth, but it lives only in the summer & sunshine of ease & affluence, when storms & trials come, it will droop its high head, & appear but insignificant & contemptible. A few solid Elders & wise-hearted youth diligently keeping alive in their meetings the sacred genuine fire of heavenly origin would tend much to burn up & consumer this evil plant, & to meliorate the ground & prepare it for better, nobler seed.
	I observe what thou mentions [sic] about the new appearance in your meeting. I know the man a little. When a person is of blameless life & conversation, & what is said as to matter & manner does not seem liable to exception, it is safest I think to allow time for probation & to follow the apostolick advice of Lay hands suddenly upon no man. Indeed in our poor land, so little fruit of this nature comes to perfection that experience has taught us it is not best to be too sanguine in expectations. It would be very wrong indeed to hurt any thing that is right.

	I am, dear Joseph,
		affectionately thine
			Richard Shackleton
