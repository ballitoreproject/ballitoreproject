8th.. month.
having debated a good deal
about the matter we settled
to postpone our intended visit
to the Thifts till to-morrow - and
instead after a great deal to
do we got Mat Sutton to
[extra line]
put the [unclear][underline]Lyzzie[/underline][/unclear] mare [unclear]in[/unclear] the car
and saddle Charlie's filly
which he left out here -
We brought the nurses &
children Polly drove & [unclear]I[/unclear]
rode, at first I was rather
afraid, as the filly had
just galloped away with
Mr Sutton and has a
very hard mouth - however
after the car she went
very well and I quite
enjoyed the ride, we went
round by [unclear][/unclear]Tirne[unclear][/unclear]
house by the Dargh road.
The day was rather showery
Mama had a pleasant letter
from Lilly this morning.
