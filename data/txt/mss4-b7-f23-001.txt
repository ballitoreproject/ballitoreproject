Continuance of your Correspondence, you made Me
very happy by the pleasing Account you gave Me
of My Dear Edward, I intend to Leave Him at
School with your Brother till I can hear of A
Proper Master to bind Him out to Business, but
think it necessary to give Him no hope of Staying
Long there, that He may[insertion]be[/insertion] doubly diligent while He
is there, of hope He had no return of the Cold,
you mentioned His being getting the better of, I
know Mary you will be kind enough to Let Me
hear particularly from you when any thing is
the matter with Him, — I wont' be uneasy at
having Him So far from Me only I am well
Convinced of the Friends He is with & the great
attention of His Misstress to Him when any thing
ails Him to whom I beg you will give my
Affectionate Regards & to your Brother Likewise
