My dear Elizth
We left the parcel at J Cumming's - Willie
is much better & kicks & laughs again but has not
got up his flesh, yet, the journals afford me
great pleasure & I am greatly obliged to thee for
thinking of sending them with me - I keep
them lock'd up except while I read so that I hope
to return them safe - I long for sweet Hannah
altho' I know I cannot have her long - we
found Johnny very well his hair cut short,
H Bandman is in town still, there is
a rumor of Sally's going to be married to
a Waterford gentleman of the name of [unclear]Sprig[/unclear]
brother to an atorney there, who had been
very intimate with her father, perhaps
she may be just off this match as she was
the other some time ago.

advertises to take Deck passengers there & back
again for Â£1 - give my dear love to my father
& tell him I send him the worsted I spoke
of - ever thy SB
Elizth Leadbeater
