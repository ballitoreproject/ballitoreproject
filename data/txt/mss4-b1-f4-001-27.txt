frequent employment to wait for the renewing of that power to your
spirits. Divine love is the great bond of our religious Society
which pervades every living member of the body and joins all
together in a holy union. I doubt not but you experience this at
times, to cement you to one another, and to all the living.
I wish you health and prosperity, and every blessing; but
if He who has you, I trust, under his care and keeping, sees meet
to chasten with the stripes of affliction, may you be so instructed
by the dispensations allotted, that you may be enabled each to say
"Not my will, but thine be done!" My heart is often engaged
for you, with tender solicitude. Your track of life is an arduous
path, thick sown with a variety of trials, probations, perplexities,
and difficulties: may Solomon's wise choice be yours, and may you
happily obtain substantial wisdom to direct, and substantial help
and comfort to confirm your steps and strengthen you in your way.
R. S.
