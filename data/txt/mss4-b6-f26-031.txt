Alas, my friend! Thou art tossed, & tried, & stripped & apparently
almost forsaken - so it seems by thy letter, the
reading of which has I hope done me good - a little good
for much I am not capable of receiving. But if it be so
with those who are the objects of divine regard I who deserve
all & much more than I feel - should bear patiently,
& bow beneath a rod wch I merit, tho' it may scourge me to
death. This was a memorable evening, I am sure it must be so, because
even [underline]I[/underline] felt it & Mary Ridgway was powerful & comfortable
indeed - How did I beg some of the crumbs wch fell from the
childrens table, but she had nothing for me. Well I had no
intention to write this if at all - I just meant to say send thy
letter by all means - but being left alone in the parlour at
the School, see what I have done!
