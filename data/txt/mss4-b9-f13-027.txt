Richmond 20th of 4th month 1828.
My dearest Sarah
All I could wish when I arrived
at home safe & well & happy was that thou knew
it as well as myself - or that I had thee a witness
to my happiness & thankfulness. We had a most
comfortable journey, agreeable companions, & every
chance so fortunate that I am sure I chose the
luckiest night in the year for my adventure.
The very first breath of Jose's native breezes
seemed to have the power of bestowing bloom
& good humour upon him, he looks quite
radiant today. They seemed to have a presentiment
of our arrival, for James was waiting
for me & I was hardly landed when my lovely
Sally & Mary drove up in the car for me. The
moment Mary saw me she screamed out "Oh
there's Mama & there's Dady" She was in the
wildest delight. Father is quite relieved, for he
was nervous about our return, & by not waiting
to write by post they were saved considerable anxiety.
Even the Summervilles were in great joy, so that
my father says it was well I went away to prove
my value. Poor James had to go to the Bank

today - even today. The children look gloriously
Hannah Jane toddling with the hold of one hand
& a fair Jam role - She is the roundest fattest
brownest lump extant. She has grown quite
fond of me & leaves her papa for me - the
only one she would leave him for. - I am afraid
the attraction of my yellow wrapper is the
powerful magnet. I have nothing to tell thee
yet about our sweet home, as the man has
not returned an answer to my father's proposal -
as soon as I know something for certain
I will write to thee. Father is now sorry &
anxious that the answer may be against
him - need I say how much I am. James &
Sally & Hannah Harvey (our oracle of taste)
admire the brown ware prodigiously. - & are
afraid that I will lose it by not taking it
when there. but I do not wish to commission
thee until I can send word how it is to
be sent &c &c - Did Eben see it & does he
like it? - I find that I was wanting at home
on many accounts - though, thank goodness
health was not one. I do not even feel fatigued

& after washing & dressing yesterday, visited
Summerville & did not require my bed
until past eight o'clock in the eve. Jose
slept all the way here & did not go to bed
until the other children. - he is fresh - as a rose
this morning. I put thy bottle twice to my mouth
on the way. It did me good. Success to the bottle.
darling sister. I believe I don't love you enough
when among you I feel such a gush when I leave
you. Tell Edwd. I delivered his message to
affection to me a "[underline]Johf"[/underline]. I mean to write
to Debh this eve & to send a message to poor
Dick whom I so cruelly disappointed for the sake
of my own ease. If thou sees [insertion]him[/insertion] my dear Sarah
tell him the state of the case & how I had
resolved on the plan late on the evening
after post hour. & then was too much hurried
the day I came to write to him. I am sure
I would not wish to wound or slight him.
Ah! when shall I see thee again my
my father & give him my
dear love. I feel grateful to
him for his kindness &
Lovingly thine L J Fisher.

For
Sarah.
