My dear E -
I bought the paper for thee
but am afraid Hannah can't
take it as Butterford has not
sent it home yet according to
promise it cost 5/- [unclear][/unclear] it is
not quite perfect if thou should
not like this kind I need not
get it again - the starch
& blue are for Deborah
I shall miss sweet Hannah
greatly, I have had an anxious
time about Willie but hope
he is better
Thy SB
