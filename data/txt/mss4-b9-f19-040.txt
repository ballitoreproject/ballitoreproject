My dear Elizabeth
It is time for me to acknowledge
my thanks to Mary R for her nice muslin of which
I made two gowns & got from J Williams what made
spencers to wear over them as they have short
sleeves it is very neat muslin, what luck I was in
but thou wilt think I neglected thy commission
about thy napkins which I did not & am sorry
that I succeeded only in finding two of these
which I lock'd up till thy return, & art thou
longing for that time, thou must be sadly
puzzled between leaving M R which seems
almost impossible & the desire of seeing us
all at home EB is with us nite we go on as
[unclear]srele [/unclear] as me can [unclear]snatching [/unclear] a ride now &then
well as we can snatching a ride now & then
when we can get any one to come along with
Ms BL & BM accompan[deletion]y[/deletion]ied Elisa & me a few days
ago to David's town & Balline curiyg ML amused
us with stories from Boccacio not indeed
of the most delicate, but how could we help that

S Haughton has had lovely Sarah Jane here
with her & took away Betsy poor Mary is
very lonely as may suffred but frequent trips
to town familes the love we are almost
continually visiting in the evenings, we are
now on our second round
Ballitore 24th memorable day for thy SL

[deletion]I may take[/deletion]This is our wash week what wilt thou say
when thou sees the towsds [unclear] L2[/unclear] thru arts badly
when thou sees the towels & &c thou art badly
wanting to regulate us a little in this way
Biddy says if Miss Eleesabeth was at home
the towels wouldnt be so dirty -
