Belfast 5 mo 24. 1870
Dear Friend
M Barrington
In reply to thine [unclear][/unclear] hand
this morning, Rebeccca left
for London yesterday week
and I have since had several
letters from her and though
she has not had time to write
much about the meeting
she seems to be taking all the
advantage she can of it - If
thou art going she will no doubt
be very glad to see thee. Her
address is as before Mrs Ashburner
37 Jewin Street -
With reference to the oil I fear
thou wouldst not be able
to procure it in Dublin, it
is quite suitable for oiling
any kind of machinery or
locks, we are out of it at
present, but hope to have some
in a few days and if thou
canst inform me of any
opportunity, I shall be glad
to send thee some -
We are all pretty much
in our best fashion; - we
are greatly interested in a
workmans Exhibition which
has been open here for the
last few days which has
proved a complete success.
Thy friend Sincerely
Geo O'Brien
