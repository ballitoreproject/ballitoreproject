Glendruid 25th of 9th mo
1826
I cannot say how much I was disappointed
my dear father at not seeing thee at this time
I look'd forward with pleasure to the meeting
thinking it would bring thee to us & I
fill'd myself with hopes that I could have
coax'd thee out here for at least one day
where we might enjoy thy company without
making thee suffer with the thick air
of Dublin, I have settled my self here with
Rose & the three children intending to stay
while the fine weather lasts on Willy's
account, who has improved since he breath'd
the country air, his second tooth has not
appear'd yet tho I thought I felt it a
week ago, I had a most agreeable
letter from Lydia, telling how well she
found all at home, Mary Doyle came
to see us, if it were possible I would

I would say that Willy remember'd her he
went to her so quietly & seem'd so pleased
with her, Margt. & Johnny are very well
Johnny almost too fat, he got his eye teeth
lately & is getting the under ones opposite to
them - Betsy Barrington open'd the
meeting in a modest diffident manner
as usual, Sarah Knott follow'd in fervent
prayer, then Cath: Tue then Jacob
Green Rachel Maria Kit Bentham
& Jacob again, William Allen did
not come as was expected
Jas Graydon call'd on Edw a few days
ago to leave a message for Elizth a request
that he would send "Erskine on the Christian
Faith" to us that we may send it to its
owner a Lady from whom Jas borrow'd it
& who is anxious to have it at home
I hear that both Martha & Margt Wright

are better, I have not seen Abby yet
thy very affect daughter S. Barrington
