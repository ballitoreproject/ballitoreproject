down by herself. Soon after I
came up Papa & Mama went
out to walk, and I was left solus;

4th. A pouring wet morning
so much so that Charlie could

out here and went with
Papa & Joe - It cleared up
a little in the evening & I
took a walk, but rather a lonely
one - - It is now raining
again - I wrote a letter to Charlotte
Pim to day answering one from her
The poor cows are all
