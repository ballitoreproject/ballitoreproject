My dear friend
The purpose of my desiring a little private conversation
with thee, was to confirm the truth of a Report
which (if it has not already) will soon reach thy Ears -
I have made a proposal lately for a beloved friend of thine
of whom we were talking this evening, & the matter being quite
agreeable to all her Relations &c, is now under her serious &
deliberate consideration - Anna Taverner was acquainted with
it when we went to visit her, & expressed much joy & satisfaction
at the prospect - Now I was thinking that if thou, being
so intimate with both, was at a suitable [deletion]situation[/deletion]season to
have a little [deletion]conversation[/deletion][insertion] Discourse[/insertion] with Anna , she might be free to
express her feelings on the Subject, which thou couldst communicate
by letter to R M - Perhaps this would be some inducement
to a determination in my favour; (for which 'tis
needless to say how anxious I am, though not otherwise than
with divine approbation) & at all events it would be gratefully
acknowledged as an eminent favour conferred on
Thy sincerely affte. friend
