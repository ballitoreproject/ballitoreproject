Dublin 17th July 1828
My dear Elizabeth
I wish to know what I am
to do with your unsigned leases. I rent James
Fisher his and have not heard a word from
him since. Your note was left at Ardills,
I hope they have agreed to take 10s in the
pound or at least ^15%. Will you be kind
enough to let me know by first oppy whether
The plaisterer and thatcher have completed their
jobs on the Hill, I hope Eben will not pay
them untill we see that they fulfilled their
Contracts. Unless you desire me not to do [insertion]it[/insertion] I intend
paying Jo White his demand. [deletion]not of[/deletion] The balance
which I have in my hands of your amts to
near 10 pound since I got out of G S receipt from [unclear]her[/unclear]
and I believe the rent due is 12/10/0- for 3
half years. Have you applied to Thos Glayebrook
to know how much he intends to lessen the
Amt of his [unclear]bad[/unclear] debt this year? When I
was in Ballitore last I gave you of J's mistake
not, a statement of the Title of the Early[insertion][unclear]st Cousins[/unclear][/insertion]
will you send it to me as soon as you can
We hope to see Eben. & Deb soon. Tell them to come
in time to behold the great doings at Kingstown next
Monday and other days of the week Yours affectionately
turn over GB

My dear E - I intended to have written by M Doyle but I am
glad thou art relieved about the fate of thy [deletion]note[/deletion] [insertion]letter[/insertion] [deletion]tak[/deletion]e to [unclear]Arbill[/unclear]
which Edw very much approved of I hope it will have a
good effect, thy Parasol is here it cost only 2/4
& looks tolerably well, they would charge 7 or 8 shillings
for silk & it would not look nice after all thou
could buy a new one as large for 7/6 I believe
I hope thou wilt soon come to sign thy leases
so whatever it is that is to bring thee to
Dublin give my love to thy great
ever thy SB
By Wence send the other side to Deb I have 
taken the lodgings in Bray for a month
for her & me
