My dear Elizabeth
Untill this day, we
could not return what you are pleased
to denominate a favorable answer, to your
very kind letter inviting us to spend more
than a day with you. This day at
which you seem so surprised was I
believe in a great measure the
creation of dear Deb. Who could think
of going to Ballitore and remaining
[underline]there[/underline] but a day except your humble
servant before he was married. I assure
you that is not our present intention
and if we hear not from you to the
contrary, we hope to have the pleasure
of seeing you all on Wednesday or Thursday
next, and once more meandering

through the pathways of your sweet
valley. I had some hopes of being
able to please myself in a house
this week just past but have not
yet succeeded. So that it is likely
on hiding double is out of fashion, we
shall be obliged to have recourse
to that vulgar mode of conveyance
the Conlan coach. Should the Eternal
[unclear]Hercules[/unclear], (excuse my taking your [unclear]card[/unclear])
and any thing else interfere
you will oblige us my dear sister
by stating on what other day we
should set out I am with love to all
your affectionate
Edward Barrington
for Sarah and
himself
