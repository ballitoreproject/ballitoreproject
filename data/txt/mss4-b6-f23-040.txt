Alas she saw her future hope
Droop, languish, & decay,
And in the grave beside her Sire
Her little Mary lay
Still one dear life remain'd - & oe'r
Her mother's bed she hung
Yet then, with many an anxious fear,
Her boding heart was wrung.
[deletion]Alas[/deletion] In vain are her unwearied cares
That valued life to save
And soon poor Judith hopeless wept
Beside her mother's grave
Ah lonely is her Cottage now.
None there her entrance hail,
And gone are those loved ones with whom
She shared her frugal meal
Yet while she cherish'd silent grief
To one her worth was known
Who saw reflected in her mind
The feelings of his own -
He [deletion]sought that[/deletion] [insertion]seeks her[/insertion] hand, [deletion]that[/deletion] [insertion]and[/insertion] faithful heart
Nor [deletion]was[/deletion] [insertion]is[/insertion] his suit denied
And duteous Judith [deletion]has[/deletion] [insertion]is[/insertion] become
The duteous Owen's bride -

A Wife for Owen
By Griese's silver stream there bloomd
A simple modest flower
Yet one so beauteous & so sweet
Might grace a courtly bower
'Twas Judith - from her early day
A life of toil she led,
Yet gladsome health & gay content
On her their blessings shed.
By many a swain her hand was sought
They breath'd their tender sighs.
And happy was the lover deem'd
Who won the precious prize
Ah soon the dawn of wedded love
With clouds was overspread,
Pale sickness on the husband seiz'd
And hope's gay visions fled.
Could all that fond affection tried
Avert the fatal blow
Then youthful Judith had not felt
A hapless widow's wo.
Her husband dead - her new born babe
With tender [deletion]boding[/deletion] tears she eyed
And for her Mother's widow'd age
Her cares must now provide.
The Summer's heat, the Winter's cold
Assail'd that faultless form,
And that soft cheek oft pallid grew
Beneath the driving storm
Yet undismay'd by want & toil,
Against her ills she strove,
And in her cottage cheer'd with smiles
The objects of her love.
And while she sooth'd the pining pain
Which prest her Mother dear
Oh [deletion]thus she thought her[/deletion] little Marys [deletion]love[/deletion] [insertion]thus she though[/insertion] [deletion][Her little Mary thus she thought[/deletion]
Her drooping age would cheer.
For sure the duteous child must feel
That Heaven those acts regards
[deletion]By its own means, in its own time[/deletion]
[deletion]The duty Heaven rewards.[/deletion]
And Heaven, in its own way and time,
The duteous child rewards.
