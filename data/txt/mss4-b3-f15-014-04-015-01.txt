My dear friend
++

Ballitore 7th of 12th month 1790

++ I am glad that thou art out on service; it is the way for thee to grow strong, and to get above the little glooms and recurring perplexities & despondencies, which, from various causes, cast down & disquiet the soul. By being thus employed thou wilt, through exercise, become a trained servant, and be made capable to instruct others, thy fellow servants, in the duties of their places and stations, feeding not only the lambs, but the sheep of Christ. Go on, then, my dear friend, be not afraid of the face of man, nor ashamed of the cross of Christ. I repeat it - I have often repeated. For I seem to have little new to say - no matter, if fresh life be on the offering - I repeat that nothing more glorious, more dignifying, more beneficial to mankind, and more worthy of the dedication of all our faculties to espouse and promote, ever was let down from Heaven to Earth. Not only true civilization of manners and sound morality, but life and immortality (i.e. immortal life) and eternal salvation are brought to light, are made manifest through the gospel: desperation a dispensation of which, I doubt not, is committed [page number] 241 to thee, in order to advance, according to thy gift and measure, these great and glorious ends.
I believe many have hurt themselves, and become lame and dwarfish all their lives long by letting in the reasoner and the discourager, considering consulting too much with human prudence and propriety, limitting the spirit which is the holy One; starting aside from services, like an affrighted horse on the road, and being in great fear where no fear is. By continuing diligent, faithful and ^devoted^ thou wilt, I trust, know more and more distinctly the Masters will, and become more and more strengthened to perform it
