My Dear Mary
I have given thy manuscript poems a transient reading (or most
of them) & have ventured to prepose the alteration of a few words but am by no means a
judge of this kind of composition neither coud I prevail on the Doctr to fasten
his attention to it - and by the bye I believe his knowledge not expert [deletion][/deletion]
either & neither of us have time - were we even qualified - yet I wd
not be easy - nay it woud grieve me - if the most beautiful of all
[deletion]I have seen of[/deletion] thy productions in this way - wch I have seen - shoud appear
in print in its present dress - I mean the painful lines
on the existing laws - & the poets sanction of them. Viz
Are not thy laws, O Britain, wise & good,
though oft the sword of justice drops with blood &c
& how do these lines my friend agree with the following
There princely Leopold his sway maintains
mild on the breeze wch. fans his Tuscan plains
Though vigorous justice guards the favoured shore -
He bids the sword of justice slay no more
He deems that natures laws no right woud have
To take that life the [underline]God [/underline]of nature gave.
The two last lines perfectly coincide with my sentiments - and I wish every
author of the present day, & every reader - not to let one line or one word
of a line - escape their close investigation - the world has been too long
amused with fiction & [unclear]fasinating [/unclear]language - and I believe the time is
fully come for every one to declare the truth without fear, & without
the least cringing to concentrate prejudice on domineering authority
God is light & in him is no darkness at all - therefore let no act of
ours under any pretence whatsoever - lift [insertion]even[/insertion] a finger to sanction error
farewell my dear friend - I have written this in great hurry
but not without previously [unclear]ering[/unclear] the subject.
Sam Haughton
PS. I woud recommend thy not publishing
without minute examination
of every word & sentence - this I believe
was the constant practice of thy friend
Cowper - yet errors have escaped even him, nothing
human perfect

are:
save [deletion]that[/deletion][insertion]when[/insertion] stern justice dips her sword in blood.
