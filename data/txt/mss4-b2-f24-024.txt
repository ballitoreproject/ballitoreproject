John Pemberton & William [seal] set off from this thrid [sic] day last for Garriraon [seal], William returned 4 day evening to us & was at meeting here fifth day, in which I thought he was much favoured, both in prayer & testimony. John proceeded to Charlevil [sic] & had a meeting there at the Inn, a large number of people attending & from thence intended to Mallow, & was not determined whether back to Cork again, so William left this town this morning for Waterford, accompanied by my Husband, sister Becky & Jo Dudley, my Mother is gone to dine at Anner-mills; my Abraham is very poorly again, with one of his usual feverish complaints. William desired his kind love to thee, as did Aunt Grubb & her family to thee, Mother & your family, she laughed hearty at thy last letter, Sally Malone is now with them.
	I am out of franks.
