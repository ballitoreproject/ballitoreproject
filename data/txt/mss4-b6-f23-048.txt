That wish obtain'd, life not another shares -
What though her walk with many a flower was spread
Her sharpen'd sight discern'd the secret snares,
Nor dared the doubtful path again to tread.
Oh, say, my Anna - thou her mourning friend,
Whose faithful breast received her latest sigh,
Tell us what comfort did her close attend,
Bid us, like her, assur'd in faith to die.
For Death his pining messenger employs;
He stalks the desolated shades among,
His withering hand the pride of youth destroys,
The bloom is faded & the nerve unstrung.
The tenderest ties he dares to violate -
Here mourns the husband - there laments the [insertion]2[/insertion] bride -
Here filial feelings urge the [insertion]3[/insertion] daughter's fate;
Sinking to earth she joins her mother's side.
There for an only [insertion]4[/insertion] Son incessant flows
The tear of anguish from parental eyes,
While wintry torrents, & the driving snows
Beat on the untimely grave, where Watson lies.
Oh!

Oh! there he lies - & every grace resign'd -
How oft admired! how long must we deplore
That dawning genius, & that liberal mind,
That unassuming, modest merit, more!
Ye blameless shades to happier scenes remove;
Though coward Nature shrinking at the blow
Grasp'd at the fleeting objects of her love,
Ye left a world of vanity & wo.
May we, my friend, our steps in safety steer,
Be not our hour allotted spent in vain,
Press through the shadowy vale with awful fear,
And with these purer spirits mix again! MS.

On the Death of MARY NICHOLSON.
Addrest to Anne Shannon.
Yes - 'twas the voice of grief - my Anna's tear
Falls soft & silent like the dews of night,
And, "Why," she cries, "canst thou so long forbear
Fond friendship's tribute & Maria's right?
"Her whom thou loved - Ah! canst thou thus resign,
"Nor pour thy sorrows o'er the breathless clay"? -
My mourning friend, my tears shall mix with thine,
And the just claims of sacred friendship pay.
While opening life with gayest prospects shone,
Still heard with pleasure, gazed on with delight,
All-fair & fragrant as the flower new blown,
Maria's charms unfolded on the sight.
While affluence, beauty, wit, & youth adorn
With splendid gifts the dear, distinguish'd maid,
Bright as the living lustre of [insertion]the[/insertion] morn
The bloom of health her blushing cheek display'd.
And pleasant was her home - where friendship dear,
Where duteous love, paternal kindness sweet,
Where all that life with social aid can cheer,
Beneath Maria's smile were wont to meet.
But

But (Ah,) how changed my lovely friend I find!
Her beauteous eye a languid lustre gave,
Her downy cheek it's rosy die resign'd,
And ruthless fate prepared her [insertion]e[/insertion]arly grave.
Full on my heart the gush of sorrow flows,
Nor can it's bounds the swelling tide restrain -
And is it thus we meet, thou blighted Rose?
And must we part, & never meet again?
No more thy wit shall charm my listening ear,
No more thy beauty glad my raptured sight -
And cannot all the ties, which hold thee here,
Detain thy spirit from so speedy flight?
Round thee the healthful northern breezes blew -
Was there no healing in their fanning wings?
From Clifden's shade thy silent step withdrew -
Gush'd not for thee her salutary springs?
Patient she proved all human help was vain,
Her feeble frame the tossing tempest bore;
Yet wish'd to reach a father's arms again,
And anxious kindred on her native shore.
