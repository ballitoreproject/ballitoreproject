[21 Oct, 1790]
16th.
I hope it may not be amiss to indulge [insertion]+[/insertion] [underline]my dear friend[/underline] & myself by beginning a letter
thus early, though I cannot for shame dispatch it till I get one from thee, yet thou may see
I was well inclined to be agreeable. A heavy shower caught you I fear the evening you set out,
& perhaps thou could scarce cloke in time - I saw dear Joseph Williams & his son made to run by it
to shelter; they & father & mother went to Jo Haughton's to tea, & I was about to follow, when Betty
Wilson came to drink tea with me; so I thought it was best thou [insertion]went,[/insertion] even on that trifling account, as I
should have been unwilling to have given up thy company the last evening, or to have prevented
thee from the friends, or to have hurt Betty Wilson, who came out of good nature, pitying my stripped
state, & indignant that we should be so treated - I hope I regretted a little missing a meeting there, but had
I caused thee to miss it should much more. Betty & I were brought by Jo Haughton to sup with them
there, & we were very snug & pleasant; Joseph Wms. inclined a little to be jocular, but not so as to embarrass
me much. Yesterday M: Miller kept her bed. M Hudson also poorly, both better now I hope, & sister Lydia,
who was very poorly 5th day night, finely again. I was travelling with you in idea all yesterday,
(Jas. Kathrens[/unclear] hardly knew that I suppose, when meeting me he seemed surprized, & reckoned he had
thought I was gone to Clonmel) the wind was high, & some showers, & the journey long; I long to
hear how thou bore it, being ready to conclude it the longest thou ever took in a day. I figured to
myself your lodging at Anner-mills, & basking in the smiles of the dear, lovely, good women
there, admiring the darling children, & the solid countenance of her, who makes me think of the
little maid from the land of Israel who waited on Naaman's wife, & like her perhaps she will
be instrumental to direct some haughty spirits to seek where to be healed - There too Betty Pope,
sister to A Widdows, ready to laugh & cry for joy at seeing people from Ballitore, will be studious
to wait upon you - And this is a lovely morn for you to enter Clonmel - Clonmel seated on the bank
of the broad river, & sheltered by her mountains! yes thou wilt think of times past when thou
beholds this scene - but little time for thinking till you alight at Brother's (not having escaped
observation passing by uncle Benjns.) there & I hope poor Sister's countenance will brighten, & Sally
will be much relieved - But I partake so in the joy which clamours now at [unclear]Uncle[/unclear] Nancy's
dear neck reddens, & Betty's eyes sparkle with joy, she insists on taking thee immediately to
Suir-island to shew to Jane Tayor (let me not be alarmed) but Nancy must have [insertion]thee[/insertion] to [unclear]Aunt[/unclear] Taylor's
room; there methinks I see the dear woman smile upon thee, raise up her hands - & in the
secret of her spirit pour a benediction. O how dearly I love her! how beautiful she shines thro' age
& infirmity! might such a calm old-age be my lot, I could almost wish to live to be old, but
not on the condition of outliving a certain person. The [underline]widow[/underline] is Aunt Taylor's servant, they will
tell thee her story if thou desires it I believe.
+ Will that do, or must it be [underline]dearest?[/underline]

17th
Since I filled the last side my dear father & mother have been speaking to me apart. Father told me
that tho' he did not mention this matter of our's, yet it was as interesting to him as any affair
of the kind had ever been, or to this effect, enquiring of me how I felt - I told him I had felt a
great weight, which now was much gone off - he said he did not wish me to be gloomy about
it, & [deletion]believed[/deletion] added that, "tho' Wm. may not be so lively, so sprightly, or attentive as others might be,
"yet he is an honest, substantial man" - Ah dear father thought I in myself, thou dost not know Wm.
thoroughly yet, nor shall thou, or any one else, make me [insertion][underline]again,[/underline][/insertion] mistake that beautiful delicacy of conduct,
for a want of that sincere affection of which I [underline]now[/underline] look upon it to be an incontestible proof - My Mother
inquired of me whether upon farther acquaintance (as if our acquaintance was lately begun) I found
any thing disagreeable, or that made me uneasy: I told her the longer I knew the young man
the better I liked him, & she seemed pleased thereat. I found thy night-cap, it was in the wash.
I hope thou may remember what things thou took with thee; I think 3 shirts, 3 stocks 5 pr. stocking,
I know not the number of handkerchiefs, but thou had better take a list & give them to our Sally's care,
for that used to be a [unclear][underline]rec-raw[/underline][/unclear] house, where things were apt to be lost, but don't tell Sally, or any one, that
I say so. I think thou might take a pair of stockings when thou goes to the Mill in thy pockets,
lest thou get wet there or by the way - for I charge thee take care of thyself. Do tell me candidly
how thou art. If thou saw Dr. Davis I was thinking if thou asked him whether, to take about the size
of a pea of Venice Turpentine rolled in sugar now & then, would be proper for thee, but I desire not
to [underline]quack[/underline] thee, believing bodily complaints are often occasioned, & increased by the agitation of the
mind, & to endeavour for composure there the best medicine. Our dear Anna spoke to us to day,
& sweetly she spoke - Dear creature! I believe she repented her refusal of thy offer to take her to Mt.
melick, her going there now seems unlikely. I have been endeavouring to be diligent since thou
went, hope to get my Journal completed soon (I am up in my Diary) & several letters wrote
which lie rather heavy upon me - I had a letter from my cousin Peggy Pike this morning,
they want much to hear from me she reckons, & seemd kindly anxious about me. I suppose
on thy way to Rathroran thou may look at the spot (tho' I think the gate is gone) where
thou & I & Betty Grubb sate the 14/10 mo: 1786. Thou wilt meet many kind friends at Clonmel,
& solace thyself I hope at their fire-sides. Sally Wood thou will not forget to call to see I believe, &
if thou would also call on Betty Wilson (John the shoemaker's wife) it would oblige me, for she is
my particular friend, was our faithful servant, & [deletion]I don't know but[/deletion] was the means of preserving
me from being burnt, perhaps to death, when a child; whether thou art obliged to her for
that we must leave. Surely amongst the dear valuable young women in that quarter
my

my idea cannot rise with advantage I think (I wish I could enough abhor my deficiencies) but
I hope it will not rise with regret that thy choice is made, for I know thou art not given to
change, & do not fear, tho' conscious my inferiority is great. No, I am not afraid of this - but I
fear that I am not deserving of thee, & that perhaps some sudden stroke may destroy the
prospect which looks so fair, &, weak as I am, I shall perish beneath it, for what am I to expect
exemption from such pinching trials, such bitter disappointments as have fallen to the
lot of many favoured minds! Though I much wish thee to enjoy the satisfactions of that
beloved spot, & look upon thee as a comfort to poor Sally & she a support to thee, yet I believe I
need not beg of thee to be as apt a scholar as thou canst (without overdoing thyself) that so
we may have thee with us against Dublin meeting. I long to hear how you got on hope
to-morrow morning will inform yet a little dread mixes too as it often does lest all [unclear][/unclear]
[unclear]well.[/unclear]
19th
This morning brought me my dear Wm's acceptable letter, by which I perceive we both were [unclear]w[/unclear]
each other the same day. Though I find no[deletion]t[/deletion] fault with the shortness of thine, wch. is multum in parvo,
yet I am rather ashamed that mine is so much the reverse. These cruel Mail-coaches delay our letters sadly -
Brother's from Kilkenny only arrived yesterday. I was comforted to find thou bore the journey so well; & was
also comforted by what thou said of dear sister Grubb, having strove to suppress my fear about her at this
time, her uncommon lowness being ready to appear as an ill omen, & it was chiefly to make them partake, &
also because I knew they would know of the letter coming; that I let father & mother see it; at the same
time letting them know they were not always to expect it; therefore let not fears of this prevent thy
being free in communicating any thing thou hast a mind, as I think I could know when thou would
not have thy letters seen. I intend to send this by Dublin, & believe it will reach thee sooner than by the
C: Dermot bag, & then it will not appear here to be so soon, for the frank is to be for 5th day: I could not for
shame write without one, because Hudson, J. Kathrens, the Usher, & any who pleased to look on Brothers chimney
piece, would see the letter in my hand [insertion]writing[/insertion] directed for thee - Let them suspect what the frank encloses if
they will. So I believe thou wilt excuse the delay, thou cannot, I believe, think it neglect. And did not I
tell thee about Jno Grubb? I suppose I thot. as I knew, thou did. What thou tells me about Saml. Neale is very
pleasing - I hope thou hast partaken to thy joy of the company of many dear friends, & that thy heart
has felt the Great Friend near - O may He be ever near! May we live in His fear, & die in His favour!
I thought thou would be delighted at Suir-Island, it is like a little Paradise - the pure spirits there [deletion]some of whom[/deletion] [insertion]all moving so[/insertion]
harmoniously in their spheres, nor is our Betty Grubb the smallest star I think - That unconsciousness of her fine
talents how beautifully it sits upon Jane Taylor! Well mayest thou pity poor John!
21st
Meeting day to which (as I generally do) I went with a wish to be benefited; but alas as is the
almost constant case returned sorrowful; but I fear not sorrowful enough, that my mind was as
the heath in the desert, indeed unfit to speak on such subjects, even to complain. My brother not
yet returned, which makes me somewhat uneasy. Have I done as thou bid me in writing? I
hope

I hope thou hast wrote to these dear companions of thine in Mt. melick who are honing after
thee with fraternal feelings. Need I say I shall be glad to hear now & then from thee? I
am favoured with usual health & good spirits - The rest of us pretty well. Farewell
The Retreat: 21/10mo: 1790. What conclusion abt. thy sister Higgison? M. Shackleton
