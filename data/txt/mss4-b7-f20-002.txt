Ballitore: 17th Sixth-month 1804
Much respected Friend,
I received thy letter of the 8th inst. enclosing two half notes, each
for Â£5 for the use of Owen Finn's widow & children, & also enclosing
a paper which as thou remarks cannot be too highly prized. I take thy
sending me a copy exceedingly kind, & when the hour of affliction & trial
comes, for come it must, this may be made an instrument to inspire resignation
to His will who afflicts not willingly, for there is depicted the quiet
acquiescence of a truly humble mind. The reward was near - & in the enjoyment
of that reward, of how little consequence [deletion]did[/deletion] [insertion]was[/insertion] it [deletion]appear[/deletion] whether the open
of life was allotted to pleasure or suffering. My dear Mother died about three
months ago. For seven years she was nearly lost to us, a paralytick [deletion]affliction[/deletion] [insertion]complaint[/insertion]
gradually affecting the intellect, at length reduced a mind of no common stamp,
to a state of second childhood. Yet the native benevolence of [insertion]her[/insertion] heart beamed thro'
the cloud which obscured her understanding. She was happy (when a painful
state of restlessness went off) as a happy child, & passed through the scenes
state of restfulness went off) as a happy child, & passed through the scenes
of war & subsequent rapine, which her susceptible & timid spirit once could
not have borne, unconscious that any thing had disturbed the once peaceful
village. Her character was respected by the furious armed band [insertion]compy.[/insertion] [deletion]with[/deletion] their
pikes [deletion]in their hands,[/deletion] the Soldier, while plunder & murder were at work,
asked leave of his officer to [insertion]visit[/insertion] [deletion] let him go see how[/deletion] the "old Mistress." & the
midnight robber entered her chamber with respect. She experienced from

my sister (her youngest child) every attention that filial care & filial love
could bestow, [deletion]&[/deletion] [insertion]who[/insertion] while her friends congratulate her release from confinement by
which her health & spirits were in danger of suffering, [deletion]she[/deletion] mourns secretly as a
Mother would for the loss of a sickly child still more endeared by its pining state.
The poor woman whose story has impressed thy mind, being of an active
industrious turn contrived to take an house in the Village & set up
what I suppose is called in England a Chandler's but here an Huckster's shop.
Her eldest son about fourteen has got schooling, & works at day labour when
able, but is already troubled with an asthmatick complaint. Her two daughters
about 11 & 8 & little Owen six years of age, are healthy fine looking
children, but all seem to have a delicacy which will probably unfit
them for labour. The Mother spins in the winter-evenings & makes a piece
of linen every year, I believe, for her family, endeavours to keep them whole
& clean, & has wished, hitherto in vain, to be able to put them to school
The village School mistress might have sate for the picture Shenstone has
drawn. She has educated one generation after another, & many a young
woman has been introduced to a good place or clothed herself at home
by that dexterity at her needle which she has acquired from her instructions
Her terms are a crown p [unclear][/unclear] & two British shillings entrance. She teaches
spelling reading plain work & marking, & some little matter of ornamental
work which though out of date [deletion]in[/deletion] [insertion]with[/insertion] higher ranks [deletion]are[/deletion] [insertion]is[/insertion] prized by the lower.
Thy bounty [insertion]will[/insertion] enable[deletion]s[/deletion] me to send these three children to-morrow to her school.
& if clothing is necessary or when it is I shall apply part to that purpose.
as Thou art so kind as to submit the disposal to my discretion, [deletion]&[/deletion] I hope
it will meet thy approbation that I keep the sum in my own hands
[deletion]&[/deletion] [insertion]that I[/insertion] have not let her know the extent of it, nor given a hint of thy benevolent

intention of a like donation next year. I told her that a Lady in England
having heard her story had commissioned me to put the children to
school & had sent money to me for that purpose. I desired her to call on me
for the money to pay for their schooling as it became due, & give it as from herself
& to keep the matter a secret, as her good [insertion]fortune[/insertion] might excite covetousness or
grudging in her neighbours. The woman is industrious & loved her children
but I feared if I gave her the sum she might apply to some other purpose, &
that the prospect of more might make her relax her industry, or encourage too
enterprizing a spirit in her little business, [deletion]that[/deletion] [insertion]at present[/insertion] she tells me she does not owe
a shilling & her looks & her tears more than her words expressed her gratitude
to thee for a favour so unexpected & of so much value.
I find while thou interests thyself in the distresses of individuals even in
a distant country, thy husband of whose worth & talents Thos. Wilkinson has not
been silent is engaged on a yet more extensive scale of Benevolence. May Heaven
bless him & his worthy undertaking! & surely will not England be blest
when she relinquishes that iniquitous traffick & washes her hands from that
worst of all sins. Will she not obtain the blessing of Peace? Thy mention
of my honoured frd. Melesina is kind. She is still detained in France, & has a few
months since borne a son. Thou desires a sketch of the state of our Country
& thy taking an interest in its concerns feels very grateful. I am ill qualified to
speak on the subject I live quite at home & hear not much of what passes in
our political world I have little powers of judging & by no means a comprehensive
mind. But from my slight observation I think that the Insurrection
which took place in Dublin last summer injured the cause of Rebellion, &
that many eyes were opened on the folly & danger of attempting to subvert our
government, & that were it accomplished we should fall into much worse
hands. Yet were the French to make a good landing I tremble for the consequences

When I last saw our Capital, about two years ago in the interval of peace I
delighted with its appearance, for I was told that in consequence of the Union
grass would grow in the streets of Dublin, & the mouldring houses become [unclear]untenantible[/unclear]
However I never saw the streets more busy or so clean, new houses were rising in [unclear]ma[/unclear]
parts & trade flourished most comfortably. The renewal of war, & the Insurrection
have hurted trade, [deletion]but I suppose tranquillity is restored[/deletion]. I am sorry to say the
traces of war are yet visible in Ballitore and some of its houses still be in [unclear][/unclear]
