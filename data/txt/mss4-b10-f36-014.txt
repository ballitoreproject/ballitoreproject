6th day Evening
1833?
My dear Eliza
My Mother is just
going off in a great hurry
and I have not time to
write much I send some
flowers some of thy geraniums
and a rose off the
tree thou got from Farrell
it is just like the common
red rose at least I see but
very little difference thou
wilt easily know as it is
the only one of that kind
among the flowers, the pansys
are all nearly out of [unclear]blom[/unclear]
the seedlings are too small

to send, there is a very
pretty dark one in [unclear]blom[/unclear]
in thy garden I send a flower
of it this was a terrible
wet day untill four oclock
when it cleared up & Elizth
came out and is taking my
Mother off in ever such
a hurry she will tell
thee all about us here
as I have not time
with dear love to Frank &
Lucy and self believe me
thy affect sister
Selina
Mother had a letter from
[unclear]F[/unclear]. W. M Denroche is
to be in town next week I heard
I did not hear of any letter
from John & Martha since
the one to Edward which
came on second day last
and which my Mother can
 tell thee of if thou did
not hear of it.

Eliza Barrington
