My dear friend
I Recd thy letter of 15th (19th or 20th Inst) with the
nice & (I think) appropriate Elegy on our dear Ben: I mean such parts of
it as relate to him, (the others I fear are unmerited) also the feeling
& instructive extracts from our friend Wm. Lefanu's letters on the
a friend to the whole human-race - and such as these wherever
scatterd can recognize one another - even as face answereth to face
in a glass - there is an old adage that seeing is believing, yet I think
the following part of the sentence is more indubitable, "feeling
has no fellow" sometimes what we are apt to consider as clear vision,
on a clear examination will in reality be no more than a creature
of our own imagination - but when our eyes are opened by the holy unction
they no longer behold men as trees but see them as they really are
Wm. Penn has a maxim - that when he has attended to the sudden
unpremeditated feelings of his own mind he had seldom been mistaken
even in his outward affairs. I have sometimes quoted this sentiment
to John Hancock (whom I think to be one of the wisest & best men
we have among us at this day) and he thinks the safer way wd
be to examain, deliberate, & view things on every side - and to call
in to our aid the divine faculty of reason - because we are so apt
to mistake our own imaginations for certain truths, and I add because
we have so often seen men of the most exalted worth, fine talents
and religious endowments, to have had cause to change their sentiments
same subject - I call him my friend - because I believe him to be

on many Theoretick & Religious subjects - and on both of these
the wisest men have so often differed - that it is hard to say which is in
the right, [deletion][/deletion][insertion]Yet in the latter the way seems so clearly pointed[/insertion] out, when divested
of Priestcraft & the inventions & prejudices of men, that a wayfaring
man tho' a fool (as to this worlds wisdom) cannot err or
mistake it. [deletion][/deletion]The foregoing digressions have led me from, the original
intention of this letter - and it often happens when men get into
the mazes of theology it leads them astray from the nicer feelings
of humanity & brotherly love, so strongly inculcated by our Divine
Master - and while they are disputing about his person - they are neglecting
the weightier parts of his Law, mercy, justice, & Truth.
I unite with thee in sentiment respecting the late object of our sorrow
that he was taken from us at the right time, and the more I
contemplate the scene - the more I am convinced of the wisdom
of infinite goodness, in thus removing him from the Evil to
come - wch I believe woud have enevitably fallen to his lot
neither his body nor mind were fited for the buffeting
scenes of this life - and the malady wth wch he was attacked wd
in all probability [insertion]have[/insertion] encreased perhaps to the degree thy friend apprehended
tho' he had little or no return of it for near three mo:s
before his Release, yet his delicate nerves had Received such a
shock, & [insertion]his[/insertion] heart was so wounded by disappointments, so as to leave
little room to expect the reestablishment of health - I shoud
be sorry thou shd give thyself a moments uneasiness abt thy
of humanity & brotherly love, so strongly incubated by our Divine

apprehended neglect in not [unclear][/unclear] him, and I am sure if his
sweet spirit be [unclear]now concu[/unclear] trouble, it wd be first to
minister to thy comfort & relief -
I have nearly read through H:K Whites two vol: and admire
many of his sentiments & high attainments - he was indeed a
very uncommon young man - notwithstanding I cannot admire
nor receive as truth the hay & stubble with wch many
other parts (are in my opinion) grieviously tarnished - two
or three just occur - viz his placing almost unlimited confidence
in the doctrine of faith - the collection of all the scattered bones from
all the extremities of the Earth at the general resurrection to be united
to their former companions - these & such like are mysteries beyond the
ken of mortals - he also advances the lawfulness for tender consciousness
confirming or complying with the present offensive articles
of [insertion]the[/insertion] church &c indeed it appears to me that notwithstanding all
his attainments & amiable qualities - the bent of his mind was
church preferment, & the support of all her irrational ceremonies
- and the question is whether he might not have been
fully as useful a member of society in the occupation of some
handicraft business (the one he was bred to in his youth [insertion]& an Atty[/insertion] excepted)
such wd indeed ill-suit the delicacy & sensibility of his mind
One of your Chaises is just gone by I must conclude with
dear love to thee &c thy very afft frd Sam Haughton
The time magazines can be [unclear][/unclear] sent. - I [unclear][/unclear] to keep the other
two books a little longer for [unclear][/unclear] this [unclear][/unclear]
