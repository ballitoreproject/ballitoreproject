***
I earnestly desire thy particular attention to thy
Mother. Bear with her infirmities, prevent her wishes, supply
259
her wants, and lighten my absence to her in every respect, as much
as is in thy power. Thou knowest the tenderness of the conjugal tie
and therefore thou wilt bear with me. I am persuaded that thy
husband, who is the very model of goodnature, humanity, and
equanimity, will do his part of this business

Alterations, changes, dismemberments [unclear] will
fall out in families. May we each seek to get settled on
that which is unchangeable; that in whatsoever proportion,
prosperity and adversity, things pleasant and disagreeable,
be mingled in the cup of life, we may take it patiently and
resignedly at the Lord's hand. So will it be a cup of blessings to
us: we shall be strengthened with effectual help, & take courage
