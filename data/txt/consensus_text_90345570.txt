before, and amongst them where
did she bring me but in[deletion]to[/deletion] through
a back door leading into the long
passage from which opened her
own room - I was surprised
and cried out "Oh is it possible
this leads in here" 'Yes' said she
"there's Henry's room, and here is
mine" bringing me over to it
Just as we were peeping in I heard
a step and who should appear but
"Henry" himself Oh said he, have
you not been down here before" "[deletion]now[/deletion]"
[deletion]and[/deletion] " I am learning the geograp[unclear]hy[/unclear]
of the place -" answered I and was
greatly surprised to find where this
door lead to -, whereupon they showed
me the remaining part of the lobby
and as I felt rather ashamed
of been surprised down there I
soon took my departure.
Alice accompanied me to my
dormitory which she said look
rather bleak.- After post hour
