London 18 of 5 Month 1822
Thomas Fisher to Mary Leadbeater
Here I am in the midst of that
great resort & mast of all the earth
Chequer'd with all complexions of mankind
And spotted with all crimes - but have not yet
been here long enough to see much to love, to admire,
or to abhor - John Beckman & I left Edinburgh on
the morning of the 9th & during that day came through
a very wild & romantic part of Scotland, the snow being
several inches deep on the ground - We stopped a few hours
at Dumfries & took advantage of the interval to visit
the beautiful monument to that ornament & disgrace
of Scotland - the unfortunate Burns - I got a glimpse
of Jean sitting in the window as I passed her house,
she is in very comfortable circumstances supported I
believe; by her children. We pursued our way same
evening, principally in the dark to Carlisle, where
we arrived a little after midnight & put up for
the night. Next morning we went on leaving to one
gowns & other curiosities - Oxford is certainly a most beautiful spot,
& the weather & time of year were both remarkably favourable for seeing
it with advantage - The venerable Gothic domes & spires of its buildings
[deletion]had a[/deletion] gilded with the solar rays presented a beautiful appearance
as we glanced at them through vistas of majestic elms, - & lofty chestnuts
in full blossom - There are beautiful walks [insertion]also[/insertion] through avenues of
elms along the river Isis - There is more about Oxford I think to inspire
classical recollections than about any other university that I have
seen - I never admired the academic [underline]gown[/underline] so much - I can hardly
say so much for their square griddles of caps - We left Oxford about
8 in the morning of the 13th & arrived in London about 4 in the afternoon -
having come through a beautiful country - I lodged at a hotel for the
first two or three days but am now settled in a boarding house with
Henry Rickman (John's brother)
On fourth-day I attended a meeting at the city of London Tavern
called by Robert [unclear]Ives[/unclear] for the purpose of submitting to them his plan
called by Robert [unclear]Owens[/unclear] for the purpose of submitting to them his plan
for relieving the Irish peasantry - Here I heard a great deal of his usual
nonsense about [unclear]eq[/unclear] villages & moralizing circumstances, & demoralizing

to sight the romantic part of Cumberland & Westmorland,
but coming nevertheless through an interesting County. Immediately
on entering England, - the contrast between it &
Scotland is very observable particularly in the superior appearance
of comfort which is so strikingly displayed in
the dress habitation & every thing belonging to the English
peasant. I always admired England - but never did
I feel the admiration come so closely home to me as I
have since I entered the country. - J Beckman & I had
talked of stopping a day to visit one or two of the Cumberland
lakes, & call on thy friend Thos. Wilkinson, but John
being [deletion]kept[/deletion] [insertion]detained [/insertion]longer in Edinburgh than he intended found his
time so abridged that he could not spare the day [unclear]consciously[/unclear]   
however we comforted ourselves with the belief
that we should have had very cold dismal weather among
the lakes & mountains, judging from what we were
experiencing on a less romantic toil. We passed through Penrith,
Kendal & Lancaster & arrived late at night at
Manchester Nothing very attractive about Manchester, &
not a little that is repulsive we left it on the morning
of the 11th & had a delightful day's journey through a
circumstances; a crazy-looking man, having the appearance of a friend, said
a few words, & from my description of him, John Rickman conjectures that he
was the famous Dr. John Walker.
Next day, I attended a much more interesting meeting at the Freemason's
Taverne - It was the annual meeting of the British & foreign School
Socuety. The Duke of Sussex, a fat, jolly looking good humoured man
took the chair,- & he was adressed among them by T. Spring Rice, -
(who gave ne the frank for this letter) (William Allen, Wm. Wilberforce
Rowland Hill, Baron de Stael (a [underline]nephew[/underline] I believe, a relation however
of Madame's) who speaks English very well, has rather a [unclear]dark[/unclear] complexion,
& a very good contenance, Lord Ebrington & Randolph a young American -
During yesterday & to day I have been principally occupied in
viewing the city. I have been in St. Paul's, a noble pile, but have
not yet ascended it.
It is time for me to take some notes of thy letter, to which this is
intended as a reply - In it is a quotation from thyself with which I can
most cordially coincide:

very rich part of England. I was particularly delighted
with Staffordshire;- the scenery in that country reminded me
strongly of the most beautiful parts of Antrim & Down -
but the scenery extends over a much [deletion]greater[/deletion] larger
tract of country. We arrived that evening in Birmingham
the town is situated in a very extensive plain without
any thing resembling a hill being within sight. Here
we made first day literally a day of rest, being
not a little fatigued with our journey - We attended
both meetings, at each of which, we had
some words of advice from Anne Braithwaiter
a minister belonging to that meeting. We dined at a friend's
named William Shorthouse I drank tea at Samuel Lloyd's,
a friend who resides a little out of town, very near the
house of Dr. Priestley which suffered so much during
the famous Birmingham riots. On second day morning [insertion](13th)[/insertion]
we left Birmingham breakfasted at Straford-upon-Avon,
where they show the very house in which "the bard of Avon"
was born, & arrived about one o'clock at Oxford. There
we stopped & availed ourselves of the opportunity to visit
the libraries, & other public buildings in the city, we saw
 a vast number of paintings, statues, churches, epitaphs, [unclear]cafe[/unclear] &
"I would not change thou [deletion](friends)[/deletion] I possess
For any other friend beside - "
I consider myself exeedingly [underline]fortunate[/underline],- if it be not impious to use the
word.- in my acquisition of friends - John Rickman is almost like
a brother to me & [insertion]almost[/insertion] all his friends I can adopt as my own. I hope
Deborah enjoys her usual. I should say more than her usual portion of
health.
I hope some of you will write to me while I am here - direct to care
of John Rickman No-12 Bishop's gate street within - & if I can do any
thing for thee here, command any services. I send with this a few lines
to sister Lydia as I may call her by anticipation.
