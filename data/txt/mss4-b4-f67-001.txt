Mt.mellick 14th of 8 mo. 1790.
My dear Sally,
Thou has just done as I wd. have thee
& hast communicated my sentiments exactly
I think - What thy mother says is very true
to be sure, but how short, oh! what more did
she say for I am still in a state of anxiety?
I wd. like to have thy own sentiments & opinion
too on the subject, if agreeable, altho' very
undeserving of even what thou hast done
for me -
It is my sincere wish that there may
not be one step taken but such as will
stand the test: however desirable it may be
to me that such an event wd. take place,
yet if there were not some evident tokens
of approbation attending I wd. hope to be
made willing to relinquish the pleasing
prospect & feel after contentment in my
present state -
I know there is an unerring Counsellor,
but when the poor weak mind is
tossed & distressed how apt & ready is the
enemy

enemy to best & fill it with fears & doubtings
how cordial therefore is the advice of experienced
old age found in the way of righteousness,
this I look for from thy father
& mother - But if the latter was not perfectly
easy & satisfied respecting it. (for
I wd. depend greatly on his judgment)
perhaps it wd. be as well to let it lie &
not expose me any farther, for I am in
some doubt of the propriety even of what
I have done, however I had one reason
for it, which may be as well not to -
mention now - I am quite free in
writing thus to thee, fully expecting
that thou wilt excuse me if I do wrong,
for I love thee sincerely, thou may
find it in my heart for thee, nor do
I think 'tis of my own begetting -
Thy letter was truly comfortable to
me - farewell my dear Sally & let me
hear from thee soon if thou hast freedom
in so doing -
Wm. Leadbeater

For
Sarah Shackleton
Thos. Chandlee
Athy.
