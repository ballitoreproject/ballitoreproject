27 Wednesday. Fine calm and cloudy.
Papa Mama Dick and Nan went to
town this morning on their way to
Orange Hill where they purpose staying
until Saturday. Oh! the delight the
children were in, and no wonder, for
the novelty was great to them and the
anticipation almost equalled the reality.
Our visitor has flown also - went in
with them, as she declined staying
longer on account of her singing lessons.
28 Thursday - just like its predecessor and
most delightfully mild. Margt and I
drove over to see Grandmama whom
we found in bed - had not been well
since Sunday, and obliged to send
for Doctor Moss. However as Aunt
Eliza seemed to consider her better to day
and she was able to talk to us when
we went up to see her, I dont think
there is much cause for anxiety.

by Tinnehinch, the first [deletion]ride[/deletion] we have
taken together this many a long day.
