Richmond 11th of 5th month 1827.
My dear Sarah
I write in haste and to hope
Rose's coming. If convenient as the Child's
maid is married and gone. I expect Rose
will do the housemaid's business until the
children get used to her. We are busy completing
a little nursery - so then would call it at least
and are rather in sixes and sevens. James
took the liberty of giving thy name - & address
to a very particular friend of ours; that
her parcels from Liverpool might be sent
to your house for she had, not at present
in Dublin, & she lost some by their lying
at the various steam boat offices. If there
should be any money given of course it
will be repaid - but I believe it is not
necessary & perhaps John will manage this
for us. Jane Hunter - wife of the manager
of the Provincial Bank is this friend
and thou knows her husband is James's
Master - beside she is a very kind agreeable
woman, and one to when we are all in
some degree attached. If thou or Edwd
fit her next summer I expect but that is so much
the better for she is well shod at present - she has
remarkably small feet - & her limbs are modelled
after my mothers - at least I often think so - I wish
thou could see her - she is very bonnie - Though not
handsome - & she is so roundly formed that she is
greatly admired. Jose is grown very coarse & ordinary
but he is very healthy & therefore I am most thankful.
I was greatly disappointed about Rose - but I cannot
help it - I think she would not have been
sorry if she had trusted to me. however I would not
press her as we live so far away from her friends and
connections Mary's gift of a frock was extremely nice & very
tasteful - it is greatly admired - but I value it from other
causes very highly. - thou knows them. I heard that Richd
had presented his marriage - wert thou at it? And to whom
is Josiah Nayle going to pledge himself? I have partly engaged
another servant - but I can hardly tell thee how disappointed
I was about Rose, I hope I did not praise the children
too much excuse me - but I said what I felt. Is Edwd
gone from thee to London town Oh! that I had thee here
in the interim. are any of your girls thinking of changing

does not like this arrangement say so freely
& James will have them sent to the Toothunters.
account & the bill of the spices as they belong
to separate accounts. Any balance due to
thee my father can pay. I am afraid I
am very troublesome to thee. Hast thou Debh.
with thee still? and will she come to me?
Ah, do write to me. I was greatly disappointed
at not getting a line from any of you by the
friends returning. How does dear Richd. look
I am expecting him here I hope John is
not entirely disgusted with Limerick love
of money. James has much more time
now than he had when [underline]"P.J."[/underline] was here.
Our young ones are very gay & hearty in spite
of my care, Mary's fair neck is growing brown
I suppose thine are tanned also, as both the
sun & sea air are beaming & blowing on them.
Jose is welcome to grow as black as he likes
but I would not like to have a girl spoiled
John told me that Johnny was handsomer
than Willie, is it so? for I thought Willie the
prettiest of all, & very like Selina
I am very busy rigging the children out for the
I would thank thee to send my
their state? I send this by an opportunity to be
slipped into the penny post. It is I believe months
since I heard from Ballitore - Ah! in how may ways I miss
our dear mother & think it is nearly a year since we
lost her! Did my father look pretty well? - When shall
I see him - not for a very long time I fear. So Debs
missed seeing E [unclear]Foy[/unclear] entirely - or did she see her in
London? I am in haste to send this to town so
dearest Sarah, take my farewell
[underline]LJ Fisher[/underline]
We expect Thomas & John Rickman
after the London meeting.
I heard a Limerick friend remark who was present
that E Malone went through the presentation with
[underline]remarkable sang froid[/underline]. I suppose the procession
looked very nice & fine - tell me if it will indeed
I wish Richard into all happiness - most sincerely
"of silver brooch & bracelet proud" bring in that
quotation where thou likes. I am a great quoter. so
don't mind me. Ah, I could talk to thee for hours.
Did I give thee my thanks for all thou sent me, & so

summer, & preparing for the stranger - beside the
fruit always keeps me very busy, & after my
confinement I shall have my portion of picking
& preserving & selling, & giving away. But Sally
does a great deal of work for me. - all the
dainty & fancy work, whilst I [underline]wallop[/underline]. Ah! that
I could see thee here, & now I almost give it
up entirely, entirely. My dear love to Edwd. I
thought he would have recruited here, & I wd
have had great sport. Our garden is growing lovely
& is now repaying me for my four years care.
I never before could enjoy it this time of year
[unclear][/unclear] the summer of Jose's birth for I was
ill or from home

(Dost thou often visit Hannah S. -
& Mary Dawson. - I am sure thou would like
her, from what I know of her. She likes thee,
My love to them both. I do not know what
I should have done, if she could not have
gone to Hannah just at this time. so I feel
proportionatly grateful to her & hers. I think
bad of allowing thee to pay postage for this
& yet, I think it would look stiff to postpay
a letter to thee. I beg thou wilt write a few
lines to say by what conveyance Rose comes
& on what day - as I should have a person to
quickly. Then don't want them. The old poplin
looked beautiful I really stared when I saw
it - it was done so quickly & so well.
Tell me most intimate particulars about the
children. - Father Fisher was telling me of Maggie's
speeches - he praised their stout looks greatly.
Adieu

meet her in town & convoy her out. We are now
reading "Hollantide" or Munster tales, & we like them
Have you read the "Boyne Water" it found great
favour in our sight. We liked it better than
any one of the OHara tales. We began "English
in Italy" but did not like it enough to carry
us through more than one tale. Indeed we read
very little & now the fine weather is come shall
not read any I suppose. 22nd. I was interrupted
by the arrival of thy valuable dispatches - all which
came safely to hand, & all were greatly to my
mind & admiration. - the Albinet looks extremely
handsome made up & is greatly admired.
Thanks for the nice shoes for Polly - they will
