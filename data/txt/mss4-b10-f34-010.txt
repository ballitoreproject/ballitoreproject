Monday
Dearest Wife
I am sorry
to hear you have
not fixed a time
for
coming
home
yet - I thought you
might have come
to-day day or to-morrow
- my Mother thinks
you would be more
in your place at
tending to your
child
& husband.
Mc Cornish sent
in a bill for the
room
charging
 [unclear]301[/unclear] for the painting
& [unclear]61[/unclear]
for scraping off
The old papers
I only gave him
something on a/c
there is also a

Bill from Dr. Patton
which I enclose.
I dined at Elenfield
yesterday
Mother & Rachel
were also there
-  Johnny was to
Sail to-day from
Marseilles -
To morrow is
the Winter Fair
here and I suppose
I shall have
some folks to
dinner - I have
the corned beef
& a loin of mutton
for them - Just
12 months since
I took the Rheumatism
- you
ought to be here
to keep me warm
least I might take
it again -
It's blowing very
hard this minute
the frost has
entirely disappeared -
Have the apples
arrived - I sent
them on Saturday
I am going to
dine at Mr Walker's
to-day
ever yours
