8[underline]th[/underline] Second day - Margt.
did not get up till after
dinner. F. L and I walked
to Loyd's new house to
see its advances towards
completion and were
quite pleased with it.
After dinner I gave
T a ride on the filly -
but she did not I think
enjoy it so much as
our previous ones -
and no wonder when
I was not mounted [unclear]also[/unclear]
[unclear]The[/unclear] evening was so warm
I found it hard work
racing after the filly but,
[extra line]
enjoyed it for all that.
