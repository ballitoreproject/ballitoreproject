My dear Father,


        I am deeply indebted to thee for thy last & former kind favours, which I fear I cannot reply to as I expected & wished. James Lecky being in town I want to send this by him, as my Samuel seems to doubt his going as he intended to the meeting, & Mary having given it up, I am in haste to send this, I thought to have time enough, this evening to have written by them, I called to see poor, dear Mary Dudley to day & found her discouraged, the weather has been so severe, & her own health of body so precarious. We were longing to hear of dear Mary, she knows we wish ^her^ & her Husband every blessing consistent with divine Wisdom to bestow, & we hope he will bless & prosper the union our dear love, & congratulations attends them. The account of the fire at Brother Chandlees was near to us, how did it [paper torn] Haughton did not call to us; going in the [paper torn] to me, I know how she is & I can sympathize with [word crossed out] ^her^, I am much so myself, full of care, & cumbered about many things, I am as if I hardly knew which foot to put foremost, I did go to Limerick, & did not repent it, because I thought I got a Morsel of substantial bread, & tho it may seem to be the bread of adversity, yet if ^of a^ heavenly nature it does nourish up & sustain the immortal Soul, I did feel a little capacity I thought to lament for our fallen state, & I thought at times the Master seemed to draw near, Oh it is enough if he joins the company in a state of sadness. Since my return I have been not very well in health, & much perplexed with outward things, which perhaps would not perplex many others, but a little thing hurts the hidden life, & clouds the spiritual understanding. I send enclosed a letter, I suppose on the subject of the National visit: wouldst thou have me go with you to the North? I know not that I would be of any use, & perhaps would be an incumbrance, but friends thought fit to mention my name, & shall I go? I liked to hear of your family visit, we are about to make apointment [sic] on that subject. I know not who will be enlisted. I wish the right ones [sic] may. Sarah & Betsy I hear going on in Cork, Edward Hatton says, the Master is with them. Sister Sally Jo has been poorly, but is better
        Our dear love attends you all. In hast thy affectionate
                Margaret Grubb
