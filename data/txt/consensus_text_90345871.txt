so few seemed to take an interest in it
that Mrs Barter gave it up and [deletion]t[/deletion]
offered to have tea ready for us at Blarney
Castle if we chose - so tea we had there
and very pleasant it was indeed & a
most beautiful evening! Mrs Barter offering
to lend me their phaeton - so I drove and
the two Boxes accompanied me also-
Susannah Greeves - We had a sensible
old grey charger - so had no adventure
except on our return home when the
horrid animal stood on poor Mr Wrights
toe - and he so politely leading us along.
What a picturesque group we formed
at tea time! the scene a lovely woodland
one on the borders of the lake - a tent
pitched! a fire lighted under the trees -
horses and cars [insertion]and cows[/insertion] scattered about, a cloth
spread on the ground with a plentiful supply
of cups saucers - tea , bread, cake, &c &c &c &c
& plenty of ladies and gentlemen [insertion]of all descriptions[/insertion] some
sitting some standing -. Mr Barter
son and anon playing his bartrophone.
The performances commenced with a walk
through Rock Close and finished with
a dance on the grass - Mr B musician.
