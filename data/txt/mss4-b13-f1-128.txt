Seventh-day morning after breakfast we went into town, first call’d at Thos. Harris’s, where Sarah had to drop a few words of caution & encouragement: - call’d next to see Richd. Allen, who is confined with a sore leg, the sitting here was trying to me, for several reasons Sarah spoke a good deal to their daughter: - from thence to Joshua Humprhis’s who seems to be near his awful close by whom ST was engaged feelingly to pray, even that sin & omissions might graciously be forgiven. From thence Sarah went to John Morriss [sic], where, after calling to see Nancy Sinton, (a great grant looking woman,) & some other of my acquaintance I joined her, & after dining & taking tea agreeable with dear Betsy, we returned to our lodging, where I much miss the company of dear J: Abell.
