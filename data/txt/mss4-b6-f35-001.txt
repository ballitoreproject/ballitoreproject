Dublin 3rd of 3rd Month 1812
Believing that my dear friend Mary
Ledbeatere is ever ready to serve the distressed,
I have volunteered to trespass on her kindness,
or rather to solicit an extension there of, as
thro' her means considerable relief has been experienced.
I expect that thou may remember
that some time since thou gave an ointment
to our mutual friend Sarah Sproule, which
has been famed for curing sore heads. - I was
making her a visit one day when her children
were under this distemper, & expressed my
surprise that they had so soon got better,
adding that I had two little relatives one

of whom had laboured under it for near five
years, the other three, & that the disorder seemed
to resist every remedy.- - On my giving
this dismal account S:S: gave a bit of thy
ointment, which was soon administered, and
it has had a most admirable effect.- - I
can truly say that if thou wouldst be so
kind as to send me some of it I shall be
extremely obliged.- - The mother of those poor
children is my first concern, their situation is
an addition to her afflictions, which are many
and grievous, even to an extent seldom to be
met with.- - almost too much for human nature
to bear, where the consolations of deep experience
in religion have not taken hold of
the mind, how truly desirable it is, [insertion]under such trials to have secured to our selves that friend, who sticks closer than a brother[/insertion] may we
my dear friend who I hope are mercifully

made sensible here of, endeavour to say amen
to every trying dispensation which the Great
master may think fit to administer, knowing
that afflictions spring not out of the
ground, but are from him who intends them
for our refinement. - I hope thou wilt excuse
this hasty scribble, this is the first
letter I have attempted to write for near
two weeks, having been much indisposed
[unclear]with[/unclear] a bilious complaint which affected
my liver.- With affectionate regards
for thee and thine I remain thy assured
friend
