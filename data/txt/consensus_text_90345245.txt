pretty ramble so near - the river nearly all
the way was bordered on one side by
a nice wood which reminded us
greatly of the Dargle, particularly, where
as was frequently the case, the opposite
side was wooded also. Polly received
a unexpected letter to day from Kitty
Grafton.
3rd.. Another fine day. Thomas Henry
drove us to see Charles and Anne Wakefield -
the latter we found confined
to her room by a cold, so did not go in
tho' pressed to do so by C W. On our return
paid another visit to Mrs Johnston wife of
the curate. Poor Polly had a bad head=ache,
and was not at all well on reaching
home - a long sleep after dinner was of
great use to her however.
4th. Rain again. Miss Matthews and Miss
Patten called - we did not go out - The
former is going with her parents to leave
Tandragee, and intends, after passing a
few weeks at Kingstown to return to England
