on Quebec) which had calmly reposed for that time,
within the walls of the City, have been lately removed
at the expence of this State; & on the 8th Inst. the
estimation in which his memory is held, was evinced
by a grand Funeral ceremony, in which all
the principal men of Newyork, several old Revolutionary
officers, the different Societies, Clergy, &c &c
united, in paying him the last sad tribute. -
As he was an Irishman, our Countrymen were
particularly conspicuous in the Procession.
They carried an immense Harp, draped out
with flowers, but covered with black silk,
Before it, was a White flag, on which was written -
"The Hero fell in his Fame" - "Great is the Joy of our
Grief."- & following it, was a large green flag,
edged with Black, having the name of "Montgomery."
written in gold letters, across the centre of it -
His widow still lives in this City, & I understand
her feelings were highly gratified, by the removal
of his remains, in this manner.- . . . . . .
I have just received a letter from Thos.
Fisher, wherein he asks "hast thou ever received a letter
from M Leadbeater dated about the middle of [underline]first[/underline] month"?
By this I perceive my supposition that thou [deletion]me[/deletion] wrote it
in [underline]third[/underline] month, was erroneous - the vessel which brought
it sailed from Dublin latter end of 3 [underline]month[/underline], when

I conclude [underline]friend Tommy[/underline] (if 'twas to him thou
enclosed it) kept it by him for some weeks before
he thought proper to forward it. - What favours
this opinion of his Carelessness, is, his letters to me
are generally dated 1 month to 6 weeks, prior to
the sailing of the vessel which brings them.
I presume he is too much of a Philosopher to
mind such trifles - therefore, a reprimand might
be thrown away on him.
When I commenced this
letter, I really had no idea of extending it, to
such an unwarrantable, & to thee, tiresome length
but must excuse my loquacity by placing it
to the pleasure derived from writing to one
whom I have always regarded with warm
friendship. Assuring thee, however, that if thou
gratifies me with another Epistle, I shall keep
my pen within proper bounds when again
addressing thee, & desiring to be particularly
remembered to all my Ballitore friends,
not forgetting A Taverner & H Haughton -
I remain truly
thy affecte friend

I delivered Wm Grattan his letter -
I believe he is doing very well.

If my old nurse Dolly be still alive I should
like to be remembered kindly to her - I have
heard nothing of Peter Widdows lately.
