Laydis new house, Grandmama having
expressed a wish to see it. The day
being very hazy, she did not see the
fine view to advantage, which was a
pity. They dined with us but did
not stay to tea. Papa Mama and I
drove down to Kingstown soon after
the former to see Uncle Ebenezer who
is at present lodging at Windsor
Terrace. I had been invited to spend
the day at Ballitore Cottage with the Down[unclear]s[/unclear]
so thought I might as well take the
opportunity of going there. Met
Polly there and spent quite a pleasant
evening. As John called for us we
did not accept their kind invitation
to stay the night; but came in with
him, and prevailed on Georgina to
accompany us. We met Jas Pim's
three daughters on our way in and
had their company as far as Westland
Row -. Took a car here - and found
poor lonely Margt waiting for us.
