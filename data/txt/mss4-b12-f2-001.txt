My Dear Friend.
I was delighted some
time ago to receive a letter from you
and find that you had not forgotten
me. I often think of you and
our pleasant little visit to your
father's beautiful country seat.
It is most pleasant to find
myself so kindly remembered by
you. Often and often have I felt
a strong inclination to write to you;
but could not really make or find
the time. I am so much occupied
In the first place I belong to a "Lady's
Loyal national League" which has for
its object the rolling up of a petition
to Congress, praying that "[underline]honourable[/underline]
Body" to pass an Act of immediate
emancipation in all the States.
This petition is to be signed by
a million loyal women. It

is thought that such a petition
will have great effect upon
Congress. You will readily perceive
that such a League involves a
great deal of work and a vast
amount of writing. Then social
life in America entails so much
care. One has to go out a great
deal and entertain so much;
particularly if you represent a
cause. You must get people in
rapport and this is only done by
the interchange of social amenities
Sometimes I am so fatigued and
half work out. I came very near
going over to England this Spring
for a few months rest, but when
it came to the hour of departure,
I could not leave my country at
such a critical moment. My
friends in London were clamorous
for me to go to them for the
summer and as a party of
friends were going over I had an
excellent opportunity; but for the
present all such plans are
nullified. I must be here, on the
spot, for the actual work - and
next winter I shall go to Washington
to be present when the petition is
presented. It will be a monster
affair and we think it will require
4 [underline]negro men[/underline] to carry it into the
House!! What a grand sight
it will be, to be sure!
We - abolitionists, are quite proud
of the behaviour of the Black
regiment at Port Hudson - The
war still goes on - and we hope
the day of [underline]honourable peace[/underline] is
not far off. We have an abiding
faith in Providence and know
that the righteousness of our cause
will ensure us ultimate success.
It is necessary for us to be deeply
ploughed with care and humbled
to the dust for our past sins &
injustice. Feeling the truth of this,
we bear reverse with calmness
knowing that the hand which
punishes us, now, is the red,
right arm of justice, Smiting

even while it loves -
I have lately had a nice trip
to Niagara Falls - which though
often seen always looks new and
grand and beautiful. I wish
you could come to America
for a visit. Just now we are
having such fine weather, not
so warm as it has been - The
skies are cloudlessly blue, the
air warm & soft as Italy - with
just a bracing tone of the salty
sea. I never enjoyed nature
& climate more than I do this season.
We made a short excursion
last week up the Hudson river &
the country looked marvellously beautiful.
How are your sisters? You told me
of the marriage of one of them - If
not too late, congratulate her for
me. I have just recd wedding cards
from our consul to Brazil who has
married a Spanish countess with
a frightfully long, hard name -
Do excuse this scribbling. I must
offer you, en verite, the excuse of that
witty French woman Madame SeveÄ©gne
"Excuse mon griffonage; Je t'ecris comme
un chat, mais je t'aime comme un chien"

can you except the excuse with the reason and is it
not true n'est
ce-pas? Do
write to me when
ever you feel the
least inclined
and believe me
always Your affec
friend.
Mattie Griffith
