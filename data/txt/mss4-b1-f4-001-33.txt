R.S. to his Daughter Chandlee.
Boston, 7th of Seventhmonth, 1784.
My Dear Deborah
Having some leisure on my hands at this place, I thought I would
devote some part of it to thee, well knowing thy affectionate regard and
attention to thy near connexions, and the low opinion which thou entertainest
of thyself. These are qualities which never fail of procuring and preserving
the love and esteem of our friends, and these I think thou possessest in
a great degree ***
May I and all mine dwell low in humble fear, feeling daily
after a sense of the operation of truth in our minds, that we may not be
as those who live without God in the world; but, witnessing from season
to season, in this manner, a renewal of our acquaintance with that which
is good, may be supported and enabled to run with patience the race
which is set before us respectively. In this world we shall and must have
trouble: in the evidence of Divine approbation alone is true peace **
Mary particularly piques herself at being present at the Yearly
Meeting of London, where the first Women's Yearly Meeting was established.
