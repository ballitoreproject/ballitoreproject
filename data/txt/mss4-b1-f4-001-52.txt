But we cherish a hope that it is consistent with Infinite Wisdom to
prolong his stay awhile among his near connexions and the militant church
which, if it be the Lord's will, we earnestly desire. We charge thee with
our very affectionate regards to the dear and worthy companion of our
patient friend : her sufferings and anxiety on his account must
be great **

*** Farewell, my beloved Lydia, till I see thee.
May thy spirit be sustained and comforted, amid the exercising conflicts
from within and from without, with which it may be tried!
Thou knowest where effectual help and strength lies : it lies deep;
and we have no capacity of our own whereby we can bring it up.
Our business, then, is patiently to wait, and quietly to expect; and
if the fault be not our own, thus steadily looking and leaning, the
gracious Lord will, in his own (best) time, administer relief, encouragement
and help.
