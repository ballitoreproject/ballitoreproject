My Dear friend
I have waited this oppertunity, to say
I consider myself much oblidged by thy kind & truly accepble.
letter - which I woud have endeavour'd to reply to before,
but [insertion]for[/insertion] the prospect of its soon offering - It is with much
diffidence &embarisment I take up the pen to address thee,
Altho' desireable thy correspondance, & my mind cloathed
with affectionate Esteem towards thee. -
If my dear Brother James, or some of his relatives did
not inform thee, I think they shoud - That we left Stramore
with an Intention & desire to take Ballitore in our way
here - but was prevented by a letter recd. from Father on
our arrival in Dublin, that [deletion][/deletion] [insertion]detained[/insertion] us there, & made us
afraid to delay on the road - At the time my thoughts
were so filled with dear Stramore & my heart so sore

from the recent seperation, that I did not seem [insertion]then[/insertion] to regret [deletion]the[/deletion]
the disappointment so much as I have [underline]often done since -[/underline]
I should [deletion]much[/deletion] enjoy greatly an oppertunity of conversing
with thee about [deletion][/deletion] [insertion]it,[/insertion] & its still dearer inhabitants,
[deletion][/deletion] were I to follow my inclination in dwelling on the
Subject. It would take up more time than I have now
spend in writeing - we got but a few hours notice for
Marks setting of, since which have been much hurried
in the Office & oblidged to defer setting about this - untill
bed time, which I am oblidged to go to pretty early for fear
of disturbing Mother, as I lie in the same room with
her - & she is but delicate this being only the third day
since she was instrumental in bringing to the World
a beautiful Daughter - which with herself are thro'.
[unclear]fad[/unclear] as well as can be expected - I long much
to hear [insertion]pticularly[/insertion] how dear Anna Tavernor is? & how this trying
Season agrees with her? - Please remember me

to her in the most affectionate manner, & were it not for
the close engagement of mind I have experienced since my
return home - I woud have long since addressed her, which
I hope soon to be able to do - & plead my excuse -
Isend by Mark carefully sealed a small matter Iborrowd.
from thee - for which accept my thanks -
I dont know when I wrote a letter that needs so
many apologies as this, which Ientreat may be
seen [underline]by none[/underline] but my dear Anna - & after [unclear]requ[/unclear]
thou will [insertion]make[/insertion] allowances for its many faults, & [deletion]make[/deletion]
my dear love acceptable to thy dear Father & Mother,
Brother Abm. & Lydia remain thy affec
