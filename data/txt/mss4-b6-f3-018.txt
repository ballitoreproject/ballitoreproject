August 17th 1811
My dear Friend
I hope you will excuse me for having
so long delayed to thank you for "Deloura," &
for your short letter; however even the two lines were
acceptable, as I am always very glad to hear from
you - Deloura was inserted in the last Magazine,-
who was the author? Mrs O'Neil's poem was not
inserted, as it has been very frequently published
The Earl O'Neil is also too well known in this
neighbourhood to be a very worthless character, & one
that the Proprietors of the Magazine could not
praise; they therefore thought the poem could not
be published in their pages. Mrs O'Neil possessed
some genius, but her extreme thoughtlessness led
her into many errors - Her husband treated her
very barbarously - Have you ever read her beautiful
Ode to the Poppy written a short time before her
death? - She then keenly felt distress of mind when
she conjured the Poppy to
"Close those weary eyes in gentle sleep,
Which never open but to weep."
And then wishes that "Sorrow's pallid votary," might
dare, - "Without a crime that remedy implore
Which bids the spirit from its bondage fly."
I will send you the poem if you have not seen it -

We have been a good deal disappointed in not
receiving the "Cottage Dialogues" - My Father wishes
to have 30 of the Irish edition, & 4 of the English
for himself, & 20 of the English edition for a bookseller
in Belfast - Archer, one of our principal booksellers,
has received four copies of the Dialogues from
London, & he says that he could sell a great number
of the English edition if he had them [underline]immediately,[/underline]
but delay will diminish the sale -
He had not known of the Irish edition, & he applied
to me to write for liberty to print the dialogues
separately, to be sold instead of half-penny
ballads, as he thought they would be of material
advantage to those who could not afford to purchase
the book - Archer has paid me for 27 copies of the
Anecdotes - please let me know how I shall send
you the amount. Another bookseller owes for 18
copies & I cannot get him to pay me - The remainder
of the Anecdotes will I hope be sold in time
I have also sold some gloves, & I will send the
money I received for them when I know how you
would wish it sent -
Have you read Barlow's Columbiad? I have
been highly delighted with it - The versification is
not smooth, but the sentiments are excellent, and

patriotic, without the mixture of insipidity which
[insertion]is[/insertion] so commonly to be met with in modern publications.
I have also been much interested in reading Dugald
Stewart's Moral essays - I particularly admired the
concluding essay on Intellectual acquirements -
My Father's health is not improved - The pain
in his chest, & the difficulty of breathing is still very
great - I cannot avoid being extremely uneasy
about him; it is very distressing to see those we
love suffer pain - All the rest of the family are
well - I hope to hear from you soon, & tell me
how all the invalids in Ballitore are - I often think
of you [unclear][/unclear], & I sincerely sympathize in the
distressing anxiety you must have felt on
seeing so many invalids in Ballitore - I was greatly
disappointed at not seeing Betsy in the North this
summer as I had looked forward with great pleasure
to the prospect of her visit, but I could not be so
selfish as to say much to her about coming when
I considered all the anxiety of mind she must
have felt of late - & how much of her time is occupied
with important objects - Please give my dear love
to her, & tell her I intend writing to her soon - I must
now bid you good night, as it is very late, & all the
family were in bed before I began this letter - I make
less sleep do me, as I like to read or write after supper,
as the domestic cares are then over for the day, & I
am not interrupted - & I enjoy a little leisure. [deletion][/deletion]

in the evening after having been busy all day with
various employments - Please give my dear love
to Elizabeth, & to Deborah when you write to her -
I should be extremely sorry that they would forget
their, & your ever affectionate S Hancock
18th Betsy will thank you to forward a letter she has
written to Dunleary - She has been inoculated [insertion]this morning[/insertion] for the small
pox - she has had the cow pox, but she is very much
alarmed lest she would take the small pox, & we
thought it best to have her inoculated altho' we are
almost certain she will not take the disease, yet it will
be pleasant for her to have a feeling of security -
Do not delay a single day that you can [deletion][/deletion] avoid to send
The Cottage Dialogues, as they are already too long in coming -
Several of our acquaintances have got copies from London,
& of course Archer's sale will be diminished -
