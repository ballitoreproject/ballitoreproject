8 Friday Ditto. Went down to Mrs
Gaskin and found her sick in bed.
Poor Tim Owens is laid up too. it seems
to be a feverish cold that is going.
Heard lately that Hannah Jane Palmer
has another child and Mrs [unclear]Twamley [/unclear]
a daughter. wonderful! She was
married before to Stephen Wilson for
nearly 20 years I believe and had
no child. What a treasure this will be.
9 Saturday. Charlie honoured us
with his company this evening which
twas as[/unclear] consequently enlivened by a little
music and singing. He seldom
comes now on a week day.
10 Sunday. Charlotte Strangman
returned to day with Papa and
Mama from meeting, as they thought
the change of air might improve
her present delicate health.
