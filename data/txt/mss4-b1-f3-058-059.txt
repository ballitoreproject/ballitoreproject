					Ballitore 15th of Eighthmonth 1777.
				*** Thy father, M. and I set out for Moate fourth-day week. Our journey was attended with some little difficulties, but we were greatly favoured in getting safe home; and, as our motive for going was, to be found in the way of our duty, I hope it was acceptable. The public service of the meeting seemed chiefly to rest upon that faithful servant, Elizabeth Robinson, though most of the ministering-friends who were there, had acceptable service also. All tended to the one thing; that is, to promote reformation among the professors of truth, that they might become professors of it; which would be of more real value to us, by far, than any or all earthly enjoyments. So thou, my dear child, seek early and late for this pearl of price! Forget not the constant, inward watchfulness unto prayer, that thou mayst be preserved from the many temptations that await thee on this stage of life. Beward, lest thy mind, through unwatchfulness, be too much drawn away after trifling objects. I do not mean admiring the beauties of the creation, which leads to adore the Power that caused them to be; neither the improvement of sensible, useful members of civil society; but many things that may present in variety of company, conversation, &c. though I hope thou art not in the way of such things, as many other young people are, who are much to be pitied. And those who are favoured with a careful education, have cuase of humble thankfulness to the Author of all our blessings, that he was pleased to cast their lot in the way to be directed aright, while so many of our brethren, by creation, remain in darkness; not being directed to look to the light to be their leader, and the anointing to be their guide.
						E. S.
