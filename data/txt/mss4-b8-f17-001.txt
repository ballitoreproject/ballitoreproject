Dublin 13th of 7th mo 1826
My dear father
I cannot say how much obliged I am to
thee for forwarding my coming home this
morning notwithstanding the opposition of so
many dear friends Willie bore the journey
very well sleeping most of the time, [unclear]John[/unclear]
will have told thee how we took the coach
I went outside for a short way to enjoy the fresh
air but got settled comfortably within before the
rain came on we were set down at my
uncle Wright's door & Sam kindly went for a
Coach for us so that we got home without any
wet to the great surprize & joy of Edw who was
not as Deborah conjectured, on the road to
Ballitore, , There has been great rain here 
which put the people into good spirits

I hope we shall soon see thee & Eben -
give my [insertion]dear[/insertion] love to my aunt S & tell her I was
sorry I could not bid her farewell - this
is not worth postage but I was afraid
you would be uneasy about the child
I hope to see Johnny tomorrow I found
all well here, the kitchen greatly improved
I hope thou wilt have a pipe by the fireside
there soon it is almost equal to
Moone except that there is no arm chair -
tell Elizth. with my dear love that I will attend
to her commission tomorrow I intend
& will write to her the first opr.
thy affect. daughter SB
my dear love to Mary &
Abby
