to town this morning so Philip

they had gone - Richard &
I took a walk up to the potato
field where they were very busy,
it was quite a long walk
for little Dick who seemed to
have a great propensity to
tumble, which he did five or
six times I think poor child,
however fortunately the falls
were soft ones and did not
bring forth tears. After dinner
I set to work and transplanted
the best of my stocks which
job I have been long threatening
Philip, did not come in to
tea till past 8 O'clock I think
as this was
as this was paying night,
9th. Seventh day - Busy all
the
the morning and did
this
of the
long
