Clonmel 26th of 10thmo. 1790.
My dear M.S.
I received thy 2 letters & was uneasy that
I said so much to thee about writing, as I might easily 
have judged that it was not for want of regard or wishing
to gratify me, for thou hast given me many
proofs to the contrary, but for the look of the
thing, which I would have thee to attend to, I think,
& to use thy own freedom in that as well as
other respects - I was a little sorry I told thee I 
was not well in my last, but thou likes I shod.
tell the truth; & when it is the case [insertion]i.e. when I am sick[/insertion] for a few
days, I am greatly cast down & distressed, more
on thy account than on my own, for I do think
it a pity that it shod. fall to [underline]thy[/underline] lot to have
the care of such as me - Thou desires me to
tell thee how thy Sister Grubb & I agree; I hope
we agree very well, she seems more cheerful
& better these fews days back than when I
wrote last, I hope it may continue to be the
case till her time comes for her to be eased
from her burden; & as for what Betty, Nancy
& [underline]Aunt[/underline] Taylor say, I think I can't give thee
any particular account, save that they seem well

well pleased at what has happened, & breathe
out the language of great affection for us -
I spend a good deal of time at the School with
dear Betty who highly entertains me - I am
to dine this day at Anner Mills with [underline]Uncle[/underline]
Benjamins family or the most part of it 
& I expect to see the Mills by it - I believe Sally
intends sending a letter to Lydia & she, perhaps,
will give a more particular account of matters
she was disappointed at not hearing how
her mother was I believe - I dont think it will
be necessary for thee to write me any more
while I remain here as I expect to leave this 6th
day & to be in Ballitore 7th day so that I may
get home timely to let Wm. Gatchell go to the
National Meeting if he chooses - I am just
now returned from Anner Mills where we were
kindly entertained by them friendly women
Nancy Sends love to thee & says she wd. write
to thee only she is not qualified to write
on subjects of such consequence as ours
& her dear Sister Susy's, for surely she has
been applied for by James Moore I suppose
thou

thou knows him - Excuse me that I break
off. I expect to see thee soon, & besides I am
willing to leave a little room for our very
dear friend E. Grubb to add a few lines.
Joseph Garret & his wife are on their way
to Ducket's Grove - farewell
Wm. Leadbeater
Now as I think [underline]I[/underline] am qualified to write
on such subjects as these, I will in compliance
with our dear friends request, a [unclear][/unclear]
few lines, but thou must not think I [unclear][/unclear]
what is in this letter, for except that on [unclear][/unclear]
side & that which respects Nancy & - which
he read for me, I dont know a word in it 
I need not tell thee how I am & have
been gratified with this thy friend's company 
for being under no restraint I make
quite free with him & am greatly pleased &
flattered by his making so free with me,
notwithstanding he gives me frequent [unclear]rubs[/unclear]
such

such as pitying my future husband, calling
me an old maid &c - but I bear it all & we are
quite pleasant & comfortable together - I almost
pity thee for his long absence, but thou wilt
soon have him again & all will be made up.
I intend writing by him - farewell my dear
my paper just allows me to tell
thee that I am thy sincere frd
Eliza Grubb
