Dear Friend,
I enclose thee a
Post office order for 22/ for
the volumes & the postage.
I have read my half of
the first volume so far, &
find it very interesting.
My wife would be
glad

to know if Theodore [unclear]Sulid's[/unclear]
daughter is with you, for
she takes a great interest
in the family of her old &
much valued tutor.
In haste
Thy sincere friend
[underline]John Bright[/underline]
