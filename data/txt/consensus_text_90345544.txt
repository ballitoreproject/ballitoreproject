30th.. Thursday - Very wet morning
but we did not allow the rain to deter
us from going out and found the
covered shed very convenient to walk
about in. At twelve Ned went
for his bath and I awaited him
in this new kind of promenade -
About half an hour had elapsed
and thinking it high time [insertion]for him [/insertion]to
re-appear I ran down to see what he
was about -. I soon spied the
bath boy - "Is my brother there or
has he gone up to the house" said I
"Oh he's here Miss in the bath, would
you like to come in and see how
he's yoked up -"? then seeing I
hesitated he added by way of encouragement
"Oh there's no harm you may come
in he's all covered up, the ladies
often come in to see their friends
in the bath" So in I went and
there was Ned sure enough all covered
up, he did look so funny with
nothing but his head peering out -
