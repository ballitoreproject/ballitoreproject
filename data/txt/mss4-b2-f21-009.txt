Dear Friend/
as Thy Father was Writing home I thought I would Inclose a few Lines to Acquaint how I thought we got along
	From your Center we brought Two Extreams, the one a Vibrating motion moved more by a love for, than the Love of the Gospel; Zealous to be doing, Altho it ware[?] to drive a Lame and halting flock into Action before their Eyes are opened out of Sleep The other has both Bowels to feel shill to discern, & Judjments to divide, has been frequently favourd with Suitable food & a Command to set in due season before the People, But notwithstanding he has felt the Curse that follow those who ,, withold bread,, he cannot be prevaild upon to hand it forth whilst the Blessing is upon it for fear of being Calld a Son of the Pr^o^phets; Thus we have been Embarased between these Oposates from meeting to meeting, Sencibly feeling the Stagnation of Life, and the Service Wounded; We have been honnest (at Least some of us) and yet the Two Extreams, seeing Each other; avoid Each others faults; but neither amend their own; I have been much concernd for the service sake which has led me to Spake Plainly to both but in Particular Thy Father, as to the other its Lost labour to attemp moving him out of his old Trott, Thy Father has more than once Acknowledgd he has Sufferd for his unfaithfullness and yet persits in Leting slavish fears come over him again I have however still a hope that he will Return home a Preacher I,G gets Loose now and Then half a star and half the man above the stars I cant but wish he was Reduced a Little Lower and compelld to put off the Princely and put on Priests rayments he posesses the Root of the matter, But must be more staked to the foundation and Witness Loss before he becomes beautifull on the sides of the mountains A:B is a Man of Integrity sees Clearly but is dificant in faith is Redy to doubt Every thing unless he both sees & feels at the Same time as for Jamy & my Self we are as Usual Hobbleing along some times hits & some times missing the mark, if we Walkt more by faith and Less by Sight we would fare better Joseph learns in Silence and In Patience Posesses his own mind, Thus far Intiligence Extrordinary; my Love To Whole Self &c &c Thy Loving Thy Senceire friend.
