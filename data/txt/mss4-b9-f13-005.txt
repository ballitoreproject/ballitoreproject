Ballitore 29th of 1st month 1823.
My dear Sarah
The bonnet is perfect _ in every respect,
& more valued because thou altered it not because
thou saved me some money thereby but because
it is thy handy work - All the other things are
also just as I would wish them - I said I would
not trouble thee with commissions any more
but I find I must beg thee to get me a very
fine wery comb or a box one , & [unclear]a[/unclear] [underline]each [/underline] one also.
the one Eliza Maynor persuaded one to get in
the Arcade is of but little use it is to coarse
I have left Debs. - She is recovered but looks 
[deletion]but[/deletion] yellow - the bile being so much disturbed I 
suppose, however when she can go out I think that
will disappear - But, [insertion]to[/insertion] say something of myself.
We propose staying here until 2nd day after
the fifth day if Joseph Fisher's health will
permit James to delay - at present he is very
delicate & only able to sit in an easy chair
I did not think he was so ill until the last
home word thank "The Lord was not expected" Fairewell for
I may well leave thee after this fine story ever my dear
Sarah
Thy every affectionate sister
Lydia
The snow drops are just appearing - like remnants of the snow.
My mother's dear love to thee & begs thou wilt send her
next account _ this goes by Thomas Bewley Please pay
Eliza for the braid

letter I had from James - Hannah Dawsen will
be here tomorrow week - wishing to stay one week
with us before - entre nous I could excuse a
stranger's presence & it my last week. Joseph
Christy is to be here also I suppose, & who
else I know not excepting Sally Fisher & Jacob
Harvey & his sister - I hope Edward will not be
prevented - Oh! I wish for thee but I must learn
to stifle vein wishes before I have to sigh for all
I love here. - & I would be very much disappointed
if Edward were not here - at least I think so now
Offer him my love & my entreaties for his coming
I can scarcely say I would desire to remain one
day here after the marriage, - but that I know
how difficult it may be for me to visit this
"nook of earth" again, - for I think to all I am not
welcome - but being dearly so to some, compensates
for this - Elizth is extremely kind doing everything
for me - she has refused returning with us
& thus disappointed me greatly - for I would rather
have her than any one else - Betsy Shackleton

I hope will come but I cannot be sure as my
aunt is so delicate. -- George went to Limerick
to day via Dublin, - he bears his success oddly but
joyously - I have began my farewell visits - I took
tea last evening with M Davis & this with Lucy
Bewley - it feels sad enough to me - but sure
I have no cause to refuse because my hopes were
granted. - I hope thou art well & that my
commissions have not annoyed thee. - I am
obliged to Eliza for the braid - but I mean to
tell her so. - I am very sorry I cannot have her
here - All my pique has vanished & I feel more
as I used two years since
to [insertion]wards[/insertion] her than I have done this
some time. - I hope John will be here,
Elizabeth begs thou wilt send the basket that Richard
sent up last under hares, I believe, to Jane Cooper
at Carters Grafton Street, for she has something
to send here. - I charge thee not to forget. this,
as E is anxious thou should not.
Lord Aldborough is very ill almost dead & Dr Davis
& Dr Stone of Carlow are there continually - our man
John went to Belan with the Dr & brought us
