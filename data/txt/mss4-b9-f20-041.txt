My dear Elizth
I believe Mary meant
Tim McAvoy the Carrier as I
did not hear that Edw was in
town, What revolutions! Well
yesterday morning either 5th
morning Edw Kelly's niece Cathe
Duffy who lived at E Kellys since
her mother died, call'd on me
to know if I knew of a place for her
perhaps she would answer thee
if thou chose thou might ask her
aunt about her, her father is too
poor to support her, I thought her
a nice little girl & some time ago
the thought came into my head
that she wd do for a second child's
maid if I wanted one, but I do
not at present, I am now at the
Glen I rec'd thine last night & will
keep Biddy Neville in my eye, along

object! I think it looks as if
S Haughton's servant made a set
against her say when thou writes
next what time her quarter will
expire, but still say naught about
it to others as I do not know whether
Edw will let me change Ally Smith
improves in health but seems totally
unacquainted with the treatment
of children so much for servants,
this is delightful weather I enjoy
the country after a long [unclear]privation[/unclear] of it,
wilt thou soon see RSL if thou
should tell him to remember the
dried leaves in Stradbally hall
for a bed for me thou might get
a cheap cover for them from Deborah
of G B's calico I have a tick at
home, I am sorry we have
so bad a chance of seeing thee
in Dublin perhaps the meeting
would intice thee it would have
many inducements for thee
beside Mary Richardson, think
of it however but surely it is
too far off to [unclear]calculate[/unclear] upon
I am glad thou & Fanny go on[unclear][/unclear]
well together I hope you will [unclear][/unclear]
agree I wish thou had another or two
more, agreeable [deletion]people[/deletion] persons-
I burnt thy letter as soon as read
lest any one should see Harriets
offences, I hope Selina may get
acquainted with Charlotte Dawson
it would be a little variety
