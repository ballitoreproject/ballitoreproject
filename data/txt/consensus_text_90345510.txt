23 Saturday. Ned rode over to Ballyman
accompanied by Liddy and [deletion]I[/deletion] [insertion]me[/insertion] on foot -
It was a lovely mild day - and Phil's
place looked very nice and tidy,
being newly whitewashed and painted.
24 Sunday - Ned, Avy, Lid and I went
to meeting. There was another
letter from Margt and John dated
Frankfurt 8/20- where they had
[extra line]
safely arrived and were going
on to Wildbad. Charlie returned
with us.
25 Monday Papa and Mistress went to
town, [deletion]with[/deletion] Dick too - Lid and I
took a ride down to Bray.

better and looks so too. Showery -
27 Wednesday NP - xxxxxxxx.
28 Thursday - I went to town
to stay a few day thinking perhaps
Charlie might care a little for

indeed I dare say I [underline]flattered[/underline] myself
