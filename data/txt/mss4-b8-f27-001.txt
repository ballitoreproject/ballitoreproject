+ I believe Pat Kelly will take the basket
in his Pockets for you - there is another with two

[unclear][/unclear]n. I am sure you will [unclear]be angry[/unclear] In what I am
[unclear][/unclear] may say what you please to poor Tim 
[unclear][/unclear] hear that you beat your wife.
[unclear][/unclear] mplained to you too I suppose. It is well I did not
[unclear][/unclear]up, or she'd tell it of me, & have me hanged. O, [unclear]Jem[/unclear]
[unclear][/unclear] of a woman [unclear][/unclear]
[unclear]Wm[/unclear] what quietness will do with her. Poor Anstise's not a bad-
natured [unclear][/unclear] & she would hear reason, I am sure.
Tim. No [unclear][/unclear] she'll hear no reason. I came home, starved & tired & thought to
sit down [unclear][/unclear] my supper - but not a potatoe was washed - the fire was out
the door was just [unclear][/unclear]ashed, & no body within. I strove to rake out a coal of fire
& was washing the potatoes myself when in come [unclear]Auntis[/unclear] laughing & tittering with
Peggy Donoghoe, & she never said Tim I am sorry for serving you this way, or took
the potatoes from me to put on, but [unclear]turned[/unclear] about, as if she [deletion]was[/deletion] [insertion]right to be[/insertion] angry & not I
I said nothing till Peggy went & then I told her [unclear][/unclear] [unclear]trust she warn her[/unclear]
[unclear]high home[/unclear] - & it [unclear]dris Lydia[/unclear] but [unclear][/unclear], but she aggravated me so that I beat her -
sure enough.
Jem. Well Tim, it is a woman's duty to have her [unclear][/unclear] her [unclear][/unclear]
hand, let him come home in a good human or a [unclear][/unclear] & it is a man's duty to, [unclear]runndn[/unclear]
[unclear][/unclear] his wife & make allowances for her if she [unclear][/unclear] ways do as he'd have her
& to be pleasant when he comes home, & if he is [unclear]pleasant[/unclear] the [unclear]pleasures[/unclear]
they will long be the time of seeing one another again. Indeed I have no
right to [unclear]lath her[/unclear] often I was cross to [unclear]hon[/unclear] [unclear]there[/unclear] when I came home after spending
most of my week's hire at the Ale house - for I was so angry at myself for spending it
so badly that I used to come home in a wicked humour indeed - & sure I would
have been worse but that she was so quiet - for tho' I'd see her wiping her eyes
with her apron, not a cross word would she say. But I hope that is over now.
Tim. O indeed, Jem, you have no excuse to behave bad to [unclear]Ane[/unclear]. she is no
gossiper, no [unclear]coller[/unclear] no lazy bones, no tea drinker.
Jem. Why did you give [unclear]Anitis[/unclear] so much of her way at first, & promise her
tea, when you knew in your heart you could not afford it
Tim. Aye Tim, there I was wrong, & indeed I was wrong to marry till I had something
to the [unclear][/unclear] especially when I had such bad help.
Jem. O Tim, never got into the way he [unclear]being[/unclear] sorry that you married
Kelfler theaters that will be
sent when there is room - 

that once done is done for life, but strive to live together comfortably & nothing [unclear]makes[/unclear] [deletion][/deletion]
poor people more comfortable than content & goodhumour. You are a man & should have
more sense - when you are in a goodhumour together then draw down these little [unclear]things[/unclear]
& talk them over quietly
Tim. Ah, Jem when we are pleasant I am so loth to speak - of any thing that might
unsettle us, tho' I know that is the best time for such discourse, for I love Anstes, & she
loves me, & I wonder we don't agree better.
Jem. Well, make a resolution never to be both angry at the same time, & then you
will agree better. I give you my word for it.
