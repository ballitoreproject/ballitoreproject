 [unclear]Settle[/unclear]29 of the 9th 1776
From a desire of being more intimately
acquainted with my dear Mary Shackleton, am I willing
to expose my many deficienc[insertion]i[/insertion]es for I should be sorry that an
acquaintance, that I took some pains to attain, should
be lost from any fault on my part; and writing is now
our only resourse, as a substitute for an absence that
can't be avoided, is an inducement for me to propose a
corrispondance, which I flatter myself thou will have no
objections too, however nothing shall be omited that is in my
power to render such a proposal agreeable, yet at the same
time, I am sensible thou will have many allowances to
make, but shall trust to thy candor in overlooking every
defect, and could wish in return thou would place the like
confidence in me.
It is with particular satisfaction I reflect
on the few happy days I spent at Ballitore, and your civility
to me demands my sincerest acknowledgements, but as it seems

at present totally impossible to discharge the great debt of
obligation that was confered on DB whilst an inhabitant at
your hospitable mansion, I can only endeavour to convince
you of my sensibility ofit, and the pleasure it would give
me to have it in my power to make an adequate return,
which I hope will be the case, when my dear friends are
so obliging has to pay us a visit, and surely you will never
come into En[insertion]g[/insertion]land without spending part of your time at
Settle, it is what we shall expect, and [underline]I think[/underline] not without
some claim.
My dear Brother & Sister left us, last
fifth day, they made a much longer stay here, then they
once intended, a favour they would not have confered on us
if they [insertion]could[/insertion] have avoided it, my Brother was very much engaged
with packing, that he had scarse one hour to spare to be
with his friends, they purposed arriving at Tottenham to
night, and expected to meet with a Cargo of letters from
Ballitore. You will without doubt, find a very great
want of my Sister, whose agreeable company would be a great
addition to your felicity. Oh! my dear Mary how painful
it is, to part with those we love, nothing but hope that
balm of human life, could support us under it but does not
the pleasure of meeting overbalance the pang of separation

and one cannot be enjoyed, without experiencing the other.
to Jane, and inform them that the Yearly meeting
Please to give my kind love to thy cousin Fullers, but perticularly
is to be held at Herkby Steven, and if they attend it, I shall
expect to be favored with their company at Settle, or I shall
be ready to conclude, it is for want of invitation [underline]if not inclination.[/underline]
My Brother joins me in
dear love, to all your family, whose kindness I trust, we
shall ever remember, yea & with gratitude too.
I shall conclude with desiring, if the proposal meet with
thy approbation to hear from thee, when leisure & inclination
suits, and I hope thou will remember, this is only for
thy own perusal, therefore don't expose the many [unclear]impertions[/unclear]
of thy Affectionate, & obliged friend.
Pim desires his love, also [deletion][/deletion] my mother, though personally
una[insertion]c[/insertion]quainted with a many of you.
