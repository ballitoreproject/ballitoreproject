sailed for Germany &c: but behold, after all,
James Harford is not gone, apprehending, I suppose,
that he has got a release. 23d.. after a fatiguing
day, of walking in wet, & having six sittings,
we walked two miles home almost in the
dark & went weary to bed. 24th.. meeting-day, at wch..
Sally Darby & S: Appleby were, took a ride over
from Bath to see WS, returned in the evening. Took
four families after meeting, five sittings. 25th.. Seven
sittings. 26th.. went to James Harford's to breakfast, & sat
in his family after, which was rather a trying one to
me from bodily indisposition, so my dear S:Talbot, & S:T
left me behind & set about their daily employ, I staid
here, & was kindly nursed till after tea, & then came
home to John Lury's- the Sarah's sat with five families
after they left me. 27th.. meeting day wherein Wm.
Savery preach'd & pray'd. We dined together with
Anne Tilladams. Took three families in the evening.
28th.. Had but three sittings, it not being convenient
to more to receive us. 29th.. First-day. After first-meeting,
in which Wm.. Savery was the only speaker, [underline]we[/underline]
sat with two families, & at six went to a very
large publick meeting indeed, notice being given
to others, at Wm..'s request:- he laboured faithfully
amongst them, I wish it may prove effectually.
R:Fowler with them.!
