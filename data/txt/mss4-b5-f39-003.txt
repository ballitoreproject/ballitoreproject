full of repetitions that I woud not
send it - were it not that at this moment
I cannot get leave to write in others
Excuse its defects - The fact is
I sit here at the receipt of custom and
since I began this letter yesterday morning
have been interrupted at least ten times -
with visitors - and have been obliged to
see two or three letters - and help [unclear][/unclear]
dozen notes also - so that
in fact I have wrote the same
thing over and over again -
Once more am I interrupted - adieu
My Dr. Madam
With Cordial Esteem -
Your friend
April the 18 ... 1822
