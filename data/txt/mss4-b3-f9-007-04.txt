From the same to the same

Ballitore: 13/3 month 1776

Dear Cousin,

	We are much obliged as well as pleased by thy early intelligence of thy dear wifes safe delivery, & the favourable prospect respecting her ++ Ye have had your trials with bodily infirmities: may your minds be preserved healthy, having an appetite for food, & fed in due season.
	Sam & Peggy made their appearance at our meetings of discipline at Carlow 6th instant, it seemed to me a solemn season, & I have been thankful that in a matter of so great importance, I have been favoured so repeatedly to believe that the thing is right, & in the ordering of best Wisdom. Such condescension in Divine Goodness, not only to visit & measurably preserved ourselves in the way of life & salvation, but to extend the same blessing to our offspring, & dispose of them according to his good pleasure, is indeed a capital favour from a munificent hand. Such a profusion of favours is worthy of the great & liberal Donor [?], who matters ^scatters^ his mercies among the families of his people, & calls for returns of duty & affection & filial fear & obedience +++

	Thine affectionately
		Richard Shackleton
