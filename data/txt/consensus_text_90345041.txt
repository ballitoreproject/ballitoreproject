After dinner I went
to Bushfield Avenue.
I could scarcely believe
I was going, till
I was safely seated in
the omnibus, having
waited for it for a full
quarter of an hour I
think, not very pleasant
considering the
rain and muddy
streets. However on getting
out of the omnibus
I was glad to find it
was not raining, [deletion]so[/deletion]
Mr Nannie I found busy
dusting books, but altho'
she scarcely expected
me, I think she was
glad to see me. if not
