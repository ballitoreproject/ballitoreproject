Clonmel 11th month 3d 1788

My dear Uncle

	I have the satisfaction of being the messenger of good tidings to thee respecting our beloved sister Margaret  She has been in ^a^ poor low depressed way for some time back in prospect of the unavoidable trial before ^her^ & for this two weeks has been subject to many alarms  last night before we went to bed there seemed more certainty in her feelings than heretofore  about twelve she grew worse, at two called up M Bleach, at seven Aunt Sparrow & the Doctor & about half after nine was safely delivered of a very lovely, stout boy without having suffered much more than usual upon such occasions, except a sore travail of mind which continued to the last  but her joy is now full & the more so as it has succeeded a long night of [word crossed out] sorrow
She is very finely today  I never saw any one so strong & lively in her situation  her honest countenance again smiles unaffectedly & her grateful heart flows (I do beleive [sic]) with unfeigned thankfulness to the great giver of every good & perfect gift, who has thus far mercifully preserved ^her^ through many (peradventure more than six) troubles & I do beleive [sic] having loved her, will love her to the end  she desires her dear love to thee, to Aunt & every other branch of your & our family as does bro. Samuel who knowing of my writing desires to be excused  Sister would be glad that her kind friend A. Shannon may be informed of this comfortable event if convenient as she particularly desired it  were the circumstance less important to thee than it is, thy liberal mind would promote thy communicating the knowledge ^of^ it to my dear R.G. (to whom I would now write if as fit for the employ as at other times, but I hope to do it by tomorrow post, when it may be in my power to give a further account of sister) also to brother Thomas, Mary Dudley & many of our dear friends in Dublin (though not all of Dublin) who have been affectionately concerned about her
	Our family ^is^ in general favoured with health  my dear sister Elizabeth has a sore throat which prevented her coming over here today & I having been at home but a few minutes 
have not entered much into the state of her case; but I know she would not complain without occasion  I wrote to my husband by brother Thomas & mentioned an account we received of our dear aged Grandmothers decease which has sensibly touched our beloved sisters affectionate feelings  I hear today that poor A. Broadhead is in trouble having ^being^ by a letter from home informed of her sisters removal, concerning whose illness she had tidings when Cousin Abraham was here  so that affliction seems creeping about our habitation, where I trust there are divers susceptible hearts which may be bettered by the present & future entrances of this purifying visitant  yet we are those who can feelingly say that no chastisement is for the present ^joyous^ but rather greivious [sic]: to rejoice in tribulation is a superior attainment, probably not to [sic] arrived at, till the other has done its office  My heart however is favoured with gratitude to the great preserver of men for this renewed instance of ihs goodness & addition to our family & shall we receive these good things at the divine hand & not receive evil?
	I am in hope of receiving letters from thee & thine for America as I am making up a packet for my beloved R. Jones & desired my husband to inform you, tis likely the vessel will sail from Waterford in a few days  there is also one going from Limerick to New York, a friend master; so that any letters sent to Joseph [?] Hervey, will be carefully forwarded, but I think you had better let our communications be in company 
	Please to ^tell^ my husband that last 7th day I had a letter from Josiah [?] Beale informing that a vessel is to sail soon for Bordeaux by which he intended to send the books ^&^ of which he wanted a list & to be told what other things to inclose  I wrote him by return of post, also inclosed a letter for Louis, but my husband having the list with him (as I suppose) it could not be sent, which is not of much consequence, but if any thing is to be wrote to Josiah [?] upon this occasion, probably a letter sent immediately from Dublin may be timely  My dear love is feelingly alive to many of my beloved friends now convened on truths account in the great city, particularly to every branch of thy family, my dear countryman M. Johnson whose sheaves I hope are gathering together to the praise of the good Husbandman  salute also my dear companion M Dudley  she will I hope be strengthened every way by this excursion, her three little girls spent last 7th day with us & I beleive [sic] her flock is well  I remember I am ^in^ thy debt for a valueable & much valued letter or letters of no very late date  accept this rough but sincere salutation not as a ^full &^ worthy acknowledgement of thy favours, but in the line of family duties, the right performance whereof carries with it its own reward  I am thy truly affectionate S. R. Grubb
