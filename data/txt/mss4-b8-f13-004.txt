Waterford 2d of 9th Month 1827 -
My Dear Elizabeth
I have just casually heard
of thy fresh bereavment, but neither when
or how it occurred yet seem disposed
to offer the salutation of affectionate Sympathy,
in which my mother cordially unites
tho fully aware that the communication of such
feelings, can avail but little, under the pressure
of a sorrow like this - a reiterated wound,
ere the former was healed which thy filial
affection so keenly felt, even to anguish -
nevertheless a proof of remembrance from an
absent friend in the hour of deep Conflict
may yeeld some consolation, especially if it
points to the unfailing source of sure support
with which beloved Elizabeth my mother is
persuaded thou art not unacquainted, but
has experimentaly known, in seasons of bitterest
grief that there is no true comfort but in

the Lord alone who does not willingly afflict
his creatures, tho his dispensations are often
long beyond finite comprehension yet they are ordered
in unerring wis-dom and for a great & gracious
purpose [deletion]which[/deletion] she trusts, thou will be enabled
encreasingly to confide, and commit thy ways
to him, & so rejoicingly experience all things to
work together for good; as we are assured will be
the case [insertion]with[/insertion] [deletion]to[/deletion] those who love God - She also
covets for thy dear brother whom she has
long followed with secret but strong solicitude
that he may build on the same foundation
even that whereon the prophets [insertion]& apostles[/insertion] were built
and on which his honourable predecessors
were likewise established esteeming the
reproach of Christ greater riches than
the treasures of Egypt - for him
& others of their descendents she cannot
but earnestly desire, the same wise choice
that they also may become of the excellent
of the earth - Accept our dear

love, offer it to thy aunts [insertion]& cousn Elizabeth[/insertion] - excuse these
hasty lines penned nearly in the dark
& believe me thy attached friend
