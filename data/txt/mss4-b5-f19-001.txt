Dublin, 1 Mo.- 1700
Dear Friend
We were very much obliged to thee
for being so kind as to leave that receipt, which
I immediately tried. I have continued it about three
weeks (constantly, according to direction) at present
I do not think that I am much better my right
ear is not much affected, but my left is so [unclear]ex [/unclear]
sore that I can scarce bear it to be touched,
-ded at times with violent stitches; it aches continually
& this morning my left jaw has begun to swell
I am sorry to trouble thee with this account, but I
wish'd to know from thee how long I am to continue it
which I shall do, till I hear from thee: & if I am not too
troublesome I should esteem it a great favour, if thou

could send me a few of thy beautiful & much admired poems.
Be pleased to give our dear love to all your Family in particular
to thyself. My Father & Mother join me in dear love to
thee - from thy affectionate Friend.
Mary Birkett. -

This was handed me yesterday by Sarah Besket, who informed
me of the content, and upon considering it, I think it
but to send it by port, as she intends, continuing the [unclear][/unclear] of the
[unclear][/unclear] untill she hears from thee, she represented it having a severe
effect and I thought it quite unfit to wait private conveyance
I have not read the [unclear][/unclear] - Johnny is just return'd from Mtmelick
Susanna Abbot much better I suppose you heard of her being in a dangerous
way, three doctors attending, do let me hear from thee soon M Bewley
