Lisburn 9th Mo: 7th 1785 -
Dear Molly Shackleton
Thine from Moat met me here, and raised that Symthy
which becomes fellow pilgrims with each other in their varied exercises - but
as we dont sorrow without Hope - let us be moderate - let us be resigned - Yea
Let us be thankful in every Dispensation of Divine Providence. "Behold he taketh
away, who can hinder him? or who may say unto him what dost thou?" Tell
the dear Orphans (& take A: T. in) that I love them, I feel for them, and pray that
the awful Visitation may be sanctified to each of them, in engaging their Love &
Obedience [insertion]to,[/insertion] and fixing their Trust & Reliance on the everlasting Father, who will
abide with them for ever. Thou asks my excuse for the obligation thou
has conferred - I can hardly excuse the apology - so, in future [insertion]remember[/insertion] [deletion][/deletion]
[deletion][/deletion]
[deletion][/deletion] I shall always be pleas'd with thy thoughts on
Paper - The scene was doubtless humbling, but when it comes to our turn
it will be more awfully so! - yet even then! if we have as good Stewards been
improving the divine Talent, and faithful to the measure of Grace received, we
may with confidence in the Lord's mercy be enabled to render our accts with Joy -
which I am inclined to believe the innocent Man, yr beloved Relative did -
Tell my dear Countrywoman, I almost persuade myself to believe
that after the Q M at Ballinderry, my dear Compn. S. G & self shall come
pretty directly to Dublin - and perhaps her beloved G. D. may come with us &
make her a Visit at pleasant Ballitore while Z. D goes to the meetings in the
North - but I may be mistaken - However that may be, I shall be pleased
if some of you will make up my Things which I left at yr House in a parcel,
& send them by a safe conveyance to Dublin, directed to J. Williams's Care; as
I shall have occasion for them - and the sooner they are sent the better, for we
may not stay long in that city -
I am glad dear Lydia is favoured to get thro' her difficulty - my
Dear Love is to her. & Abm. also G's& Sally's to them, & they unite me in the Salutation
to the afflicted Young women. To thy worthy Parents, to dear Sally, & the two women
frds. in yr House - and besure to S. D. - I am in haste thy obliged & loving frd.
R Jones
I hope thou'l excuse this rough scrap, as Company coming in prevents my copying it. indeed I think
it needs some apology - [deletion]as[/deletion] it looks rather shabby - but as I'm not us'd to double Labour, submit it

G. D with his Love to his dear wife desires she may understand that his Return
to Ballitore so soon as R. J. mentions being quite an Uncertainty, she must not
lay in Provision for Disappointment, but according to her ancient Custom expect
nothing about him till she sees him coming up street or over the Bridge -
