Clonmel 22 of 11 month 1784

My dear Father,
	
	I received thy kind letter by Jemmy Daniel, & am often wishing for a satisfactory release from care to address thee, sometimes interrupted by company, sometimes by attention to Household affairs, & sometimes by indisposition of the children, Aby & Richard have both had feverish illness, I suppose colds, but are both thro favour recovered: we are throng [?] washing to day, which has put me late in settling to pay this just debt. It affords satisfaction (altho, not a sharer in it) to find the late solemnity in Dublin was favoured with the ownings of Divine regard, which is indeed lengthened our wonderfully to a backsliding, revolting people, saying Spare thy People &c. It is pleasant to hear of Dear Edward Hatton & Jo Nicholson, I wish the latter may grow from strength to strength, & fully answer the design of the great former upon him, & not become, like many dwarfs amongst us, fainting in the time of inward suffering ready to look back towards Sodom: or ready to take our flight in the Winter, as well as ^on^ the Sabbath day, it seems as if many have fallen here, when the dew is withheld, not able to abide in patience this day of trial, & tribulation, which might have been a day of refinement.
	My Husband did not think it best for him to leave home at the time of the meeting, & I seemed (upon looking at it, & weighing it as well as I could) most easy to abide at home, not having a Person suitable to leave the family in charge with, & the journey so long, & no Womens [sic] meeting to attend, for as dear Jemmy Abell says of himself, I have not attained to that Religious growth to make my going of any consequence except to myself: to be sure I would, (& we should) like to be where Good was striving, as our inward Man stands in great need of every assistance to oppose our three great Enemys [sic] The World, the flesh, & the Devil. but [sic] if we humbly seek help at home we shall find it I believe: excuse me for running on so free on the subject, but my thoughts & mind are free when communing with my dear Father, I may say I feel no straitness, the young Woman (Debby Coakley) is come, & I believe will be of use to me, & a suitable person to fill the place I wanted her in. I long to hear how poor Sallys neck is, I really am of opinion you are too ready to draw-teeth there, I think I have found considerable service from washing my jaws, neck & [seal] morning in cold water, & rubbing them well after [seal] cloth, I seldom or ever have the tooth-ache since I pursued this remedy regularly, & my teeth are still decaying. Poor Anna Taverner to loose [sic] her speech, does this loss continue? please [sic] give her my dear love, & also to the family where she is. I heard of Robert Valentines intention of marriage, which surprised us. I am obliged to thee for the verses. I am concerned my sister Chandlees child is not well yet, I wonder does her leg pain her, or can she walk, I would be obliged to thee for particular information respecting the dear Baby, & what way she is in, & whether she gets her health well or otherwise. Brother Robert does not say any thing to us what he means to do, as to a settlement. I do not think he will disturb Brother Thomas suddenly, Sister Sally is still following her Mill business & I not [sic] find she has formed any new plan, or means to change her place of residence: my Mother continues much as usual, rather better I think, she goes very often to Twomile bridge, her Girl seems to answer well, & continues very quiet obliging & agreeable to me, she is a handy, diligent Servant. I wish she may hold out. Poor, dear John Pembertons trial with his hand gives me concern, M: Dudley had a long, encouraging epistle from W: Mathews [sic] lately dated Cockermouth, M: D: is much as usual, desires her dear love, she has got her Husband home home [sic] [seal]. Poor Betsy Pim thou says poorly. I [seal] inclosed enclosed any letter to your Member since the [seal] about franks. I have no frank now to cover this. Anne got me to write a letter of news to her Aunt Molly, which tarrys [sic] to save charges. Our dear love attends you all, Mother in particular & am thy dutiful & affectionate Margaret Grubb
