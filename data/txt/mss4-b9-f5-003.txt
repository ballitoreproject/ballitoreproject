Limerick 14 March 1834
Dear Edward. -
We got here safe & sound
at 10' o'clock & found the child much
better. - James had written a note by
the Day Coach to ease Lyddy's mind, which
I assure you was worth a pound note, at
least, for she was extremely dull all the
way & had made up her mind for the
worst, on receipt of the Note she got quite
lively & we were quite gay the rest of
the way, we got it about 12 or 14 miles fm.
Limerick. -
The Doctor speaks cheeringly to day, gives
hopes, as the symptoms are quite favourable.
the disease was tendency to water on the

Brain, he is blistered on the back of
the neck &c. &c. & is very lively to day -
The Doctor is exceedingly attentive has staid
up these 2 or 3 nights with him, indeed all
their friends are very kind in assisting -
I expect to return a [unclear]per [/unclear]mail this evening. -
We had a desperate seven nights, not one
of our drivers escaped a wetting. -
Indeed James thought yesterday morning
that Lyd would not see him alive, he, [insertion]James[/insertion] seems
a good deal cut up in anxiety & watching
Lyd, desires he love to you all, if she have
time at all she will write a few lines

My dearest Sarah -
My poor little Lamb is
something better - a dawning of
hope is permitted, but great care
& caution are necessary - he was
glad to see me. - We got on wonderfully
well - & it
is some relief to
be near the sufferer.
They had no hope
yesterday. -
The Dr. says it was
fullness of the blood in the head & great
danger of water on the brain. I am
almost afraid to hope. - Thou shalt
hear again tomorrow or next day -
Mary bore the journey very well
With dear love to Edward I am
thy afftc L.J F.
