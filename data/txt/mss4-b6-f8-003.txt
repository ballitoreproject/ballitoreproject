Ballitore: 18th of 12th month 1808
Elizabeths birth day. 17
My dear Athenian,
I have waited to be able to acknowledge properly the receipt of
thy intelligent, agreeable, affectionate letter, but I find I cannot do it to
satisfaction, yet do it I must for selfish, as well as friendly reasons. Ebenezer
is sounding Marriots poems in my ear, when he is not sporting a
jest, & how well that comports with literary converse thou may guess.
I am rejoiced that your beloved little Edmund has thrown off his
indisposition & promises to be a scholar - [underline]that[/underline] I hope he will be - but tho'
he may have a musical ear I hope he will not practise, for I think [underline]that[/underline]
does not match the manly character.
Before I go any far let me continue my dear Agnes's history, perhaps
thou heard that her dear engaging mother is no more. The cancer
which her daughter on her [insertion]first[/insertion] visit after her marriage discovered, continued to
baffle the [deletion][/deletion] effort of medicine, & after having endured much, with
patience proportioned to her trials, she died the 19th of 10th mo:. The
agitation her daughter suffered on her mother's account combined with
her [deletion][/deletion] situation, seemed to endanger her own life several times. Her
affectionate husband concealed from her the death of her mother, she
was so very ill at the time, & her brother & I, & her other friends have
suffered some anxiety since on her account, but yesterday brought the
account of our dear Agnes having become mother to a fine little girl
the 24th Ult: the Capt: postponed writing till he could announce her
complete recovery. I was flattered by the favourable mention of my
book in the Belfast magazine, but the severe attack on my friend included
in it was not very grateful to my feelings. I sent a few lines to
the Editors perhaps thou may see them. My illness was tedious & trying, tho'

I suppose not dangerous - it might, however have become so, but for the
kind of attention of a gentleman, with whom I had just become acquainted
Wm. LeFanu was bred to the Law. I believe he has resigned the profession, he
has however studied medicine in his chamber, not as a profession, but to be
useful to the Poor. His uncle is Rector of Dunlavin, & came to live at Ballilea
near Ballinure last summer - this young man was with him, & hearing
of his great medical skill, Sister Sally brought him to see me & I believe
his treatment was very judicious. A Dr: would have been called in at his
desire, but I grew so much better it seemed needless. Certainly our acquaintance
increased thenceforward, my kind Dr. borrowed books from me amongst
others P Wakefield's Juvenile Anecdotes, which he liked so well that I shewed
him a little collection of similar anecdotes which I wrote myself - these
met with his approbation so fully that he encouraged me strongly to publish
a little volume, & wrote an Introduction for me. I have now nearly completed
the manuscript. I mean to print on my own account, & my friend
desires me to enquire whether some copies could not be disposed of in Belfast
& other towns. The book will be small I expect, & a small price, perhaps
about 2/2 or less. Wilt thou enquire whether they could be disposed [insertion]of[/insertion] & how
many & let me know soon? He enquires will I put my name. I feel disposed
to do so. I should tell thee that this family are gone to Dublin for
the winter. Finding they were near losing their benevolent Physician, the
Poor flocked to him in such abundance, that some said there were four
score with him, & five carloads of [underline]decayed people[/underline] were on the way
another said the crowd was equal to the Christmas market, & one
asserted [insertion]that[/insertion] a Fair could not be missed out of it. This is not the work
I desired thee to speak to the Bookseller about. I had Sophia in view,
also a Poem in blank verse, by myself, called Goodnature, of above
600 lines. - I am to send it to W LeFanu for his opinion & advice, &
I intend then per first opportunity to send it for thine. It should go first to
thee if the convenience of sending to each of you was equal. I had like to
forget to desire thee to send me an order of R: & G: Bell for the cash thou

mentions 5 guineas, & I am much obliged to thee for thy kind assistance.
Thou speaks of Clarkson's work on the abolition. I have not yet seen it. My
friend Lefanu writes thus of it to me. "I have got Clarkson on the abolition - a
"most delightful Book - a complete antidote to Malthus's * flinty reveries - but
"what a people are the English - how are their hearts steeled by commerce -
"it was above twenty years before a hole could be drilled through them, for
"the admission of mercy, & even then its diameter was so narrow, that a most
"scanty stream made its way - the Negroes are still slaves, & their children
"to all generations in the Islands - and the barbarous code of laws
"by which they are governed, is unrepealed - this is an indelible stain.
"for the immortal honour of the Society of Friends, they were the first
"to interfere for the poor Africans - indeed their conduct & final success is
"a living comment on the Christian revelation, & its inestimable morality
"- it proves that the more pertinaciously we adhere to its precepts,
"the more happy we become ourselves, & the more useful to our fellow
"creatures."
I like the Belfast Magazine very well, for my part, & hope it
will stand when our heads are laid low. I am confident thy Tour to the
Causeway is well worthy a place in it, do insert it, & then I shall possess it. I
wish it could be accompanied by the elegant drawing Capt: Ramage made
of this stupendous sport of Nature. The children unite with Wm. & me, Mary
& Anne in dear love to you both. Sally & Betsy are in Carlow, intend staying
over the meeting. This day week John Haughton & Mary Doyle were married, &
are now cozily settled at [unclear]Rheban[/unclear] I suppose. Ellen Haughton has got delicate
health, I hear she is better. She appears to be very comfortable. Anne & Sally
& the three youngest children are at home. My aunt Wilson rejoices in her
daughter's settlement I believe. Dear, good woman, with all her singularities!
How dost like Deborah's verse in last Belfast Mag? Thou may be sure her
heroicks are not lessened by this honour. Do ask the Printer how much
he thinks the expense of printing such a little book as I mentioned will be.
I sent thee my old letter by Jonathan Pike I believe. I hope thou got it safe
as thou values it so much
[insertion]* Malthus on Population[/insertion]

I know thou will write soon now, because it will serve me. Wm. is of the
mind that a peace will be made. So be it! These are disastrous times. I
strive not to dwell on the subject. I would that we could live so as not to fear
what man can do unto us! About two months ago, a valuable young man,
one of Wm.'s drivers, whom he had since he began business, was shot by robbers
between this & Carlow. Two men were in the carriage with him, another driving
who when he saw the ruffians was for hurrying on, but poor Owen Daly, ever
careful of his horses, would not let him hurry them. They attacked the chaise,
& made one of the men & Owen alight, attacked the other, poor Owen was strong, he
ran behind the robber to seize his gun, he turned & shot him dead - they then
beat the other till they thought they had killed him 'tis supposed. Then they went
away, not having robbed them I think, & Wm. saw his man brought home to the
Farm a bloody corpse. He was greatly shocked thou may be sure. Thy kind
father raised a little sum of money, by subscription for the widow. It is most
remarkable that her name was Dothy, her husband's Owen, & that she lived
with Dothy Finn when her husband [insertion]Owen[/insertion] was murdered. Jane Darcy died lately
at Nelly Hudson's - she grew very childish - had been for years declining in
mind & body. Molly Hudson stirs about, & seems in usual health, though
failing in memory &c - no wonder for she is 84 years of age. Our little Hannah
White & young Thos. Wm. Drake thrive like beautiful flowers, so does thy young
brother.
Dearly farewell
