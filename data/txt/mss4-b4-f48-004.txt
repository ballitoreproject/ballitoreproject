29/3 mo: 1806 It is now near a week since my dear Deby left us. That
morning I received a letter from Agnes, I wished thee to have seen it, & would I believe
have sent it, but concluded from the look of the morning that you would not
go. This letter informed me she was to return with Mary Farmer & to be here [unclear]3d..[/unclear] day.
I wrote to her that night engaging her to dine here with her Brother, who was to go with
Wm.. about buying timber. It was pretty early in the day (for they lodged at Maria Davis)
when accidentally looking towards the window. I saw my sweet One alighting at Abby
Widdows corner. This was such joy to one, for I dreaded a [underline] tustle[/underline] with Mary Farmer!
With I got her, & an appearance that she would stay that night & till next afternoon, &
then "my heart was as light as a feather all day." After a while she expressed her expectation
of seeing thee, I told her thou wert gone. "Gone!" She repeated & the tears fell from her
eyes faster than she could wipe them away. She blushed, & said, "I am very silly - but
"sometimes one's spirits are weak." I did not immediately give her thy note. She rose while
reading it, & turned to the window, & at length left the room. O my dear Betsy, thou

had I grow too romantick let me say, we had her company till next afternoon. John was
kind enough to resign her - he was rejoiced at meeting her, tho' he did not kiss her. [underline] Wm.. did[/underline]
While we were at dinner, Sally Watson & her Mule arrived - her Mule was put into the house
where our beautiful little heifer calf was, & soon did its business. It died next morning, much
regretted but we would not let dear Sally know any thing about it, & thought it happy none
of the children went near the vicious, little brute. This is a digression. I left our valuable
friend, got a car on which Agnes' trunks, John Ringwood & Richd.. were placed, & which we
send on before us, with orders to unload, return & meet me to take me home. We went to Roakefield,
stream & then we proceeded till we met the car, but no Richard - he staid with the
Turkies, so we mounted & soon arrived at Irishtown, where all, even the Cat, rejoiced at
seeing their elegant Mistress again. Tea was got, & before we finished John returned from
the Fair . We were cozy to a wish - Agnes escorted me as far as Charly Corfields' I believe,
& my eye perused her graceful form till I could see it no more. I do expect thou will
have a letter from her. I will not apologise for devoting this first page to her. Nor do I feel
much self reproach for setting thee an example of such unrestrained attachment, perhaps
I right to feel it - but when the object is so good, is it not allowable to see "Virtue in
"the proper shape how lovely." And if she leaves us my fault will have a punishment
at least severe enough. A letter from Edinburgh informs them that Mathew has [unclear]quit[/unclear]
the regiment, & has obtained what was the object of his going to Indies, a situation in the Company's service. The act (she writes
me) caused her strong & contending emotions she adds "[insertion]Oh[/insertion] What can compensate to us for this loss of his society, or to him for the loss
"of ours" His Parents in good health, & the prospect of their leaving Scotland a little revived.

though perhaps not sensible of it yet. Thy letter to thy Mother greatly delighted us, & the
to be liable to take cold. I hope dear George is partaking of the good effects of bathing
should not have this advantage, it would strengthen against winter & cause thee not
complaint, & would urge thy bathing. Indeed I think it would be a great pity thou
me, save the account of thy tooth-ache. Now I believe this to be a rheumatick

letter, worthy of the press. Apropos. Thou knows I suppose that Ben & Jane were here, & that
they lodged at the Cottage, that Ben was poorly & dull, yet he brightened before he left us.
he bought Sophia, but by mutual blunder has taken it on with him. All he could learn
was that the female critick pronounced it to be very well done - which I think is good
encouragement. When I get it I intend carefully reading it again, & if any thing occurs
to [deletion]be[/deletion] by way of revisal, note it down for thy inspection. I shall be pleased to hear of
your sitting down with Wm. & Fanny in their little meeting, because I believe you will
not find it unprofitable. They have honest hearts I believe, tho sometimes Wm. has not
proved much clearness of head. Don't forget to ask to see his journal, when your
acquaintance improves. I expect thou will rival me in the good graces of that
household where once I had the honour to be highly esteemed.
4/4 mo:
5th The above 2 letters & 1/2 wud [unclear]wird[/unclear]were all I had time to write last night after I
could settle to it. Yesterday being [underline]good Friday[/underline] Wm. & I, Mary S: & Eliz: & Richard L.
spent it to our hearts content. We set out about 12, & walked to Irishtown, where the
cordial reception we met would have amply compensated fatigue, if we had felt any
which I do not think we did. We left it just after tea. John & Agnes accompanied us
all walking (though we met the car nearer) to a good piece this side Ponur's Grove.
Between dinner & tea we walked in the fields, that is Wm. & John, Agnes & I. The
girls chose to stay in the warm parlour, & Richard disported with the Turkies &
Micky. Agnes enquired most affectionately for thee. I am still stronger of the mercy
that thou will hear soon from her - her friendship is no small acquisition. When I
was thy age of what infinite value should I have found such a friend! So pure a
heart, such correct judgment, such clearness of perception, such prudence of conduct
such delicacy of taste, such liveliness of imagination, such knowledge of the world
such delicacy of taste, such liveliness of imagination, such knowledge of the world
without imbibing any of its fault, such kindness, such sympathy, in one word such
unaffected goodnature, & this perfect figure clothed in the most graceful drapery
which simplicity & humility can bestow. If my "tongue grows wanton in her praise"

it is to thee who admires her as much, loves her half as much as I do but does
not, cannot know her as well, & I indulge myself as usual [deletion]to[/deletion] in thus making
amends to myself for the restraint I am obliged to use to others, lest I be looked upon as
extravagant. I am quite pleased at the exchange of thy domesticks. I have known
Bep Lennon from a child, & always liked her, & would have applied for her as a
servant had I thought my place suitable for her, till now when I looked upon her as engaged
to Lydia, at least in mind. I think thou will be much easier with her, &
I was fearful of thy being overdone for thy frame is not robust, & tho' the spirit is willing
the flesh is sometimes weak. I hope when the weather grows warm thou will bathe
It is but exerting a little resolution to overcome thy present reluctance, & thou will
be in danger of growing too fond of it. Bathing has [deletion]such[/deletion] an invigorating effect upon
the health & spirits, & sea bathing doubly so. I do not over & above like the name of
William (though the prettiest of male name) coming involuntarily to the tip of thy

the set - of which she gave Matthew 2 more. In one of them is a fine read of
Burns with much simplicity in the countenance & a little wildness. I think the
picture Martha lent thee something like it. In the other is a beautiful plate of
the Soldier's return, where, "She gazed, she redden'd like a rose." her Lover holds her hand
with great tenderness in the countenance; she stands back to gaze upon him, & looks
quite frightened. The scenery about them is quite adapted to the interview & [insertion]to[/insertion] the hacky

all along, & at present write under unfavourable circumstances, but am anxious to send
it to morro by Betsy. I hope to make amends in my next, but dare not promice.
However I hope there will not mete to me with the same measure. I long to hear of this
tearing tooth-ache being gone. Bathing I hope will entirely wash it away. I am
sure I have much more to say were my scattered ideas collected. My dear love to George

My dear Betsy
I heard thy very agreeable letter
read by A Haughton, I should think that
William North will not be beloved by the
little passengers, since he is so cross to them.
does thou ever bathe now, did thou see Miss
Linwoods exhibition, My Mother is very
anxious that George and thee should see them, Bessy
Linnen is going to Doblin to Marrow, I expect
this letter will be convey'd to thee by her, how is
little George Fowler, I hope George's leg is
better, has thou the tooth ache, at present, is it
very bad thing to have, I never had the pleasure
of its undesireable company yet. I am thine DL

Dear Betsy having the offer of this bit of paper
I write [deletion]a few lines[/deletion] to know how you are & to know
if [underline]I[/underline] might take a copy of Sophia when Ben Haughten
returns it to my mother if thou would not like it that
is enough I [underline]can[/underline] do without it tho' it would be a
pleasure to me to have it, don't be displeased with
me for asking nor don't be backward in refusing
We spent a pleasant Good Friday at Irishtown. thine
