October 1806
Your last kind letter, my dear Friend, is dated the 28th of
Jany, yet long as it has been unanswered, I am persuaded that in
your tender heart I shall stand excused, when you read my sad recital.
On my return to Bath, after the Marriage of my beloved Kitty, I found
your friendly letter, & the very elegant lines it contain'd, - for both which,
accept my sincere thanks, - I left my inestimable Betsy at Sunbury
with her younger Sister, they had long been engaged to pass the Winter
with Sir John & Lady Segard, & the encreased amendment in Betsy's
health made me leave her with satisfaction, especially as she rapidly
gain'd benefit from the exchange of Bath air, for that of Sunbury -
I found dear Lady Bradford worse, at least [underline]I[/underline] thought so, in opposition
to all the Medical people & her own attendants,—but I was fated to be a
Cassandra; & though I daily perceived her declining state, no one would
allow it till within ten days of her death, which took place on
the 6th of March, & I literally perform'd the last sad office of closing her
Eyes — I dearly loved her, & severely felt her loss — All the accounts
from Sunbury had been of the most flattering kind, so that when
I arrived there on the 23d of March, I was thunderstruck with my
dear Girl's appearance! To [underline]me[/underline] she had every appearance of a conirm'd
Consumption,—& when I express'd my astonishment, the whole House
agreed that till within a few days she had been wonderfully better, & they

supposed it merely owing to the change of Weather, that she was then
worse. My Nerves had been too much shook by the sad scene in which
had so lately been engaged with my Friend, to be easily composed when
a beloved Daughter's life was at stake, I therefore wrote instantly to the
first Physician in London, fixing a day to meet him there,(17 Miles
distant) He, confirm'd the sad idea I had form'd, candidly declared he
had no expectation of her recovery,—order'd me in May to go where ever
she liked best,— but early in Septr. I was to take her to Cornwall to pass
the Winter there,— & gave it as his opinion that she was in that precarious
state, [deletion]that[/deletion] it was impossible to say whether she would live 8 weeks,
or 8 years — On the 6th of May we left Sunbury, my precious Invalid
being desirous of going to Coniston,—She bore travelling remarkably well,
& as she wish'd to stop at Matlock, we remain'd there nearly 3 weeks—
She gradually became weaker, but the change was scarcely perceptible
till within three days of her death, which happen'd on the 7th of Augt., —
when she was in the act of dressing — Few equal'd her in talents,
& none I believe surpass'd her in qualities far more precious in the
sight of God - Religion, & reflection fully satisfy me as to the glorious
exchange [underline]She[/underline] has made, — but Selfishness makes [underline]me[/underline] "feel a Mother's
love, a Mother's tender woe." Every paper she has left, breathes such
a spirit of pure genuine Piety, as proves that Religion was her [underline]chief[/underline]

study & delight, & all others subordinate to it — From her knowledge
of Hebrew, she had been enabled to make a beautiful translation of
the whole Book of Job &c, according to their original Poetry, & her corrections
in the different readings in the old & new Testament, are most valuable.
I have mentioned these papers, only to prove the truth of my assertion,
that the Scriptures were her principal study — You, my dear Friend,
who knew a little of this extraordinary Being's worth, will I am sure
pardon my dwelling so long on a subject, which fully occupies my
heart, - but it is time to speak of other matters, - I am now just got
to Edinburgh, to attend my beloved Kitty in her expected confinement
so that you will guess my mind is still fill'd with tender anxiety.
Juliet, & faithful Turpin are with me — Kitty, is really in better
health & spirits than I could have expected,—She has an excellent
House, elegantly furnish'd,— & all looks wealthy around her —
Her Husband seems greatly attach'd to her, & she equally so to him,
I therefore hope she is happily settled — I saw worthy Thos. Wilkinson
in my way hither, we talk'd of you - as indeed we always do - & he
appear'd anxious to hear from you, requesting I would tell you so -
If my friendship has any value, I feel persuaded you will possess it
as long as I live, - for I do not often meet with as much worth &
talents, as I find in dear M.L. — I have lately been reading [unclear]JW[/unclear].

Clarkson's "Portraiture of Quakerism" — by the bye, an awkard Title -
as a work of his, it struck me as being far too prolix, & tedious in
the continued repetition of his subject,— but it has made me much
more intimately acquainted with the Society, particularly the 2d. Vol.,
& I really laid it down, with a wish that I had been [underline]Educated[/underline] a Quaker.
To him from the Serious, to the Gay — do me the favor to send me a
To turn from the Serious, to the Gay — do me the favor to send me a
copy of Mary Knowles's letter about the Literary Wife's [unclear]pudding[/unclear],—&
if you wish it, I will in return [insertion]send[/insertion] you [underline]Learned[/underline] directions for cutting out
your Shifts — I have just enter'd into a Contract for building a
Cottage at Coniston, - more as a speculation to sell my Land to advantage,
than from any delight I [insertion]can[/insertion] [deletion]shall[/deletion] promise myself from it, — for
indeed I feel a perfect void in my heart, & an indifference about things,
which is not natural to my dispositoin — If I shod. have a good offer for
the Estate, I shod. certainly take it, & remove to Bath, — which I think
the best Cradle for old age, & where I should find the most rational
Society, — if such an offer is never made me, I shall at least I
expect have a [underline]dry[/underline] house over my head - I lately spent a day or
two with your old Neighbour Mrs. Keatings (widow of the Dean of Clogher)
She is now on a visit to an acquaintance within 6 Miles of Coniston —
I thought her a pleasant Woman, & the more so, for talking to me
of Ballitore — I beg you to remember me very kindly to all my
Friends
