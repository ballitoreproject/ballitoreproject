My dear friend.
Thy esteemed favour was
tendered me [insertion]by[/insertion] our dear Jane, who I thought
looked more than commonly [unclear]several[/unclear] on her
return from the favored assemblage
she was gratified by even calling on my kind
friends and particularly in seeing thee
but I felt disappointed that thou didst not
join thy friends - my much loved S.S -
it must have been a cross to her affectionate
feelings to be debarred from engaging
the society of those she loves - .
I have been very ill with sore throat attended
with considerable fever - am still in
my chamber. and [insertion]now[/insertion] convalescent - but a languid
uncomfortable feel tires [insertion]me[/insertion] the weather
the admissio of air - which so revives,
me. I have not been on horseback [unclear]frequent[/unclear]
[unclear]to[/unclear] ride in the carriage with my mother
which is not of my [unclear]will[/unclear], as excessive

I had hoped that I was likely to do as others
do - this summer without nursing - but
something always occurs when I gain
a little strength to throw me back to an
invalid -- enough about my poor unworthy
self -- our precious D Stephenson
has healed us with a chit chat letter
to the elder girls in French - she has had
the [underline]comfort[/underline] of rendering [underline]comfort[/underline] to an
invalid gentlewoman from Rutland Street
Dublin. a relative of Leard Castlemane's
who frequently spoke of her mother & these
little babes left behind.. her poor husband
had left Dublin by the advice of some
of the first Mysonine threw and [insertion]with[/insertion] the [unclear][/unclear]
of the first Physicians there. and [insertion]with[/insertion] the assurance
that her lungs were not affected - in
London Dr Babington [insertion]astonished[/insertion] him by saying that
it was an hopeless case - & this only ten days
afterwards - so it proved - for she did [insertion]not[/insertion] long

survive. the movement to the South of France
our dear valued Aunt Abigail appears to
decline- She used some exertion - preparing
to visit at Wendsworth - & very well that she
did not set out -- an [underline]erroneous[/underline] opinion has
spread that her complaint is cancerous
she is not yet over what is termed the change
of life - nor do I believe her poor weak
frame is equal to the struggle - - My dear
mother's health improves - but she feels
the [unclear]thin string[/unclear] - which will be a link off
the chain so many years complete
& remarkable it is that nine brothers &
sisters should outlive 54 years - which I believe
have is about my Uncle Richard's age
I am very much obliged for the plaiter but
sorry thou shouldst deprive thyself of the
whole stack - Sarah was not long applying the
comfort to my back.. this is a sad scribble
I am endeavoring to overtake a person going

in about an hour & have another letter to write
David Malcomonson & his son Joshua had a
sick passage to Milford - I am always glad to
hear from thee - do present my affectionate
remembrance to each of my kind friends.
our neighbour Sir Thomas is gone to his
boy home. his young widow seems to be
agreeably affected. thereby - thy attended E.C
M.L. will please forward
the letter to A.C by post
To be left at Inn at Ballitore
