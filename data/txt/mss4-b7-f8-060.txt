Waterford 21 April 1808
My dear Cousin
It gives me much pleasure to hear of
Cousin Lydia White's recovery a little time I hope may
confirm her in pristine health. I feel a considerable
interest in your anxiety as an author - in all
human occurrences I look upon it the best way
to divert the thoughts as much as possible from
the contemplation of what may create uneasiness
& to dwell on the more pleasing parts of the picture
as there is no remedy for the past we can only
arm ourselves with caution to guard against the
future. I suppose there is now a Canal Boat
in Dublin which will be soon ready to return
if the package for PRogers be separate it
might be delivered him M Ross on the way

but if included in one with mine there are opportunities
every day for conveyance - thou for
Clonmel might also come to me which I will
take care to forward. I must at present
defer enlarging until I have more leisure
With best wishes for you all I conclude
yours sincerely
William Rayner

particularly interested themselves in procuring
me subscription so that I am not to take
to myself the intire merit of the increased lest
I regret I had not the opportunity of
correcting the Press no error should have
escaped for want of diligence whatever might
for want of ability-
