Ballytore April 10th 1740
Dear Mother
This is to acquaint thee that Brother
Thos. Duckett received a Letter last third day from
Corke advising that Aunt Devonshire was much
better and they hoped was out of danger, Brother
Tony received no account since, which makes him
conclude that she continues to recover, for had she
been worse they would have advised him. --
We have got thy Potatoes planted & have sold thy
Calf. - Friends are all well both here [unclear]akd[/unclear] at Newtown
Sister Jenny & Sally join me in Duty to thee and
Dear Love to Uncle Cousins & Sister Betty, thy
Dutiful and affectionate
Son
[underline]John Fuller[/underline]
P.S. Jenny & Molly Fuller
give their Love to you
