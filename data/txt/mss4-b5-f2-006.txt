Cork 2nd of 2nd month 1799
My dear Friend,
I have pretty much determined to write [deletion]th[/deletion] by
BH of Carlow, tho' it should be little more than a line of acknowledgment -
13th of Carlow, tho' it should be little more than a line of acknowledgment -
It was my full intention to do so at some time unless thou should have been the
opportunity of doing it personally about the time of your late [unclear]outly[/unclear] meeting -
yet there did not seem much likelyhood of my getting there - Unreasonable
as it may seem to say it. I did I do gratefully accept, as a mark of old cordial
friendship, thy giving me the interesting detail of sufferings & perils once
little apprehended - Ballitore! When even the last seven years are looked
at, something within me, as it were, craves continued & trouble - sadness -
I am not, dear Mary, forgetting a recent probably the heaviest stroke,
nor do I like to borrow words or expressions - Real sympathy perhaps
is as little at our command as Divine Favour. To open a wound, without
the capacity of administering either wine or oil, is doing little - Such capacity
seem not to be mine: the desire however I believe is not questioned.
We sometimes hear a little of you, not all or always of the pleasant kind -
May nothing be permitted eventually to harm you - & may your Father God
be your's! - Thy poor Mother! Mention me to her if thou thinks well of it --
The money part of our late correspondence need hardly be noticed now.
yet there was something unmakable in it - continue to think of an old tried friend
I. a.
