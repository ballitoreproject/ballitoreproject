DIALOGUE 2.
Menelaus & Proteus.
M. But to change thyself into water, Proteus, is not incredible
being an inhabitant of the sea even to become a tree is tolerable
& when thou turnest thyself into a lion yet this is not
to be doubted. But if thou also becomest fire, dwelling in the
sea this I altogether wonder at neither can I believe. P. Do
not wonder Menelaus for I use to become. M. I also saw it; but
thou seemest to me to put forth some juggling tricks & deceive
the eyes of the beholders when in the meantime thou
dost no such thing. P. How can there by any decei[deletion]p[/deletion]t in such manifest
things? Has thou not seen with open eyes into how many things I have
things? Hast thou not seen with open eyes into how many things I have
changed myself? But if thou dost not believe me & the thing seems to be
false, to wit some void phantom [insertion]be[/insertion]fore thy eyes after that I become
fire stretch out thy hand & good friend then thou shalt see whether
fire stretch out thy hand good friend, then thou shalt see whether
fire stretch out thy hand & good friend, then thou shalt see whether
I only seem fire or whether the power of burning be in me. M.
This Experiment is dangerous, Proteus. P. But thou Menelaus
seemest to me neither to have seen the Polypus nor to know what that
fish suffers. M. Indeed I saw the Polypus but what it suffers I would
willing know from thee. P. Whatsoever rock it meets in its way it
applies its cavities & sticking to it with its claws it makes itself like
it & changes colour by imitating the rock by which means it lies
hid from the fishermen differing in no way from the stone to outward
appearance not becoming manifest by this way, but of the
same colour of the rock. M. They report this but thine is much more
incredible Proteus. P. I know not, Menelaus, what other thing thou
wilt believe who will not believe thy own eyes. M. Seeing indeed I saw
but yet it is a monstrous thing that the same person becomes
both fire & water.
