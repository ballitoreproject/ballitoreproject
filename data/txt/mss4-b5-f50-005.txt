30 Aungier street 4th of 6th Month, 1818
My dear friend,
This day our good old king finishes
his 80th year, may [insertion]the [/insertion]other benefactors of the human race, Royal
or otherwise, live as long! - Apropos to benevolent men, I
had a great deal of Doctor Orpen's company the other
day with which I was very much delighted. Joseph
Humphrey & I accompanied him about a week ago at
7 o'clock in the morning to Richmond hospital to
examine the head of Addington, one of the little
deaf & dumb boys, who lately died in the hospital of
water on the brain. Joseph Humphreys was obliged to return
home to his business at breakfast time, but the Doctor
& I were invited by the young men belonging to the
hospital, of whom Richard Abell is one, to breakfast
with them, to which we gladly acceded. The principal
subject of conversation at breakfast & for some time
after was [unclear]Sparzheem's[/unclear] system, & I believe I never
water on the brain. Joseph Humphreys was obliged to return
enjoyed conversation so much in [underline]Dublin [/underline]before. Orpen
was very entertaining, & so were the others. They
seemed all admirers [insertion]& defenders[/insertion] of the system, & some considerable pro-
I dined yesterday with my uncle Henry at John Fodhunter's. He left town this
morning, on his way to the Ulster quarterly meeting. Did Willian receive the
receipts which I sent him - Hoping for a reply shortly. & with love to all
my Ballitore friends, I remain theirs affectionately

proficients in it, Richard Abell I believe the best. After this
Doctor Orpen & one of the young men examined the ears of
the little boy, to endeavour to discover the cause of his deafness.
In the ear which Orpen examined himself, a defect
was perceivable in the interior canal; of but what was very
extraordinary, the mechanism of the other ear seemed
perfectly natural, so that the deafness probably originated
in each ear from a different cause, as it is likely the nerve
of the other ear was [deletion]defect [/deletion]affected, as the boy had been
perfectly deaf. The Doctor explained to me the structure
perfectly deaf. The Doctor explained to me the structure [deletion]stricture[/deletion]
& formation of the interior part of the ear in a very plain
& intelligible manner, & I now understand it better than
ever I did before. We staid at the hospital until about
half past one, when we both went to the deaf & dumb
school, where I was very highly entertained, not having seen
him before instruct his pupils in person. I staid there for
two hours, & then went home with him. He lent me
a very interesting book on the instruction of the blind, which
he bought at the Institution for that purpose in Paris. It
was printed by the blind themselves which makes it additionally
curious. - That day I consider as one of the most agreeable
that I ever spent. - Joseph Fayle went this day week to
Waterford to Thomas Nevins' to get advice from him about managing
the salt-works. I don't know when he returns. I had

a letter from James a few days ago; he says: "My grandmother is
rather better, she was yesterday able to sit in an easy chair, but
I do not think she will ever recover her speech; it is extremely
distressing to her to perceive that it is with the greatest difficulty
that she can make herself understood by sign."
Please to tell Ebenezer, that I have not got the Philanthropist
yet, but I asked Drydale for it a few days after I came
from Ballitore, & he promised to send for it to London, & send
it to me as soon as it arrived. I intend to enquire about
it soon. Please let him know also that I spoke to Joseph
Humphreys about the spelling books: but that he had some
[unclear][/unclear] answered in all the essentials, [underline]price[/underline]&c.
Please to tell Mary Shackleton that I intend going to
the North in about two months, & that the general meeting
of the deaf & dumb society has been postponed until
the 13th of this month, so that I hope she will come
in time to attend it. Please tell her also that some of the
peace societies do not discountenance defensive war, &
others do. The Massachusetts Peace Society, I believe the
largest is not against defensive war; & I believe there
is one in London not opposed to it, but the other (on
the committee of which are William Allen & Thomas Clarkson)
is against it.
Please to tell Lydia that I don't answer [underline]notes[/underline], nor expect
my notes to be answered, & that it is not likely that
one of the Qauternion will be at Panlaponia on the 9th inst.
& that I see no prospect of my going to Ballitore until after
I return from the north, which will be I suppose near the end
of the 8th Month.
