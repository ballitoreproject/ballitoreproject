From the same to the same

Ballitore 3/7 month 1785

My dear Cousin,

	++++ I returned home from my English expedition with Sally 20th ultimate -- we were favoured to get well along -- & I hope the journey was profitable to both of us -- Providence was kind & gracious in his protection of us, & in making our journeying & our sojourning prosperous -- I could not but mark the peculiarity of it in several instances -- I hope with humble gratitude. +++ On leaving the Dale, Cousin D: Darby would needs accompany us to Shrewsbury -- her company was very acceptable -- she wished us to stay next day their week day meeting at Shrewsbury -- we were almost consenting -- but in the morning something of condescending Goodness seemed to come over us as we sate together, & having had agreeable communications therein, therein we thought it best to part ++ we just got in time to reach the packet which was going under sail -- having succeeded so well in getting on board, we were in great hopes that we should get to Dublin the next day -- but the wind fell away & our spirits & it flattened together. ++ It was tedious to be so long ^at sea^ coming from Holyhead -- but certain circumstances contribute to make it more tolerable -- the sea was calm, unruffled, like a large river -- the sun set with great lustre -- the moon rose with great brightness -- we were not sick -- the porpoises gamboled about the ship, as if to divert us with their play -- the fish offered themselves in shoals & we caught them exceedingly fast, & eat heartily of them -- mostly Gurnet -- but what crowned all -- the wind sprung up the last night in our favour, & we landed in time to be at meeting in Dublin 19th. Samuel Emlen, George Dillwyn & Rebecca Jones were at it, & a baptizing meeting it proved, as well also the afternoon meeting -- We got home next [page number] 87 day, & found all well -- which is cause of additional gratitude. Indeed numberless are the favours which I am daily partaking of -- And the desire of my heart is that I may be enabled to walk wisely, & in some degree worthily, bringing honour to Him & to His cause, who hath done so very much for me.
	After writing the above I went to Newtown intending to finish & send this at my return -- but our meeting of conference there continued so long that I was late for the post, & had but just time to get to our afternoon meeting -- I think such visits & conferences have their use, & perhaps are as [illegible] -- There are many raw people among us, who want to be informed & instructed -- many points of discipline which ought to be explained & enforced -- & where true charity prevails (gospel-love) is the covering of the spirit, under this covering & qualification things of a very close & delicate nature may be spoken to without fear of giving offence -- when the feet are shod with this preparation, we may tread on briars & thorns without being hurt. ++++ The genuine spirit of Christianity seeketh not its own (what it is partly entitled to by way of concession & acknowledgement & atonement) but forgives, & earnestly seeks & desires the welfare not only of friends, but enemies. It is disinterested, not only as to worldly advantages, but as to the honour & reputation of Self. +++
	Farewell, dear Cousin,
