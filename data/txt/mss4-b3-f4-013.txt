Whitehaven 1st 3d month 1783

My dear Uncle

	I may now with a degree of thankfulness to the great preserver of men whom both the winds & waves obey inform thee & our dear friends at Ballitore that ^we^ are safe arrived on the british [sic] shore after a tedious passage of between fifty & sixty hours
	We did not leave Dublin till fifth day morning when we set out with a fine morning & fair wind & in about eight hours were blown almost halfway to Worthington our intended Port but here the wind turned against us, grew high & a storm ensued so that we beat about the Isle of Man for not less than thirty hours & for many hours the air was so thick with snow that the Captain &c did not know where we were, nor into what danger we were running, which was a time of trial but our minds were preserved in a good degree of peaceful serenity, supported by a little hope that at this time we were not given up to the power of this unstable element  last night proved moderate & though the wind never turned fair for us yet by tacking & perseverance we came so near Whitehaven as to prevail ^on^ our Captain to send us on shore in his boat & we landed between one & two this afternoon & find our selves better than we could have expected considering the sickness want of rest &c that we past through
Our friend R. Valentine bore the voyage particularly well is sitting bye & desires his dear love to thy self & house also bids me tell thee that the meeting on 3d ^day^ at Dublin was satisfactory  the men [sic] meeting was longer than friends had remembered ^it^ for a long time & that it was comfortable ^to find^ the labor on 1st day had not proved in vain 
	Our time in Dublin after we lost thee Brother & Lucy hung very heavy on our hands a situation I think I bear ^with^ more impatience than anybody else  time is precious because at the longest it is short & the economy of time is what I have often wished to learn that this mutable probationary state may effect the grand purpose of procuring unchangeable & pure felicity & that it may be sufficiently appropriated to the work of reformation even for the work sake
As I am likewise writing to York & thou knows the unfitness for the employ after coming off the water I hope thou will excuse this hasty incorrect scrawl & give me leave now to subscribe 

myself with the salutes of near affection to thyself Aunt & Cousins in which my R. G. unites thy S. Grubb
PS I shall be obliged to ^thee to^ drop Lucy ^& Sister Peggy^ a line & excuse for my writing ^no^ more to night & this may go before I could write in the morning  Robert has wrote to mother
