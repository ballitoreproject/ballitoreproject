Dr. Tommy,
Moyallon 25th of 7 mo 1765
My Debby Recd. thine to day, & Requested I might
answer it, as she knows little about our hearts of oak
for what she hears in one ear, lets out at the other,
About the Begginning of 6 mo A Number of the
Looser sort of the Inhabitants between Richill & Portsdown
perhaps 400 assembled at Portsdown, visited Squire Obins
Inquired if he was Accesary to the putting on so large a [unclear]Coss[/unclear]
on the County of Armagh (wch. by the by, is not above 3 d per acre)
wch. he denied they then went home [insertion]&[/insertion] appointed days to
visit the other Gentlemen, their Numbers Increased each
time they assembled, they at last Concluded to Strike off
the small dues of the Clergy for wch Purpose they paid
most of that Class in the County of Armagh a visit -
some of whom they swore never to ask ym. more, others they
only made sign a paper to yt. import; their Numbers increased
to 10 or 15 Thousand they all wore Oak Branches in their
hats, when the Inhabitants of that County settled their affairs
the Counties of Tyrone Monaghan & Derry took the Hint
& even exceeded the examples of Impudence their Brethren had
set ym:, & let more eskape with Swearing, the meddle
with none but the Gentlemen & Clergy except it be such as
Refuse to join ym. or have Reasons against it wch they think
sufficient, they are Quite Quiet in Co Armagh, Some of
ym. fired at the Sheriff in Co Monaghan & he made the Army
fire on ym. two was Killed, 5 Wounded & 14 taken prisoners
in County Derry One was Killed the other day by Capt. Rankan
& his party of Soldiers at Dawsons Bridge, I believe
while the army stays things will be quiet, but otherwise
I fear Not; in this County we are at peace, & I hope
will, In many places the mob [deletion]out[/deletion] [insertion]was[/insertion] a Dismal prospect
3/4 of ym. being papists & almost all armed wth either Guns,
Swords, Sythes fix'd on poles, or other frightful Weapons
We are pretty well thro' Mercy, old & young, Debby
goes on wth the nursing bravely, & is finely our Dr love
Attends thee & thy father wch. please to present to him
we wd. be pleas'd to hear oftener from you I am thy affte
Kinsman
Jno Christy
