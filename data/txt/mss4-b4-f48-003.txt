My dear Betsy,
I am loth to send James without a line as I fear thou thinks I neglect
thee, but when we meet I can assure thee it was not a wilful neglect. My
spirits are a good deal deprest at hearing of the death of my old friend Wm.. [unclear]Nutt[/unclear]
& I feel exceedingly for poor Fanny, do tell her so with Wms.. & my dear love: for Wm..
greatly regrets his loss. Thus, as wave succeeds wave, do our generations pass away
various are the trials allotted us by Him who pitieth us as a father pitieth his
children - some at one period of life, some at another - we weather through, attain
perhaps what we call happiness - but the end comes to all transitory or temporal

enjoyments. They talk of thy coming next week. Need I say I long to see thee?
any of us repeat that assurance? I will be obliged by thy bringing me
[unclear]drab[/unclear] silk for a bonnet [insertion]& white lining[/insertion] - I never thought to wear any but black again
but for the wedding I believe I must alter this thought, especially as I
doubt getting any thing else new. I am not disappointed in my Nephew eliot
I am only afraid of proposing too small satisfaction to myself, & that in some way
or other I must be brought to the ordinary level - I long to know what is in thy
letter which arrived to day, but suppose I shall not till after I send this off.
I wrote a few lines to thy Aunt lately. I am afraid she thought them but few
I seem quite out of writing letters you cannot think how I was bewildered with
[underline]that book[/underline] - I wrote to Richd. Colles twice. he has not answered. If thou could call on
him & get my papers [unclear]with[/unclear] copies of Burke's letters to me - I think one from his wife
the Bishop's letter & his latin elegy & two translations I would be much obliged. I
hear he is going shortly to the Isle of Man for a few months. I wish thou could
also get thy father's big, old Virgil which I suppose he has. that if necessary I may
copy the Latin of 13th.. book as Dr.. Bell wished I should have it printed with the
English. If thou would call on Dr.. Bell & bring me word from him whether he has
got those from the Counsellor I would be glad. That is if it was easy to thee. If thou

knew the Dr.. I think it would. Robt Fayle would go with thee I believe. he might meet
thee at E: Johnson's. to impose on thee, my dear? if thy Aunt was in town with thee
she would be the one - I fear [unclear]Mother[/unclear] absence will deprive me of the opportunity
of getting the latin (which I suppose would be a loss) ) if not got soon from him. The papers
I wish [unclear]Agnes[/unclear] to [unclear]see[/unclear].
thy [unclear]MC[/unclear]
[unclear]Find[/unclear] the enclosed by him
