My dear friend
I recd thy letter by Jno Whitten inclosing 6-15-6 for J:H
& wch. I intend forwarding soon - we are much obliged to thee & our frds.
in Ballitore for recommending Bess Lennon - so far she acts very agreeably
& I hope will continue to do so - her predecessor did so likewise
in the beginning but soon declined - we hope better things of
Bess - pride is a baneful ingredient of human nature & not easily
eradicated - My sister Higginson & children spent last evening wth
us - she speaks very highly (& I believe deservedly) in praise of
the kindness of thy Nephew Abraham Grubb, poor widows
have need of the kind sympathy of every feeling mind & the
world (notwithstanding all its degeneracy) is still blessed wth a
few up & down who can & do feel for them - the extended
& calamitous [insertion]situation[/insertion] of thousands of the poor in this town & neighborhood
are very great indeed some little has been done & doing
for their relief - but the mass of misery is so great - that
one does not know where to begin or end - I often think of
but too rarely practice the Sentiments of Godwin - who I
think says "there is not one individual who has a right to
"indulge himself in any luxury whatsoever - whilst there is
"within his reach another [insertion]man[/insertion] in want of the necessaries of life"
if this be true & I think we have no reason to doubt it how
can we without blinking assume the name of christian
farewell my dear Mary & the way to farewell is to do well
my wife unites in love Thy affte frd Saml Haughton
