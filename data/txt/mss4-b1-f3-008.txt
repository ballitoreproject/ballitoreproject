P. 53						“London, 2nd of Sixthmonth 1760.
“There really seems a good hand at work, to gather and bring things into better order. Fifty eight Friends offered themselves willingly, to visit the monthly and quarterly meetings in the Nation; and I hope they will have the hand of the Lord upon them, to work for Him. I thought my heart was a little like Deborah’s, when the narrow path was not sufficiently occupied, and those under the profession of Truth had taken to by-ways, that my very heart rejoiced, and was with the willing in Israel, that offered themselves to the work.”
