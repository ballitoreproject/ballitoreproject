Carlow 31 January 1809
My dear friend
I acknowledge thy kindness in sending me the manuscripts,
and as thou did not mention, whether for my amusement or animadversion -
I have presumed up [insertion]on[/insertion] the latter in a small degree at a
few leisure moments - and pined a few observations on several of
them, & marked others with a black lead pencil proposing an alteration
of a few words & the omission of others - this liberty I have
not taken with an intention to impose my sentiments, but meerly
for thy rejection or adoption as thou mayest think best - I fear I
have made too free in my [unclear]exercises[/unclear] but as these are only done
with a pencil they can be readily effaced wth a bit of Indian rubber -
I wish also to give thee a little more of my sentiments
on the subject - before publishing I woud recommend thy procuring
a few more (I was going to say interesting) anecdotes to intersperse
among those collected - for altho they are designed [insertion]& may be interesting[/insertion] for children
yet men will read & criticise too - and as we happen to live
in so book-making an age - now become an article of traffic, &
many competitions in the trade - those who appear on the stage ought
in some degree at least, accommodate their style to public taste
& fashion - I shd. be sorry to make any observation to hurt or discourage
thy good intention - yet I have my fears that this little
collection without a revision & addition, will not receive a favourable
review from the public - I woud not write in this freedom
to any one I did not love & am satisfied my meaning will be well
received by my friend - I recd thy note this evening & intend forward

the manuscripts by the Coach tomorrow. I write this at a late hour
having reviewed a great part of them very imperfectly indeed - since
rect. of the note - The introduction written by thy friend has considerable
merit - and by no manner if means lessend him in
my estimation - and I think with his friendly assistance - liberal
& comprehensive mind - these little stories may be ornamented (without
a deviation from truth) to considerable advantage both to Parents
& children - as they now are, many of them appear too triffling for
the press, & others (I fear) too highly painted - and [unclear]words[/unclear]
in some of them wch. to [underline]me[/underline] appeared not sufficiently guarded
for an author [insertion]& writer[/insertion] of Truth
Affectionately farewell
SH
