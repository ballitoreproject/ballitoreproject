My dear Lucy
I was sorry thou forgot Emily's book which I think will give her pleasure
in reading, I send it by my mother who I hope will have fine
[unclear][/unclear] during her visit, if such a thing may be expected
weather during her visit if such a thing may be expected
at all - I am in town getting "Dublin clean'd" out" & an ugly job
it is, I hope little Jane is well again I was sorry you had so uncomfortable
a return, there is nothing so tiresome in travelling as to be
closely pack'd [insertion]in[/insertion] this is the great [deletion]curse[/deletion] [insertion]dif[deletion]f[/deletion]erence[/insertion] of the railroad
Carriages where each person has a seat in which there
is ample room divided by a barrier from the next
seat, I was less tired coming from [deletion]land[/deletion] London to
Liverpool by the railroad than I was a few days after
going to Ballitore in the front of the Omnibus, perhaps
I may see Francis to day if he is coming for my mother
thy SB

Lucy Malone
