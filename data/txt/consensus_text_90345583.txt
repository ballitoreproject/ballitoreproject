the excursion tho' just 12 O'clock and
what was my surprise and delight
when Ned of his own accord proposed
our going - So the end of it was
that we [underline]did[/underline] go yes indeed I could
scarcely realize it - Ned, Miss Harvey
Alice, Margaretta, and I went in one
covered car - Mrs Musgrave, her two
children and Mrs White in another -
There were two outside cars also
and the Doctor drove himself Mrs
Barter, and Mrs Disney in [deletion]another[/deletion]
a phaeton -. The road was very
pretty - Miss Harvey very entertaining
and the drive was very pleasant.
Mr Matterson came to the back of
our car just as we reached the
avenue leading to the house, and
walked the rest of the way -
On our arrival we all unpacked
and following Mr Barter went
to see the pretty lake and
scenery - an old ruined castle
added greatly to the beauty of it.
