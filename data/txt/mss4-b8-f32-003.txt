Dear William
I must be a gain troublesom to you as I have no a quaintence
in Mt Milicke that would wish to trouble - I send by Mary
the scirt of an old gown to make a peticoate would take it
as a favour if you would speake to Mrs Marlin to get it
don for me as she would get it don beter & cheaper then
it could be don heir you will give her money to by -
srowiden to line it & silke to quilt it be so good to send
by Mary one stone of whiten by it yourself selfe for when
I sent befor she was imposed upon & mead to pay
mor for a pound then ought to be paid for a stone

Altho' my beloved Sister's lines come signing my
condemnation like: yet I think they breathe affection
[deletion]too[/deletion] also, & therefore welcome to me, Tis said the
rich have many friends, & if so, not like to want
human consolation; but my dear let us learn
to look higher, than to our fellow mortals for
comfort, if we do not we will, no doubt find ourselves
disappointed~ As Mary [insertion]say's she[/insertion] cant wait
any longer must break off, send by her 1 lb.
Whiting - will endeavour to get the Petticoat
done for thee- so for this time farewell -
I hear you often visit our neibourhood but never coms
neer me will you do well to requite evry one acordin
as the [unclear]dispirits[/unclear] so he is many degrees mor worthy your
atention then me but do not think I obraid nor I scorn
it adieux
your afectinate
sister C Harper
