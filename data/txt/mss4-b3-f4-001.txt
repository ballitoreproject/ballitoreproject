Bush lane [illegible] day morning

	Will my beloved & greatly honored Friend excuse the liberty I take in this way expressing ^a part of^ what my breast was too full to allow me to do on our farewel this morning & with which it still glows in earnest sollicitudeLet me be remembered by ^thee^ when favored to intercede with fervent breathings to the Father of the family for the preservation of the weakest of the flock of which truly I am one& oh let me share that parental counsel & instruction which infinite wisdom may communicate to thee for my ^help^spare not I pray theeI feel something of that disposition (& may it ever be retained) which can say let the righteous smite me &call that is within me is prostrate in the humbling sense of the many blessings descended already & in some degree dismayed in consideration of the snares & gilded baits proceeding from the different sources of self love laid in the way to draw from the simplicity of the gospel, a purity of heart & the milk of the word & of my very frequent inability to gather to the name of our God or to look towards his holy habitation
	Thankful I am (that I have had the opportunity of being enabled to subdue a host of opposition in myself in coming to this peace) to be personally acquainted with one who I esteem (I think I may say) with filial affection a Father, an Elder, a Judge in Grace, who is skilled in digging with fervent zeal for the wellspring of life & in dispensing it where refreshment is to be communicatedmay thy days be peaceful & manymay the olive plants about they table shoot forth their roots in the divine nature, as Lebanon to the rejoicing of thee & they kindred spirits & to their everlasting establishment & oh may I in deep abasement of soul ever be worthy to subscribe myself a companion of thee & of the flock says thy very needful but greatly obliged Friend in much haste S Tuke
