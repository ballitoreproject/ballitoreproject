were left to mind the house. Philip
did not return from Ballyman [unclear]till[/unclear]
after tea. I have been pretty busy
to day between, writing letters, gardening
settling my cloths, riding, gardening
again, and reviving my old tunes
on the piano -. Papa Mama, Charlie
all came out this evening
x15th.. I had a letter from Polly to day
enclosing one from Liddy. They
had been invited to spend an evening
at Tully lish, but as they expected Mary -
White and Anna Webb, the invitation
was declined. Charlie went to town
and came out in the evening as
usual.
16th.. As Papa was going to town I
took advantage of the car and
taking Anna with me we drove down
with him. This was a very warm
day the thermometer was up to 69 at
about ten O'clock. After dinner
I had a very pleasant ride on the filly.
