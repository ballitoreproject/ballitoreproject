My dear Eliza
I received thy note &
although I satisfied my
mother about my getting
cold - yet I may as well tell
thee myself, I got no cold
yesterday & I did not miss [underline]pat[/underline]
thanks to thy nice warm
piece of flannel, ha! ha! so
the bachelors begin to go as soon
as ever I leave home, alas! poor
me has no luck. so [underline]he[/underline] looked
charming thou thinks and since
[underline]he[/underline] could not do less than
return the compliment.
I went to see my Aunt Manliff
to day she is finely quite
cheerful & pleasant, I also paid
Emma Gamble a visit and am

to dine there today, so thou
sees Sam at last going to perform
my promise, I am writing
this behind the desk at No-
4, and have not much news to
tell thee yet, there have been
fresh orders from Dunlavin,
Jos Jacob got what he calls a
flourishing order from Frank,
which is good news, So the
 Fennells are gone, and they would
not take the Accordion. how
dost thou mean that Mr J-
is like that nasty man J Gatchell
I dont understand thee
write to me soon again,
it was very provoking that
the Henrys should call the
very day thou wert out
how cross-purpose-like things
sometimes happen with
dear love I am thy affect.
Sister Selina
P.S. Does it not look suspicious
that JBH should stay so late
not knowing it, he must have
 [unclear][/unclear] himself [underline]very much[/underline] [unclear]pleased[/unclear]
& [underline]entertained[/underline]. tho[unclear][/unclear]
we heard that a [underline]rash imp[/underline] was
willing to give it up, well I
heard since I came to town that
[underline]she[/underline] would not but that [underline]he[/underline]
was quite willing & I was very
sorry for having displeased his
friends, so it is hard to know
what to believe, I heard also that
[underline]he[/underline] was talking of going to
Van Dieman's land. I believe
he is not gone to MtMelick as we heard
but is in Dublin farewell
