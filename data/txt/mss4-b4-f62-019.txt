My dear sister,
since to care for, & accompany cousin Abby Haughton,
we have had considerable fears respecting her state
of health of late, & wished her to send for Dr. Maharg,
but she was reluctant thereto, yet consented to come
for a few days here & be under his care, & I being
a loose sort of a body am come with here: the Dr.
thinks rather unfavourably of her I believe. But
what I particularly wished to write to thee about,
was sister Chandlee; - some time ago I had a pitious
letter from her, mentioning her wish to go to service,
& indeed it seemed to indicate her [underline]determination[/underline]
so to do; she said she thought their friends (who
had so kindly contributed to setting [deletion]them[/deletion] [insertion]her daughters[/insertion] up)
could not object to their taking in their father
if they left the Brewery, wch. she much wishes: -
Brother Abram said he would be willing to allow
£10 per year (for the present) towards paying Jane & Debby
for her board, this I have since told sister C, & that
I would give 10 more; - the dear creature seem'd
pleased, & the girls quite willing to have their mother
Carlow: 22/11 mo: 1806.
I came here a day or two
mother,

& think well of the £20: - But upon considering
the addition to their expence their father little John
& a servant would be, it seems a difficulty to press
the matter: Sister C & I have talk'd calmly & comfortably
about things much more so than common
my heart achs for her: I talk'd of writing soon
to thee, - she desired I might not ask you to contribute
to this last proposition as you had her two children;
but I was thinking if it was made £30 it might
make the other additions to their family easier.
I do think it would be very desirable to get them
out of their present situation, for several reasons -
brother doing nothing, & as well as I can understand
it, things in a confus'd way: the young-man's
conduct not always agreeable. If they were away
from that, I think sister might get a little
amongst her friends, & she needs a little comfort
if it could be procur'd for her. I have just
written this as tho' I was talking to thee without
reserve, I know neither thee nor brother Saml.
[underline]need[/underline] stirring up to remember & feel for her, - [underline]you[/underline]
have acted a truly kind part: but I had a
mind, some how, just to throw before you all
[underline]I[/underline] knew, thinking some mode might occur to you
how

how to get them out of that place. I hope you
are enjoying satisfaction in your pleasant prospect;
brother & thee are delightful when you are in
spirits; - thou so entertaining, & dear Saml. rubbing
his hands, while his eyes beam pleasure, & swim
in thankful feelings: dear Richd.! I hope he may
experience many happy days before those of trial
come. I love you all, & am particularly (my
loved sister) thine in true sisterly affection.
