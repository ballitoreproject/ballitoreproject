From the same to the same

Dear friend,

	+++Aldborough Wrighton left us 23d instant intending for Cork, & thence either to Mallow or Bristol, as he should afterwards conclude. He thought he could get a conveyance to Bristol more readily from Cork than Waterford. In the mean time the look-out of our friend J.G. will probably be of service against his arrival there, if he ever arrives there; which seems doubtful. However, I have some hope that if this disorder continues its rapid progress, he will, after these storms & tossings of affliction which are necessary for his purgation & refinement, arrive at a port of rest. [pencil] ^x^ Oh, my friend, throughout all our dangerous voyage [pencil] ^through this life^, let us steadily make for this [pencil] ^the^ port [pencil] ^of heavenly rest^, our eye ever & anon looking at the card & compass, whether we feel we are going in our right course according to the will of God. I am greatly mistaken in the deepest of my feelings, if His eye is not in a particular manner over thee & thy beloved companion for Good: he has visited you with the day-spring from on high, he has filled your cups with his blessings, & surrounded you on all sides with his favour. Say what will ye render to him for all his benefits? Devote your heart, my dear friends, to his service, who has called you, not to be idle spectators, but to labour in his vineyard. If ye faithfully & in perfect dedication obey this call, a fight [?] of afflictions awaits you, the world will despise you, & false brethren will lift up their heels against you: ye will eat as it were the bread of sorrow, & drink many a bitter cup. But [pencil] what then? The Lord Almighty will be on your side, he will cover your heads in the day of battle. As ye persevere to fight under his banners, ye will find not only the enemies of your own houses, but the adversaries of ^to^ the cause of Truth, flee before you, & ye shall be enriched with precious spirit. +++
	I am, my dear friend,
		very affectionately thine
			Richard Shackleton
