very cold. Papa went in this
morning -
30 Wednesday. Clear fine cold day.
Papa gone to town. [insertion]He went[/insertion] in the new
carriage to Bray to try it.
31 Thursday; Florence and Jane
who came [deletion]back[/deletion] to spend yesterday
with us left us this morning
with Papa. This was a lovely
clear day - the sky almost cloudless.
except over the sea where there appeared
to be a long dense cloud. It
was very cold and is freezing now
I believe - 10 P.M. Papa intended
to go to the Lord Mayor's dinner to day,
so is not coming out to-night.
End of January.
