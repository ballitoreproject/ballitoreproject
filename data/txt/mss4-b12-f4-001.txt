My very dear Cousin,
The account of the removal of my well beloved
friend, thy dear sister I received this day, which gave my heart
a pinch, under the consideration that I must never again
behold her in this life [deletion]&[/deletion], I repeatedly looked with satisfaction
to a period when I might enjoy her desirable society in my
own habitation; but it is all over, I review with some
consolation her life, & therein have a comfortable Hope that
all is well with her, I remember the honesty of her intentions
& sincere Love to the Cause of Truth, & though
I believe she thought she could do little for it, yet it is
my opinion she did what she could & rejoiced to see its
propsperity, & to see others qualified to help forward the
great & precious Cause, from my knowledge of her, I
believe Self in her was in [insertion]a[/insertion] good degree mortified, & subjected
to the Cross. & as Divine consolation was her chiefest joy,
I trust she is now entered into that joy, where there is no
mixture, where all afflictive dispensations cease, & the
inhabitant of the land shall not say "I am sick." Before
I heard of this event I had an inclination to write to her,
as I heard she was very poorly, & gone to her Brother
Watson's but I procrastinated, & now she is out of my
reach, my dear Abby! I hope in her Mansion of everlasting
repose, [deletion][/deletion] may I [insertion]also[/insertion] when that solemn moment arrives

find mercy & an admittance into a Mansion of Rest.
Thou my dear Cousin must feel a pang at losing this
friend & sister, but thou knows where to flee to in time of
trouble; it was very grateful to me to hear thy dear daughter
Mary was spared longer to you. I wish to know how she
gets her health, & whether it is pretty well established,
my dear love is to her, & her Husband, also to James & Mary.
I should also desire to know how thy own state of health is,
I felt a longing when I heard thou wert in Leinster to see
thee, as I can say in sincerity my friendship is not lessened
for thee & thy sisters. I may say so of the dear deceased
as I love her memory; shall I ever see thee in our House?
I think I feel how I should enjoy it. We have but a
short time to be hear, daily experience convinces us thereof,
& how pleasant to behold each other, & to hope that we
shall have an inheritance in a better country hereafter would
be a consolation in every trial. My dear Cousin I want
to solicit thee to watch over my dear niece Sally Handcock
for good, I believe the precious visitation of heavenly regard
has attended her, & may she not lose the sense thereof, &
as I believe the great Master has appointed Fathers
& Mothers in his church, so I address thee, as one I
hope will have a Maternal eye over her for Good, a
Work [insertion]seems[/insertion] to [insertion]be[/insertion] begun, I wish it may not be frustrated by
any
alluring Will of [unclear][/unclear] Adversary, who not only goes
about as a roaring Lion, seeking whom he may devour, but
also as a cunning Wily seducer, to beguile from the path
that leads to an Eternal crown of Glory.
Those few lines my dear Cousin, tho' hardly fit to send, are
the product of much feeling for thee, & now shall conclude
thy very affectionate Cousin,
Margt Grubb
Clonmil 7th of 5th mo 1789
P.S.
This has been detained by an uncertainty where to find thee, my
Husband being returned encourages me to direct to thy house, he joins
in dear love to thee, thy affectionate
