Staynor Hall 8 Mo: 20.. 1809
Dear Cousin
As a particular friend of thy
Sister Sarah's, whose name I have forgot
is kind enough to take me this letter,
I thought I would not let slip so favourable
an opportunity has now presents
itself to me, of writing to my much
esteemed Cousin, of whom I have hea[insertion]rd[/insertion]
nothing for a long time, I may
now inform thee, that my two Daughters
and myself intend going to
reside at Selby at my Fathers house

my eldest Son, having got married a
few weeks ago to a very respectable
young woman of the name of Dobson,
with the consent of his and her, friends
so I think of leaving him, at Staynor
at the Farm. Samuel my other Son,
has a situation at Selby, he being
an apprentice to a Grocer. Cousin
Frank Carbutts, youngest Daughter
got married about two years ago to
a British wine merchant of name of
Tettaler, much against her Father's
mind her Husband, not being a friend.
Cousin Hartley, has buried her Husband
more than a year ago she and her
great pleasure to hear from thee, should thou at
any time have an opportunity of writing to me.
I should like very much to see thee, but that
I fear I never shall the distance between us is
so great. My Children altho, unknown to thee,
desire to join with me, in dear love to thee, thy
Husband, and Children, and believe me
I remain with the greatest respect
Thy Affectionate Cousin
Jane Shilleto

of my writing I dare say she would
send her love to thee, thou wilt be so
kind as to give my love to thy Brother
and Sisters. I by chance heard of thy
poems, so had a desire to purchase
