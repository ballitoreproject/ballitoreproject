My dearest Aunt
Your letter was
a great comfort to us
this morning I intended to
have telegraphed to you today
if I did not get it - for I was
in a woeful way about
you; none of us could get
you out of our minds. I think
all will go on well now -
you ought not to write yourself
a few lines from Uncle
would tell us how you are
going on & what Dr- [unclear]Nelaton[/unclear]
says about it you ought not
to leave him till it is safe
for you to do so. What matter
about your return tickets in
comparisons I had no idea

you had bound yourselves
to time - We wont mind the
scar on your face if you come
back [underline]well[/underline], we would rather
have you [underline]well[/underline] with it, than
not well without it - I often
wish I was with you, you get
it done so quietly it was all over
before we know any thing about
it. Your letter on Saturday quite
surprised me as well as upset
me & to see your handwriting
this morning was a still greater
surprise I could hardly read
your letter
I hope you get mine this morning
I intend to write to you every
two [insertion]or three[/insertion] days whilst you are a
prisoner, I told Margt & Polly
to write too.

Mary White is not very
well & confined to Bed she did
not come here since, I was

there yesterday & have promised
to let them know about you
Grd- mama sends her love
& says she is glad the operation
is over. - Poor Honor was quite
effected when I told her about
you on Saturday
Did you get my letter this
morning & Gr ma's & Margt Beales
few lines I have not seen
Mary Beale yet - Margt Beale

Very hot weather here [unclear]east[/unclear]
winds & no clouds we had
no rain here since you
went, Tuesday evening the 9th
A fine shower went over [unclear]Ballyman[/unclear]
it did not come near us
but left the air so cool that
the thermometer fell 15 degrees
from 70 to 55. We felt like
Winter - they had frost that evg-
