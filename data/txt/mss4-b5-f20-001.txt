Dublin 1 July 1816
Dear Mrs. Leadbeater
Permit me to offer
for your acceptance two copies of
my drawing of Ballitore. They may
Mrs. Leadbeater
bring to your recollection the old
Ballitore
adage "Long Threatening &c." but be
assured that I have been tedious in
complying with your request I was
not by any means unmindful of it.
With affectionate regard
I remain
Your's very truly
Anne Breth
Letter
not yet to be
burnt
