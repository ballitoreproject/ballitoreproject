Paris HÃ´tel Wagram June 14th
1850
My dearest Mama.
I wrote to thee
on Saturday 8th telling how I arrived
here &c. and sent it in one of Aunt Elisas
to Grandmama wh I hope you received
I also wrote another yesterday to Miss
Browne enclosed in one of Uncle Thomas
to Mary Henry [insertion]he[/insertion] asked her to [unclear]forward[/unclear]
it on as that is the only way I can
get letter's sent to you. Aunt Eliza
is so much taken up in writing to
Grandmama or Aunt Martha she
does not write to thee and I suppose
she thinks I am enough as I always
[insertion]write[/insertion] whenever I have an opportunity of
sending it as we are at home
this evening and have nothing to
do I thought I would write this and
have it ready if Aunt Eliza should write

by post tomorrow, The three of us
went yesterday to the post to see
if there were any letters, but got none,
Uncle Thomas then got some money
changed and the weight of it was so
heavy towards what he had, that we
came back here to leave it, we were
not long here till Uncle Thomas
found himself unwell and laid
down on the bed, and Aunt Eliza
 (thinking that he would be angry if
we would not go out) told me that
she & I would go out to amuse ourselves
we found our way to "Notre Dame de la Lorette"
and we thought ourselves [insertion]very[/insertion] brave to get there
and back again without Uncle Thomas we
arrived here in time for eight oClock tea
after which we went to bed, I suppose thee
is wondering why I dont tell thee what
it is that is the matter with Uncle Thomas,
it is the bowel complaint - Aunt Eliza says
that one is very apt to be that way when
they come to Paris, as the water here has that
effect, he did not venture out to day at
all but kept quiet, Aunt Eliza & I
went to the Poste this morning I was
in hopes to have got one from
home but we did not get any, so I
hope "no news is good news", we then
went to the Abattoir de Montmartre
but we were not allowed in so could not
see the cattle, we then came home to
see how Uncle Thomas was getting on
and having eat something we went
out again, we went to the Louvre
to see the Sculptures as we did not
see them the other day, and then
to the Bourse and having amused
ourselves, [insertion]for[/insertion] sometime, walking about the
streets, we returned to six oClock tea
We had beautiful weather ever since
we came here except, odd showers wh
were soon dried up, the clouds look
very heavy to night and the wind
high, Aunt Eliza has just said that she
did not think there was such wind in
Paris, it makes a noise sometimes

very like our "Irish wind", Uncle Thomas
as thee knows is always guessing one
about one thing or another and for wan[unclear]t [/unclear]
of something better he is at me abou[unclear]t[/unclear]
a young soldier[deletion]s[/deletion] [insertion]as[/insertion] he was the first and
only person that paid me a complimen[unclear]t[/unclear]
since I left Ireland, when we were
walking up the Boulevarts the other
evening we came to a fountain &
Uncle Thomas as was his usual custom
washed his hands in it, when the soldier
came and told him that he was
not allowed and to show him that
he was not angry with him, he said
"vous avez une gentille demoiselle"-
I forget the rest, but Uncle Thomas is
joking me about it ever since,
He also says that I am growing fat
since I came to Paris and that I
eat a great deal more than when I
was in Liverpool - let it be what it
will' I am better than when I was in
England, for while there I got my

usual spring cough but it is entirely gone since I
came to Paris. This is Uncle Thomas' birthday.
15th I wrote thus far last night I will try and finish it
now and tell something about the people. The poor people
here are the greatest contrast to those of Ireland
They have a very good gown on no holes in it a large
handkerchief pinned tidy over their shoulders, a clean
apron with pockets in it and [deletion]a[/deletion] very clean tidy nice
little caps, those that have not hankerchiefs have collars
with coloured ribbon, the same of which is on their caps
a bow at each side and strings to tie, they have none
across the top, these caps are made of plain or fancy
muslin but very few have net, This is the way they
go out to walk with a basket in which is their work)

on their arms, I like this class of people better than
the others they dress by the day of
think very right some of them have a nice dress on
& [unclear][/unclear] but that is all in fact we have met with very
few of what we would call respectable people since
we came to Paris, Yesterday when we were
out we saw them building wooden houses w[underline]h[/underline]
could be taken asunder and moved, they were
very curious but I dont think I would like to
live in one of them I believe I have told all
the news I only wonder I made so long a letter
I wrote so lately and we did very little since.
give my love to all and accept the same thyself
thy affectionate Daughter Emily Malone
I forgot to say that I saw a very curious cat yesterday
 I think it was more curious than the one without a
tail in the Isle of Man, this one had a large head
and face a long broad bushy tail and very long hair
it was altogether a very curious Cat.
