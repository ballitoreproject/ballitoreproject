From the same to the same

Ballitore: 21/8 month 1773

Dear Cousin,

	Cousin Sam Carleton brought me a sort of a friendly challenge from thee, which I accept of ++++ I have much satisfaction in giving thee from time to time a good account of such of thy boys as I have had opportunity of forming a judgment about; those who are my present pupils continue to behave in such a manner as is very agreeable, & are commendably industrious at their learning. I wrote to Richard some time ago, suppose he is so busy with the world that he can hardly spare time for letters of friendship. Cousin Sam tells me that he is bound apprentice, I doubt not but he feels a stronger tie to bind him to every moral & religious duty. I wish his stability, his preservation from every hurtful snare, & his making choice of best & durable riches.
	Probably ye have Robert Willis among you now. He is a living memo monument of ancient Gospel-simplicity. What a tendering power [?] attends him manifesting his commission to teach baptizing. It is this virtue, accompanying a few simple words, which strengthens the root of life, when long declamations without it, though set off with the pomp of language, minister only death. I would be obliged to thee to remember ^me,^ my wife & children very affectionately to him the good, old man.
	I find ye are going on very spiritually with Matrimony-affairs. It is much to be desired that these engagements were rightly entered ito, for the sake of present & future advantage. It is an excellent thing to build a family [page number] 170 on a good foundation, to plant from good stocks. We are not old, & yet we may have observed how much both this & the succeeding generation seem to be affected by connexions of this sort. May we, who are heads of our respective families, & who have had repeated cause to believe that this ground-work has been laid by the drawings of best wisdom, be preserved waiting for renewed ability to walk acceptably in the sight of our great Benefactor, as good Way-marks in our families & living members of the Church of Christ. ++++
	I am, dear Joseph,
		affectionately thine
			Richard Shackleton
