Margaret had to leave at the
Harris's for Dr Harvey. On
our way there , or rather
on our search for it , who
should I see looking at us
from a window but Lizzie
Coventry , so after some cogitation[deletion]s[/deletion]
Margt Polly and Philip
went to the gate of the house
thinking it might be Mary
Simpson's place we were
thinking of looking for
better lodgings , and so
it was as Lizzie Coventry
who came out to us, [unclear]informed[/unclear]
Margaret. However she
and her brother Samuel.
had taken the lodgings , so
we could do no more than
content ourselves with what
we had - After leaving
them we went to the Harris's
