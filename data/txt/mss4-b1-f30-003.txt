A Vision.
In the night season as I was in my bed, whether sleeping
or waking, whether in the body or out of the body at that time I
could not tell: I thought I saw a proper man clothed in white,
his garment very plain & fair, & he had the moon under his
feet, & was clothed with the sun; he said unto me, "Young man,
"come unto me, & I will shew thee great things, which shall
"some of them come to pass in thy days." I drew near to him, &
he said he had many things to say, & bid me write them. Then he
told me, "God had raised up a people out of the sea of Rome, &
from the midst of Babylon, many of whom sealed their testimony
with their blood in the midst of the fiery flames; after this God
visited a people even their offspring, whom he chose as his peculiar
people, convinced them of the royal law, many of whom suffered
much for their Testimony; but since he had done all these
great works for the Nations, & [insertion]had[/insertion] brought out of darkness those [insertion]his[/insertion] peculiar
people, they had too generally forgotten God; for which a small
number mourned & were bowed down; & the Lord will surely visit for
those things the Protestant Churches & Nations, both in the old
Country & North-America; he will, as he has shaken the Earth,
shake it again, & wars & commotions shall much cover the earth, & many
shall be slain; then, Oh New England! will he threaten thee
with his rod & with an overthrow, but as his mercy continues for ever,
will he help you with a little help, when you shall be in pain as on
every side; then will your deliverer deliver you from the hands of merciless
men, not by the arm of flesh, but by his own arm of mighty power,
he will turn your enemies back, without so much as striking one
blow, & the Nations shall have some quiet for a short space. But
because of Irreligion & the crying sins of Pride, oppression & the making
slaves of the souls of men, will he visit you again, & shake terribly
the Earth, & many shall be buried in the rubbish of the Earth; Paleness

shall be seen in their faces, & many shall be surprised in
their beds, he will bring on wars & rumours of wars, the sword shall
not prosper in your hands, you shall begin to tremble & fear, & he
shall raise up a Nation against you which was your friends, a despised
Nation, even the Heathen in North-America shall
slay & carry captive your People, young & old, the blood of the slain
shall run like streams of Water, & the Earth shall be dunged
with the bodies of men in many places of North-America. Then
shall your mighty men fall back, Oh North-America, thy sins
are great, thy punishment is great also; the sword shall be sheathed
in thy bowels until[deletion]l[/deletion] thou repent, Oh New England, thy distress
shall be very great thou art full of oppression, & thy sons shall be
[insertion]oppressed &[/insertion] slain in Battle. Thou that thinks [insertion]thyself[/insertion] strong shall be weak.
Oh North-America, thy distresses shall come, one upon another,
one after another, until[deletion]l[/deletion] a suff'ring & trying time come more &
more upon you. Your young men & young Women shall be brought
low, & bow at God's footstool, Fathers & Mothers shall mourn apart,
sons & daughters shall mourn apart, many shall go into captivity
& fare hardly: many shall desire death, & it shall not be granted.
Famine shall be felt in some places, others distressed in a Wilderness
with a savage People, many shall be slain in cold blood, the
cries of the poor shall enter the [insertion]streets in the[/insertion] Cities & Towns. One continual trouble
shall follow another until[deletion]l[/deletion] the Inhabitants bow in reverence & true humility
of mind, with cries to their helper[deletion]s[/deletion], & your young men & women be
bowed down & seek their God. Then shall your Inhabitants that
know of God rise up with that old spirit of persecution, in which
time many shall be gathered to the true fold of rest, your young
men & women stand for the honour of God, & his chosen People
& Church appear in Beauty & Purity. Your young Men & Maidens
shall run to & fro publishing the Gospel in the dark corners of the
Earth, even at the seat of the Whore of Babylon, & man shall suffer
great persecution; then shall the old whore have on draught more of
the

the Blood of the saints, but a short one; For he will raise up the
Powers of the Earth to help his Children & Church, & deliver his
servants; & the gospel shall be declared unto the ends of the Earth,
more fully than ever it hath been before; the God of mercies will
make his Church shine more & more, & oppression shall cease
among his chosen People." So said, eh took me by the hand & bid
me farewell. And when I awoke I was sitting up in my bed
& cried, "O Lord, what have I seen"!
