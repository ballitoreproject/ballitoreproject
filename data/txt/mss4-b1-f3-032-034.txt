		*** I greatly desire the welfare of some of my young friends in a very particular manner; but the warfare between the spirit which is not of this world, and the spirit that is of it, is great  and difficult: the situation of some makes it more so to them. And the Being, who is the source of all our happiness in time and eternity, is a jealous Creator, demands, (as is his just right) the whole heart, and will not accept of a partial sacrifice: he requires the prime, the best, a whole burnt-offering. Mayst thou, my dear child, steadily resign thyself in all humility to be guided in his wisdom, so sitl thou be preserved an exceeding great comfort to me, a blessing to the family, a way-mark, a good example: and an ordinance of help to thy near and dear friends, whom thou lovest, and by whom thou art beloved. Thus thou wilt be preserved out of the evils which are in the world, and the perplexities, perturbations, and troubles consequent to them; thou wilt grow from stature to stature in the experience of good; and though, in taking this cup of life, (which is a cup of mixture,) thou mayest expect to meet with trouble, yet thou wilt still find and feel the reward of they diligence, faithfulness, and obedience, to be peace.
	My love to thee is such that I could willingly enlarge, but I am seldom in a situation fit for this manner of converse, when I am here. And besides, there is an unction which teaches all things that are necessary; truth in the inward parts, to which I refer thee as the most sure counsellor, fully capable to instruct thee in all things appertaining to thy spiritual progress, and to bring all things to thy remembrance in due course; supplying abundantly the lack of instrumental help, and making up every deficiency to those who are acquainted with it, all other advice & assistance will stand us in little stead. **
					Thy affectionate father
