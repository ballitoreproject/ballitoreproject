Richmond 1st mo: 29th 1829.-
My dearest Sarah.
It appears long since I heard from thee
though thy last is still unanswered -& will remain so
I suppose for I cannot lay my hands on it now. -
However I have quite enough to say to thee without it.
All my young ones are very ill with a heavy cold
I suppose influenza - & to be sure we have a
hot house with them, however it is nothing
that occasions uneasiness of mind, though plenty
of that of body - Poor Mary is the worst. - & Willie
is nearly recovered. I often envy the Hoffs
it would be so delightful to live in the same
neighbourhood with thee, dear Sarah. The
rest of us are in status quo - Oh ! how I am longing
to see thee here. But you are busy in Dublin
or rather at the Glen. - for Frank has asked
for Lucy, I understand. - I hope she may be
as happy as her unobstrusive merits deserve
she should be - Thou must tell me all about
it - or I shall be vexed, for I have a great interest
in all these girls & a very considerable affection
for them. - I feel fonder of them the more I see
of others for I think there are not many who
possess so many amiable and endearing qualities
& so little the power of displaying them. - other

people make a vast deal too much fuss about themselves
& they make infinitely too little - which is
the best plan ? I hope thy mind is at rest about
poor little Margaret - & that she is recovering &
that then, my dear Sarah, art well. I have not heard
from Ballitore this long time & I have taken it into
my head that Hannah Boalre is dead or else
very ill .- but this all from fancy. - May [unclear]Bentham[/unclear]
takes this. - I have not received the candles
yet. - M. W. will bring me any thing then may
have to send, for instance a fent chamois
[unclear]& mins[/unclear] - & a good shiny large tortoise shell
comb for my back hair & two large side
combs for Sally. - I would thank thee
to send me a comb with long strong teeth
I care not for its beauty, When I get thy
bills for all I will send an order for the
Cash, - We are all as hearty as the sick children
will permit; - but they are very interrupting. for
I intended writing a long letter, & lo! I can hardly
scratch a line, for them. - I must quit for
a while. and entirely - for I have not now
time to add more. - James's dear love
& mine to Edward
thy affte L J Fisher
