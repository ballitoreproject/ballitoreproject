returned with us after meeting, she
would not however stay to dinner
as Uncle James was alone. Debbie Chandlee
and her two brothers Thos & John, their Uncle
John, Sally White Mary and Joseph
Shackleton dined with us - Papa
and Mama came in to meeting, and
returned by the six O'clock train.
I saw several of my old schoolfellows
but no Deborah - without whom I feel quite
lonely indeed. There are not many
strange ministers I think this year
and the meetings appears smaller
than usual. Thos, Polly, and Charlie
have gone to tea to Johns - Mary and
I declined going, so had our little tea
to ourselves - To cure a troublesome cold
which unfortunately I have got I intend
going to bed soon. We are to have
a party to-morrow evening.
8th.. month 1st.. Did not go to meeting this morning
I had such a bad tooth ache, and Polly
staid at home with me. till Thomas
