Richmond 20th of 3rd month 1827.
My dearest Sarah
It is very long since I heard from thee, or even
permitted thee to hear from me - I have no excuse for I have
time to write - much more than thou canst have, & my heart
often turns fondly towards thee - yet still Nay succeeds to day
& the time passes without my having said "I love thee". Deborah -
our line of communication tells me that you have settled for the
present near Dunleary, & that she means shortly to join you.
I rejoice to hear it, for after all thy anxiety & fatigue the
country breezes must be invigorating.- I hope Edwd feels the
benefit of the sea air - oh that the summer may brood over us
all in peace & happiness - what a sad year of trial last has
has been! - it was doubtless intended for our good & I hope we
may prove it to be so.- that speech is not a bit like me &
yet [underline]I[/underline] wrote it. Beth James & I are very doubtful that the
accompanying order will cover our family's
debts to thee & Edw.d however it will lessen
them & thou canst tell me how we stand. I believe
James would have sent this long ago - but it
entirely escaped his memory - he has a great many things to think of
& his time is greatly occupied - I have other things I want thee to get
for me - but I will not teaze thee about them until thou comes into
town. The only allay to thy being established in the country is that
I fear it will delay thy promised visit to us - Ah! when shall we see
thee - not a single fine day passes but I think how pleasant it
would be wert thou here. - Well time who brings sorrows - brings
pleasures too - & this is what consoles me under every thing - Ah! our
poor Richard! how fearfully ill he was - & I knew nothing about
it until he was better - through kindness & it was kindness - for
when I heard of his first illness which was not nearly so bad
my heart sunk within me. I did not know where this fever would
end & I feared its merciless ravages. Tell me about the children
Ah why would thou not trust Margaret to me - I was greatly disappointed
- for I did think thou would perhaps send her - however
she will be welcome whenever she pleases to come I suppose Johnny
is a great [underline]Hee[/underline] - & how does Sweet William proceed - does he flourish
& put forth his buds vigorously - I often wish I could take a peep
Our garden is beginning to look gay with the spring flowers the crocusses
and snowdrops are gone - but the jonquils and a few other flowers are putting
out their yellow blossoms I think the colour of Spring should be yellow
instead of green - Ever dear Sarah - with dear love to Edwd
Dear Friends - Mes chers amis- I am long in your debt
both in money & words- I wholly forgot the 6 pound. 0. 6 to George Downes but I
hope that remittance will nearly cover all- I beg that Edwd will state thy acct in
his next - my acct is as under
stopped by St Patk Inst 9 6
George Downer's order --- 6. 0. 6
Sallys seat to the North 1. 4. -
Fur tippet for Lydia ---[underline] 1 18[/underline]
[underline]99 12 [/underline]
Spicer - I dont know how much
& possibly other things I forget
now- I have got a commission from D Malcomson & Sons for selling thin
Calicoss manufactured at their great place in the County Waterford- I xepect
this will pay me pretty well in time - manufactured goods are now however
my loss I write this because I flatter myself my little affairs are not
uninteresting to you - I have begun in a very small way but am not at all
disposed to despair of doing pretty well - I have rivals in the trade who are
able to do more because they are established & have the advantage of [underline]capital[/underline] -
you must come see me in the Summer for I should be able to go
If there be any error in the [underline]sums[/underline] for they
are entirely from imperfect recollection you
will be kind enough to alter them - I am
a good deal confined to my business but
not quite as much occupied as I could
wish however all trade in my line in[unclear]stall[/unclear]
Thy affte sister
LJF

at you all - ours are flourishing fast & fair. Mary is a bonnie
little thing - says a great many words & walks a little alone but
is very cowardly & prefers having the security of a finger. - She is
no beauty being a thorough Fisher. Joseph goes on at the old rate
riding an ass - &c, &c, & living in blessed ignorance of his letters & every
other trouble & is within three days of being three years old - now
our sister Elizth read when she was that age - Oh the degenerate
times! Jose gave us a good fright the other night being seized
suddenly with the Croup - however it was quickly conquered &
he has had no return. - It is a frightful complaint.
Mary has eight single & two double teeth & is cutting others fast
she does not suffer much - but even her little suffering is hard to
bear. Often I think of what Walter & Maggie suffered & so hold my
tongue & bless my kind stars. I mean to send a parcel to Ballitore
via Mountmelick in which will be a little one for thee containing
gloves & stockings which wandered from Britain Street to Richmond
truly a long travel. Thou heard of little Anne Allen's birth. - I was
rejoiced to hear poor Nell got over it so well. I write in haste
as James will take this into town for the post & I hope will add to this
[unclear]not soon[/unclear] a tilt
fortune - I hope
see you any more
until I am rich
enough to go to Dublin
to buy goods &
then I can only stay
one day - I am
settled down now
to try & make my
yourselves & your
little ones are benefitting
by the out-of-town
by the out-
of - town air - I
am deep in the study
of theology & metaphysics
where I have
leisure from Commerce
& [underline]Education[/underline] I leave
Richmond every morning
between 9 & 10 &
return about 5 - I
find the children

Did you see
It is very funny -
sort of a fellow -
[unclear]Taylors[/unclear] Holy Liturgy
is an amusing
[unclear][/unclear]th John Joseph
a great source of
amusement & recreation -
I am studying
the doctrines of Necessity
& Free will - I am
inclined to believe in
the former - & that the
latter exists only in
appearance - I have
got Queen Mab - I
recd half a dozen books
in both sides from
Dublin the other day
for I like to be impartial
on hearing evidence -
I am sorry
the fools in authority
have run their heads
against that poor
enthusiast Taylor in
London - Could they
not hear [underline]both[/underline] sides
Your affectinate LJF
