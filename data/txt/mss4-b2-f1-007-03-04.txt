My dear James,
	++ Some persons are such standing epistles in my heart, that I know not how the correspondent account stands with them +++ Unfaithfulness I hate, for it spoils good company, mars the feast, clamps the cheer, & destroys the harmony - when that captivity is turned back how different has been the experience! "Then was our mouth filled with laughter, & our tongue with singing: then said they among the heathen, the Lord hath done good things for us: whereof we are glad" +++ After staying a few days at the Dale, & after I had added another strong fold to the cord of friendship with Richard Reynolds, & renewed old amity with them all, after we got Anne Summerland's & Abiah's blessing, & I had left thy salutation among them, we held a consultation what way we should steer - we did not long deliberate, but with one consent concluded to go to Manchester and pay a visit to Sarah Taylor. Accordingly we went & qua tarried there a few days, & took the most seasonable opportunities each day of sitting a while with that old Saint - her communications were fresh, lively & savoury - she spoke of the immense ocean of love & life, that she was about to launch into, & in the nearer approach to it seemed the more ravished with the prospect of it. Good was very sensibly near - & it was strengthening & encouraging to be witness that when the life has been uniformly devoted to the promotion of his blessed name cause, the great, the munificent Master provides most nobly & liberally for the comfortable & happy close thereof, causing the faithful, devoted, though naturally-disabled servant to speak well of his name, to rejoice that they were ever counted worthy to be honoured with any portion of his service, & to triumph in the earnest & anticipation of their glorious everlasting reward. At last we took a solemn farewell. [page number 222] It is doing justice to that dear creature, Anna Taverner to say, that notwithstanding her deficiences & sins of omission, too often repeated to her wounding & hurt, yet in this late excursion she has divers time in publick & private been engaged in the beauty of holiness to come forth in her Master's name - & I do hope she will stand a monument of divine mercy & goodness, & be strengthened from time to time to advocate his cause. This Anna is in every respect a beautiful creature.
