Bytore 9th of 2mo: 1826 -
To Edward Maguire
I recd. thine this morning - if Fearon
approves of the draft Renewal it may be engrossed -
he cant proceed with the other business of the purchase
till my Renewal is executed - I got the assignmt.
&c: very safe - P Fitzsimons did not bring the
Bonds or judgmts. from Kilkenny so we must
wait awhile - Some of this money was lent to
T: Christy in 1806 - I find by a memorandum in
my own handwriting - & I have also a Rect. signed
by my sister Higginson for Â£24 being the Interest
of 400 pound for one year due & ending the first Janry.
1808 which T. Christy never took up from me
thy sincere frd.
