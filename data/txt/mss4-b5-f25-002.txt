Leeds 1st mo 18th 1786
Dear Cousin,
Notwithstanding I wrote thee so
lately & have nothing of consequence to communicate
unto thee; yet am unwilling to loose
a convenient Opp' of transmitting a few lines
to Dublin by a neighbor & intimate acquaintance
of ours who sets out in a few days for
that place where he is likely to be near
three weeks, if can conveniently give us
a line in return, may get it to Joseph
William's wch place I mean to send this
not doubting his care in forwarding it
to Ballitore may acknowledge we received
thy acceptable Lett' by our Esteemed friend
Robt Grub last Seventh day even' (who we
were pleased to see) just as we were reading
ye affecting account of ye Shipwreck
of E. Lovell & J Sparrow (by thee-) to a neighbour
whose husband is to convey this to Ireland,
who wth ourselves cou'd not avoid being
affected - we had that day been much engaged
perusing ye fruits of thy Genius--partly owing
to Thos Pim being dining wth us &c (as he
has been here since ye Quarterly Meetg. &
proposes sending thee a Lett' wth this) led
us to talk of Ballitore & thy works - he is

Ansd. 8/2----

to send me Copy of ye Description Ballitore &
some other things & I am to send him some
Manuscripts in return. - I am oblig'd
to thee for thy kind remembrance of my Wife
whose Health continues only indifferent, seldom
being very stout; I have been favor'd wth pretty
good Health of late wch I ought to be thankful
for, my little Babes thrive finely, my
two eldest were Innoculated about twelve
Months ago & got well thro' ye Small Pox
I purpose inclosing thee Copies of two Lettrs
respecting ye Death of our late worthy Frd
Robt Walker, thinking they may be acceptable,
the former was inclos'd in a Lettr to
his Son by Joseph Row - Shall be pleasd
to have an Oppy of seeing Geoe Dillwyn's Wife
Poor Thomas Ross remains I believe
still poorly & weak at York, tho' perhaps
may get abroad again. Robt Grub may
write some account to you, as I told him
I could convey him a Lettr, wch if come to
my hand shall inclose - Don't doubt but
you wou'd be much pleas'd wth your visitor
ye two Winter's past, don't hear where
Wm Mathews is at present - Our Frd
Mehetabel Jenkins & M Davis left Leeds
Third day after our Quarterly Meet:g taking

Meetg in their way to Lancaster Quarterly Meetg
likewise Patience Brayton & her Companion Phoebe
Blakes left this plase ye same day - Phoebe had
been with her into ye East of Yorkshire & now
has set out wth her again, her return is very
uncertain - We heard of Rebecca Wright
M Routh &C Phillips being very lately at
Plymouth - R Jones is at John Hustlers
& hardly knows wch way she will go next.
Rachel Hartley a relation of thy Sister
desires her Love & is well
Yesterday Reb Jones & C Hustler attended our Weekday
Meeting & in ye afternoon we drunk Tea wth them
at ye House of [unclear]R. C. Elam's[/unclear] (one of ye Sisters thou
may perhaps remember) & had a very agreeable
visit - don't know whether she will write by this
conveyance or not as I mentioned [deletion]my[/deletion] my intention
of doing it; I believe they propos'd leavg Leeds this
day but as an account came yesterday of the
Death of our valuable & much esteem'd Frd & distant
relation Nathl. English think they may stay
at Leeds over First day, as it is not unlikely
but he may be interred at Leeds; Suppose he
had got wet of his Feet three or four days ago
wch brought on a Fever, he was not thought
to be in danger [deletion]as he had[/deletion] but was taken ill
in ye night - being found almost speechless
when they went into his room in ye morning &
only continued till noon - Another Friend
(who had a Son liv'd in Dublin wth. Robinson &
1 mo 20th Sixth Day Eveng.

died this day and our friend
Joseph [unclear]Tatham[/unclear] is in a very bad state of Health
I think dangerous- May such examples have
of ye uncertainty of our stay here be a means of
promoting our diligence in ye necessary work of
our Souls Salvation, for sooner or later ye sermons
will be sent to every one & well will it
be for all those that are in readiness, for we
know not at what hour we may be call'd to give
up our stewardship ---
Reba Jones is on her way to York & Boston
where she proposes spending a few days previous
to her & S Grubs setting out for the
West of England - I hear Tho Ross grows
rather weaker, that his confinnance in this
part is very doubtful -- Shoud like to have
ye acct of thy Grandfathers Expressions &c (wch was
printed) very much - if cou'd send it to Joseph
William's in a week or two, believe I coud have
it per retn of Beaver - notwithstanding I told
thee in ye begin of this Lettr I had nothing
p.lar to mention, yet thou wilt find I have
nearly fill'd this sheet, wth hope will be
acceptable - think of finishg this Lettr tomorrow,
as ye person does not leave town hall
then, it being our market day thought wou'd
prepare it thus far - S Hird C Elam & a many
other Frd i.e. B North family &c. desire thee
Love to thee & all your Family - 
Brother, wch wth this is forwarded per Wm Townsend to Dublin
Please to deliver ye inclos'd letter to thy
Give my respects to thy Bror  Chandlee & accept  our
Dear Love not forgetting to remember us to all our
relations at Ballitore - remaining Thine [unclear][/unclear]
Seaenth day Eveng.  Fras. Carbutt
