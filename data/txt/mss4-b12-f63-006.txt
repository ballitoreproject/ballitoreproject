W.F.
Respected Friend
Did I not beleive thy good nature equal to
thy Ingenuity I wou'd not give thee this trouble, as such, there needs
I trust no other Apology for requesting a little of thy mathematical
assistance.
The case then is this - a very good friend of mine
has lately made over to me for my separate use and benefit,
a certain Estate, yet the extent of premises makes it (thou
mayst well think) of some consequence to know the number
of acres contain'd. As soon therefore as it may be convenient,
be so kind by rule & compass, to find out the same according
to the inclos'd outline of the plan, supposing it half an inch
to a chain - the specks within the inclosure need not interrupt
thy admeasurement, being only relative to the buildings
And now, though it may not seem necessary to the
above business to describe the buildings [underline]particularly[/underline], yet I
am inclin'd to think a description may not be amiss,
till there's an opportunity of having thy Judgement in
a

a full survey of them - in the mean time I am about to
make a perspective drawing of the whole Premises.
The [underline]houses[/underline] are in good repair & most of them occupy'd
notwithstanding which, I shall be very glad to part with them
upon proper terms, being likely to have some trouble with the
Tenants, for although they have nothing to depend upon but
their own care & industry for their subsistence, by which indeed
they live exceedingly well, yet they are so shortsighted & selfish
that do not imagine they have any thing to spare, thinking
very little of their Landlady against pay:day; & when-ever
they are apply'd to, they immediately fasten their Doors, which
makes it very difficult to get at them, for I understand it's not
lawful to break open an Englishman's door when lock'd or
bolted. I shall therefore be glad to get fairly rid of
the estate, though fully beleiving they will [underline]not[/underline], by the next
proprietor be treated with the lenity & forbearance I have
already shewn them. Indeed it goes quite [underline]against me[/underline] to
dislodge them: notwithstanding which, several of my acquaintance

[insertion]have rashly urg'd me[/insertion] to break in upon 'em even by force of [underline]arms[/underline] but such
proceedings are in my opinion much too violent, for though I
cannot stomach their uncouth & cold behaviour to me, yet I am
certain their credit in the neighbourhood is such, that were
they once turned out nobody would again lett them such dwellings,
& they must consequently remain destitute, & exposed, a
prey to devouring want! These [underline]houses[/underline] are strong, substantial
& well built, a sort of stone rough cast - the slated roofs -(a
material uncommon in this Country) are well cover'd & in
good Repair; yet some of them in heavy, stormy, flooding
times have not been always kept quite drop dry.
They are very snug, & neatly finish'd within; & though
not ornamented more than is common for tenements of small
rent, yet they are quite comfortable; the walls being well
white-wash'd, & really furnish'd with exceeding good taste.
Some part of the fixtures will be allowed to remain in
the houses after they are quitted by the Inhabitants, and
one

one wou'd naturally suppose such well accomodated Tenants,
who have no leases, would deem it far the best policy to pay
their rent when due rather than run the risque of an Ejectment
I am with much Regard
thine &c.
