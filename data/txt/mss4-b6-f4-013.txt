New York 5th Mo. 22. 1821.
My dear Friend
When I refer to the date of thy
last truly acceptable letter (9th mo. 17th), I am really almost
ashamed, from the length of time that has elapsed, to
take up my pen & attempt a reply, lest thou may
have already erased my name from among the list
of thy correspondents.- however, I trust to thy well known
liberality for an acquittal on the charge of negligence,
when I plead as an excuse for my remissness. 1st. a
long journey from home, which consumed more than
three months, & 2d. the melancholy domestic intelligence
which lately reached me, & which for a time upsetted
me for social intercourse of any kind.- The loss
of two beloved sisters & a cousin, whom I had left in
the full enjoyment of health & happiness, created a gloom
over my feelings, which in the hours of meditation, distorted,
perhaps improperly, every surrounding object, &
infused into my spirit something akin to misanthropy.
- but, when I reasoned with myself in the moments of deepest
thought, I felt convinced, that as the change, was
no doubt to them, one of eternal gain, it was selfish
in me to repine, at what was irrevocably fixed - The
account of their last moments was truly gratifying, as
it plainly demonstrated the efficacy of Religion, when all

outward medicines had failed! -
As there are several enquiries, & observations which require
noticing, in thy letter, I shall take them up systematically
as they occur, in order to dispose of the whole.
First then. - Henry Grattan arrived here whilst I was in
Kentucky, & simply left the letter at A.Bell's office,
without a message for me - nor has he called on me, since
my return, so that I have not yet seen him.- I blame
myself, however, for not having endeavoured to find him
out, as I should like to serve him, if in my power, & to
talk, about the "Classic vale-" to which my thought often
revert with feelings of reverence & affection.-
Thou regrets not to have seen John Griscom - he frequently
chides himself for the very limited time he allowed
himself in Ireland, as he had a great desire
to travel generally thro' it.- He has not yet completed
the corrected manuscript of his Travels, so that I cannot
give thee an idea of the period of publication - his
Lectures on Chemistry, Natural Philosophy, Mineralogy-
&c take up a great part of his time, & break in upon
his domestic economy. - I am on very intimate terms in
his family (of eight children) & pay a social visit there
whenever I feel so inclined.- his two eldest daughters
are fine girls. - I urge him strongly to go to Press. -
The "Sketch book", is the best specimen of native
literary genius, that has appeared for some time, in
America, & it has raised the author (Washington Irwin)

to a proud pre-eminence among his countrymen, & even
in England, where he resides at present.- We have been
looking for another number, from his pen, for several
months past.- Every arrival from England, brings
us copies of all new publications, & those that appear
likely to [underline]take[/underline] here, are immediately re-printed & sold
remarkably cheap.- thus "Kenilworth" in two volumes
sells for 1.3/4 dollars.- - I have looked into "the life
of R. L. Edgeworth," & have read the Edinburgh review
of it - I intend to finish the work itself, by & bye. -
Has [underline]she[/underline] [insertion](Maria)[/insertion] exhausted her rich fund of story, or is her
pen once more busily at work, for the reformation of
some fashionable foibles? The visit from her step
mother must have been gratifying to thee. -
Sir Walter Scott's son was a competent witness, I think
relative to the authorship of those delightful novels
which have been so justly extolled throughout the
literary world: I must say, however, that I think
there is a danger of his writing too much, for some
of the last works are in my opinion, decidedly inferior
to the first ones that appeared.- We are now
looking for the "Buccaneers." - It is generally
believed here that they have come from the pen of
Scott; but why does he not avow them?
I find by [underline]Tommy[/underline] Fisher's letters that he is pleased
with Edinburgh, tho' the pride of her Inhabitants disgusts [insertion]him.[/insertion]

He thinks they are [underline]too loyal[/underline] to the Court of St James'
- which, thou knows, in his eyes, is a [underline]radical[/underline] defect.-
By the way, if I remember correctly, when I was among
you in Ballitore, we were [underline]all[/underline] good subjects to
his Majesty - & wished well to the cause of what we
considered - Liberty - against the tyranny of Napolean-
but since then a great change has taken place in
Tommy's sentiments.- & nothing good can emanate from
the present Ministry, in his view.- I certainly would
advocate a reform - a moderate one - but I would no
more suffer the body-politic, to be operated upon by
the Radical quacks, than my own body, by a mad
physician.- In this Country, where the offices to be
obtained are insignificant compared to those in England,
I have seen quite enough to disgust me, with annual
elections & universal suffrage - the "sovereign people"
are far more easily acted upon, by prejudice & party
rancour, than by truth or justice.- & really, in some cases,
do not, I conceive, know how to govern themselves.
- such an expression here, would be "high treason," &
subject me to all the anathemas of a democratic press,
but I believe [underline]to thee[/underline], it will sound like good sense.
I was much obliged to thee for the
enclosures in thy letter.- I [underline]did[/underline] fancy myself sailing
down the Griese, & sighed that it was not a reality.
What a pleasing addition, [unclear]I[/unclear]. Bonham & his lady must be
