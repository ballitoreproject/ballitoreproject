Ballitore: 21/7 month 1771


John Christy
Dear friend ^cousin^, 
        I received thine of 15th, for which am the more obliged to thee, as thou wast so much indisposed when thou wrote. I believe I need not say that thy illness gives us a particular painful concern. The long friendship subsisting among us, the opportunities of reviving it every now & then by the pleasure of seeing thee here & elsewhere, the strength & comfort which thy honest, faithful, devoted labours for the welfare of our poor society afforded to us, & the prospect & well grounded hope which we seemed to have of thy future service in this cause, cannot but have rendered thee very dear to us, & the loss of so near & dear particular a friend after our late heavy loss in my dear & venerable parent, must & would very grievously affect us. However, we know such things are amongst the trials & probations which attend, here & that these trials & this state will all in a little time have an end. The Lord Almighty rules the world which he hath made with wisdom far transcending our vain reasoning & contracted knowledge. He gives & he takes away with equal propriety. It is the duty, & should be the business of us poor, uncertain creatures, to endeavour to submit all our faculties, our lives, & every thing appertaining to us, in humble resignation to his will. The swift transit of a very little time levels us all, & those who go before, precede these that follow after, by a very little space. Yet, my dearly beloved friend, while I thus recommend to us a subjection of all to the ordering of Infinite Power & Wisdom, my mind secretly petitions that it may [page number] 50 be consistent with these Divine Attributes to prolong thy stay amongst us. If such be his gracious pleasure, I trust that we who are most intimately connected with thee by the strong ties of nature & christian fellowship will manifest our gratitude for so great a favour by a still deeper dedication of All to the service of our Benefactor: but if other be the purpose of his decree, yet I am persuaded the integrity of thy life, thy charity, thy humility, thy diligence to discharge a conscience void of offence to God & Man, & thy honest, faithful, assiduous attachment to the cause of Christ, & hearty desire for its promotion is & will be accepted of, & the comfortable answer of Well-done will assuredly be thine at the last ++++
        I hope one or other of you will be so kind ^as^ to keep us constantly advised how ye are. May Divine Providence be near to comfort, sustain & relieve saith
thy truly affectionate friend & kinsman
