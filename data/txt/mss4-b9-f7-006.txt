Dublin August 31.st 1837
My dear Elizabeth & Richd
I got your joint letter
this morning with orders on S Fayle & on
J & W Haughton for Â£250 and went immediately
to Thos Crozier. I did not see himself
but one of his Clerk's shewed me an Indenture
which I suppose is the one in question. I have
just now recd a note from them informing
me that 12 oclock on Monday next is fixed
by Jane McBrides Attorney for the purpose
of receiving the money and executing the deed.
I shall attend also at that hour, but would
wish to know whether Crozier will take
care of Sarah Shackletons interest and whether
I have anything more to do than pay
the money when he desires me. If he is
employed by her and that he says the instrument
is properly drawn up, may I not pay
the money without further questions? Excuse
my troubling you for a reply at this anxious
time, but as I am in great measure ignorant.

of the [unclear]transaction[/unclear], I cannot act on
my own judgement. If there is anything else
in my power to do either here & or in
Ballitore do not hesitate to tell me so.
I did wish to go down to you & see [underline][unclear][/unclear][/underline]
once more but a letter which I have
just read from Betsy L to Sarah will
I believe prevent me. yours affectionately
Mother
EB
I suppose Sarah has reached you
ere this I hope safely. The young
man whom I saw at Croziers told me
to write to Mr Leadbeater to request he
will have his Rent of [unclear][/unclear] which
he took under the Courts [unclear][/unclear] to Mr
Murray the [unclear]Recr"[/unclear]
