My dear friend
Knowing thy willeness to oblige we
take the liberty of troubling thee to get a few
a few things for us which MD forgot when in
town - first is to get a[deletion][/deletion]beam & scales with Copper
bottoms- & a sett of weights from 2lb to 1/4 ounce
the scales should be large enough to weigh a lb
or more - the need not be a high price, perhaps
Thos. or Frank Johnson wd get them for us -
& save thee the trouble - the next is to pay John
Taylor Castle street for ribbands & to get his reciept
please to remind him, he is to allow discount
£11..11d is his bill - but the discount is to be taken
off - thee is also to pay Frank Johnson for the
watches &c, & Abby for the Hatt which she promis'd
to get for Mr. L - we send by Dr. Nowlan ten guineas
in dollars & a six shillen token which makes £11..19..6d - & a guinea note
inclosed if it should not be sufficient please to
draw on us for more - now I have finished our own
business it is time for me to inquire something of
thine how is thy printing going on - we are all

wishing for thy return, has thee heard any thing of
thy scotch friends since you parted - all friends here
are well M: Webster getting finely, Lucy has been sent
for to day & intends going to Cooper hill this evening,
I need not enter into particulars respecting, how we
get on as I know Betsy writes to thee frequently
please to give our dear love to E Johnson & all
the family, & accept a large share thyself from
thy affect. friends
M & A Doyle
[Mary, Anne]
