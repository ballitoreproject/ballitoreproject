E Jacob is staying here for awhile:
Mama brought Richard and Anna
to the exhibition to day - Aunt Cole
called to see E Jacob who was however
out. Cousin Eliz Barrington came
up from the North arrived just in time
for dinner which was later than usual,
waiting for Papa who was to return
from Naas where there was a fair
held. After tea Papa Mama, the two
children and Margt went out to the
country, so John and I had to
expect ourselves to entertain our
two guests. Uncle Arthur called to
see E Jacob who had unfortunately
just gone to bed, on account of
a cold which she had. Uncle A's
visits are so few and far between
he was quite a welcome visitor.

whom I left in it as I could not
well stay long there. E Jacob being
