Friday Evg.
My dear Selina
In the Drawing
room after tea
- just home from
Belfast - accompanied
Mary
Jane & [unclear]Jeremy[/unclear]
from Madden
to Belfast & part
there on a car
on their way
 to Muckamore -
saw Margaret
at the Madden.
she got your note
this morning -
There is nothing
particular to note

here - I arrived
home at 1/2 past
5 o'c - found a
sharp frost on
the ground when
I came north
of the Newry mountains -
altho' there
was very little
appearance of it
South of street -
there was frost
last night again
- it has thawed
very little to-day
& there is likely
to be more [deletion][/deletion]
[deletion][/deletion] frost to-night
- so that there
is little chance
of hunting to-morrow -
at which
I suppose you
wont be sorry -
The House seems
strange & lonely
without you &
I shall not be
sorry when the
time comes for
you to return -
I quite intended
but entirely forgot
to say something
to your father
about coming down
to see us - it will
perhaps be time
enough when I
am up again -
I would be glad
he had arranged
to bring you home

but I should have
thought of this
sooner - if you
think well of it -
tell him I should
be very glad to
see him here -
James was cleaning
the windows to-day
& Rose tells me
she dusted the
drawing room all
down - believe
me your ever attache
husband

Edmondson's was
shut yesterday &
I could do nothing
about the Knives -
