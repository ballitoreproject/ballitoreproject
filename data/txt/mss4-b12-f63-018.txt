William Foster has been engaged Visiting families in the Monthly
 Meeting of Richhill which my sister Abigail (as I [unclear]hear[/unclear]) was
 not - John [unclear]Conran[/unclear] was with him at all the Monthly Meetings
and I think at the Publick Meeting in a Village near Lurgan
notorious for rude disorderly People but where the Meeting
was remarkably satisfactory and William so furnished with
invitations to Rightousness that a methodist Teacher queried
if such was the Doctrine to that description of People what must
 [unclear][/unclear] be in our own congregation this detention in families will keep with
boundaries expectation in dear love to all

[unclear]R[/unclear] intended to have copied the act. on this end of the
paper but SG forgot to leave a vacancy for the [unclear]direction[/unclear]
