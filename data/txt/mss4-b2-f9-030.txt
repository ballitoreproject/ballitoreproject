My dear Cousin,                                                Ballitore: 15/11 month: 1778.
	It is not for want of thoughtfulness about thee that I have been silent while thou hast been in trouble. Bare words are easily spoken: but to minister consolation by words or any other mode is not at our command: There is a Treasury, a Repository, but we do not keep the key of it. Thou knowest it to be so. It has been opened for thee by him who keeps the key: he has fed thee out of it, & sustained thee with hidden manna. his love was always to thee, & his Chastisements have been the stripes of a tender Father. Yea, I believe he will never leave thee, nor forsake thee. Thou hast past, & may have again to pass & we all have had to pass through the gloom & horrour of the shadow of death in respect to our near friends & Relations - but the Arm of Gods power is sufficient & it only is sufficient effectually to support & comfort our spirits in these trying hours. Look that way, my beloved friend; & let thy dependence be there: so shall these momentary afflictions work the end for which with unerring Wisdom they have been sent, even to reduce & refine thee as pure & beaten gold, to fit thee for more fully coming up in thy several duties in this life, & prepare thee for a state of unmixed felicity in the next. In seasons of this sort, domestick troubles; kind friends & courteous neighbours are apt rather to overload with their visits, they mean to help, but they sometimes hurt by detaching the mind from a silent, solid waiting for the springing up of the well of true consolation. Most other people, & many of our own are Strangers to the efficacious virtue which proceedeth from him, the hem of whose garment we should industriously press through the crowd that we may touch with a lovely Faith, & witness thereby a Renewal of our Spiritual strength - But as we become weary of such miserable comforters, & retire to the Beloved of Souls, pouring out our prayers & tears before him, that he may be pleased to continue us & ours in his holy keeping & disposal, that he may correct us, but with his Judgments & not in anger, lest he bring us to nothing; then he is pleased to speak Peace unto us, & we see that it is in mercy & in perfect Wisdom that we are thus tried & proved: so can bless his name, who gives & who takes away at his pleasure, & a humble, dutiful acquiescence with his will possesses our souls. May this be, & I have no doubt but this has been thy experience, My dear Cousin; & I rejoice in the belief that as thou becomes more & more sequestered, separated, dedicated, thou wilt more & more feel of that substantial, Everlasting Good which is superiour to every possible calamity, whether publick or domestick. In the fresh sense of cordial amity replenishing my heart with endeared love to thee & thine I dearly salute you, thy father & brother James & bid you affectionately Farewell.
	We are (through favour of Providence) in usual health - my wife much bettered in her spirits, & consequently in her health by the prospect of retiring from this house. It looks as though Aby would at last be successful, & indeed if he does, I cannot but think that Right will have prevailed: which is my great & capital satisfaction in this affair. I cannot now enlarge, the post-bag being to be sealed-
We all very dearly salute you all. I expect John this week.
					I am, my dear Cousin,
								Very affectionately thine
								 	       	Richard Shackleton
