Was an assistant clerk. We were intending
and were just going off for the car
which was put up at Philip's. when old
Thomas Wakefield came up and invited
us to dinner - by us I mean Mary;
Polly, T H and I, as the others had
been invited to James Bells'. It was
too early to go so we strolled about
by the river till near two which we
concluded would be the [deletion][/deletion] dinner
hour. It would have been better had we
gone earlier for I think they were waiting
dinner on us. There was a large
party here, [deletion]because[/deletion] two tables laid out,
in separate rooms. We met the Doves
here also, they are nice girls I think
Their father James Richardson was there
also besides many other's whose names
I either dont know or forget. Second
meeting which was one of worship was
meeting which was one of workship was
held at 4 - after it we drove home
T H and I were in the gig - this time.
