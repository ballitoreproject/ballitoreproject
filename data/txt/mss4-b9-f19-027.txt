My dear Elizabeth

from Dublin, & try to write a full & true account of the
meeting, the best way I can do it is to give the a journal, we set out
on sixth day the latter end of the 4th mo. My aunt Sally Mary Davis & myself

we took anther to Blackchurch where we warm'd ourselves

airy looking room with 3 large windows in it, strongly barr'd with
iron outside she was then recovering from a very heavy attack [insertion]of inflamation[/insertion] in her
bowels, she seem'd in good spirits & one of the first things she said to me
was "well you see a prison is not such a horrible thing as people
think" I was there introduced to Jane Darley (of whom thou must
have heard, a great friend to all the prisoners & one herself) a tall
straight antiquated personage wearing a wig which must have
been in fashion when she [deletion]came[/deletion] went into the Prison about 20 years
ago, I was shewn a neat little room belonging to her & adorn'd with painting
of her own, which was taken off one corner of the apartment
belonging to [insertion]the[/insertion] gentlewomen, first day we went again after meeting

hast a long history of a short visit. I did not think 
I could remember it so well, I may now give thee
some domestic news but should first say that
I met Saml. Stephens in the street & he told
me that Jenny was very poorly not getting better
but perhaps thou had a letter thyself since that
time, Bess went to Carlow to last monthly meeting
& brought home word that Mary was near lying in
& would be glad to have her with her at that time &
so she has concluded to leave us & after Mary's
acouchment to go & live with Kitty, & we are to keep
but two servants & have fewer cows this arrangement will
no doubt please thee as it does the rest of us. Deborah

Parkinson is here at present going to spend a few days on
