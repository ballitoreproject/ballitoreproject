My dear Margaret
I received thy kind
note, & only heard to day
the name of the little boy
at Hally Mount. Norman
Samuel - & he appears a
healthy, quiet child, & his
Mother get on very well,
& is nursing: what she
never did before - Jessups
wife expects another baby,

when the last one will
be a year old, so she has
one every year.
Anne was here at
X Mass, & left on 2nd day,
we could not persuade
her to stay longer - she has
so many comforts at
Middleton. I have not
seen her look so well,
for a long time, & she was
in very good spirits. I
gave her thy message.
Frank seems getting on
very well at Buxton - It
is not as damp as at

Matlock, which always
suits him better.
Alberts eldest child is
Hilda Elizabeth.
2nd Winifred Mary.
3rd Norman Samuel.
& the last two.
Hilda Elizabeth and
Samuel Walter.
Jessups childrens names
are Jesse Mabel. and
Helen Jameson.
Mary has got home
from Waterford - she is
much better now & Her

throat was bad, while
she was there; she had
to stay in her room for
a good while.
It is very pleasant
to have her home again.
Freddy is at Fairfield
again & here this evening.
The weather is so cold
it is a blessing to feel
even pretty well Perhaps
when it gets brighter you
will both feel better.
Anna & Emma unite
with me in dear love.
Thy affet sister.
E S Davis.

We are reading
a book entitled
"The Priest."
We have been
told it was
written by thy
sister, It is very
interesting.
