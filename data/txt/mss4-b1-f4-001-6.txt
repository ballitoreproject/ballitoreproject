This place is very agreeable; rendered still more so by the little
prattling babes, among whom I walk about, like a sort of a Patriarch,
153
while they call me "granfaddy," and present me with their little
offerings. Yet still home, and the dearest of all earthly objects attracts
me home. I hope thy mother is satisfied with my stay, and that
you all exert yourselves to make her comfortable, and my absence tolerable
to her. She deserves every mark of duty, affection, respect, & attention
from you. She also wants your assistance, and the defects of memory
and recollection, and depredations of time, to be supplied and made
up by your more youthful activity. *** The good dispositions of
my children are the joy of my heart, and weigh it down with humble
gratitude. The prospect which opens for my dear Debby is
indeed highly pleasing and comfortable to me, as I have a peculiar
regard for the young man, whom she has no cause to be
ashamed to tell the people she designs to marry. It is also
my long settled belief, that, if kind Providence grants this my dear
child health, she will be a very loving valuable wife - a meet help
in every respect, both civil and religious. So that Thomas Chandlee
will I hope, be happy, as I really think he deserves to be in
domestic life. **
