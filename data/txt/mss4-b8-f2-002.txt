Dublin, 14th May 1823
Dear Elizabeth
I ought to apologize for
this mode of addressing you, as too presumptuous,
but any other is so formal. I am much obliged
to you for the "extracts" which you enclosed - lest
you should suspect what I would say of them
to be flattery, I will be silent - but if the
Reflector had [deletion][/deletion] such correspondents, it would
be very different from what it has been. You may
be sure I will not let it drop, so far as my
influence can effect. I am also obliged to you
for your wish to see me in Ballitore; as what
we remember to have seen with pleasure, we generally
like to see again, [deletion][/deletion] my own inclination would lead
me to yield to your wish, but it is so difficult
to leave home without either leaving undone what
should be done, or getting others [insertion]to[/insertion] do them, that I
fear I shall not be able to gratify myself in this

particular.
I most willingly forgive for "the rudeness"
which you blame yourself for; but are you not
judging yourself too harshly? [insertion]will it[/insertion] [deletion][/deletion] relieve you
if I tell you that I never before suspected the
least degree of rudeness in your behavior towards
me. & so you see I have no merit in forgiving you.
Are you aware of [deletion][/deletion] [insertion]the[/insertion] compliment which you
pay me when you say you were deceived in thinking
me, "a youth of talent but vain & contemptuous, scorning
women &c." - what! you think I have no talents
& you tell me so too! - that's the unkindest cut of
all, oh fie! - how can you think I can ever
bear it - But perhaps you are right, & please
me most when you consider me as having to be
told of my deficiencies. if so, I thank you for it.
I shall be even with you.
With respect to Sir J. Reynolds, you may keep it
till you finish it & welcome: I am [insertion]in[/insertion] no great hurry
for it. It is needless to tell you after this that
John received your packet, I got a glimpse
of the country on 1st day last at the Glen & never
seen it look more delicious
yours truly
R Barrington
