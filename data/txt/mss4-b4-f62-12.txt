My dear sister,
in not sending thee a line before now. The kind young
men who accompanied me to Mt.mellick, & acted their
parts well by me, could inform thee that we got on
agreeably & well thither. I did not get to bid R: T
farewell, please to remember me to him; & say, with
my dear love to brother, that I am obliged by his
very agreeable conveyance, – did the Cab: get home safe?
You would hear of our meeting, not [underline]overstock'd[/underline], &
you would hear of our meeting, not [underline]overstock'd[/underline], &
surely you would hear of our very precious James,
Oh that evil may never betide him saith my spirit.
I there met my own dear people, sister Chandlee received
me kindly, but we said nothing about [underline]writing[/underline],
Debby seems in good spirits, & talks of being
in Dublin next week: – we staid in Mt.mellick
second-day about Prov: school-business, – the children
looked sweet & happy. – And dear little Elizabeth
is grown a brave, smart, laughing lass, dribbling a
deal: – how goes on bonny Thomas? What a thing
The Retreat: 21/4 mo: 1792.
I think myself remiss (as I often do)
it

it is, that we must be deprived of thy company
in Dublin, well maybe [underline]this[/underline] is nearly over. Nancy
Gatchell has a bad cough, & continues at times to
throw up some blood, yet looks wonderfully well
for her to do: – she enquired kindly for thee, & I
remembered thee to her. Yesterday was our monthly
meeting, where several of us met who had been
rambling, & had been witness to many scenes in
rambling, & had been witnesses to many scenes in
our short seperation. John & Sally Watson seemed
bravely, James & John & Betsy Lecky gone to Cork.
My father's eyes poorly, – my mother midling, the
rest of us bravely I believe. – Richd. looks well &
pleasant, I fancy the stockings fit him, the thickset
I suppose will make him a full suit, which I
expect he will have on to receive his father.
As usual I am a little flat, so expect that
my beloved sister will, as usual also, put up
with, & excuse her very affectionate
S: Shackleton.

My dear Peggy,
& therefore salute thee with a few lines expressive of my near affectionate remembrance
of thee. Thou may be sure we are glad to have Sally home to us, though
home may not be much of a resting place to some of us. Our ancients were many
of them strangers to their outward homes – prisons were their dwelling-places often.
Yet whether at home or abroad, they grew in the root of divine life, & in a capacity
to serve the cause of Christianity - which in my way of thinking is what is
best worth living for – Thy present circumstances, my dear child, will I suppose
confine thee a while within a more limited sphere of action – may
this confinement, permitted in the ordering of Infinite Wisdom, be productive
of the most desirable consequences to thee – may thy spirit be so cultivated,
meliorated & impregnated with heavenly regard & favour; that it may prove
a time of accumulating spiritual knowledge & strength, against Life [unclear][/unclear]
[unclear][/unclear] going forth, against the day of hearing the sound of the trumpets
the alarm of war! The Lord has given the word – & very dreadful would it be
to be careless, or unfaithul in the publishing of it. One trained, tried servant
is dismiss'd to receive his glorious penny – another standard-bearer bearer fainteth,
& the host is discomfite[deletion]th[/deletion][insertion]ed[/insertion] – the armies of the aliens are set in array – & treachery
& falsehood & the accursed thing is in the camp of our Israel. - What
will become of the Cause, which Christ our Saviour was sent to plant & propagate
upon earth, & which, after suffering inexpressible agonies in body & in spirit,
he sealed with his blood? Of what profit will it have been to mankind,
that the blood of the holy martyrs (called the seed of the church) has been shed in
different ages of the world – & that our predecessors, raised up in the last century,
I am loath to let this page (this leaf of the table) go uncover'd,

to be as lights to the world, & the salt of the earth, so nobly stood their
ground against the corruptions & abominations of degraded, polluted Christianity,
if there be not a succession of testimony-bearers to the Truth as it is in Jesus – & if
those, who have been honour'd with a commission in his Name, will not faithfully
& diligently exercise & occupy, for their Master's use, the gifts & talents entrusted
to them? I hope better things than such depravity & disloyalty, from many
of the youth of the present day, who by their good example ("Come & see my zeal for
"the Lord") will be incentives to one another in the way of righteousness & true holiness.
All our dear love attends you all. My precious Peggy, [underline]farewell[/underline].
