Carlow 11 mo 28th. 1810
Dear Mary
I recd thy note, but cannot acct
for Ed Lees's charging thee more than 20/
for the years mags — My father paid [unclear][/unclear]
Hancock but 20/ for his years supply thro'
the post office I understood that was to be
the established rate for all others, some
of your Northern correspondents may be
able to unravel this mystery. I have
scarcely looked into the notes, as I expect
to see them in print, perhaps when I shall
have more leisure. [deletion]If the[/deletion] I have
to ask a favour of thee, which I fear
may appear too great a trespass on thy

thy goodness — vizt — I want a loan
of Hayley's life of Cowper, to lend
to a lady of my acquaintance, who
asked me for it, & not being able
to supply her, I promised to enquire
for it, but did not give her much
hopes of succeeding, so that if [insertion]it[/insertion] be at
all inconvenient or [underline]improper[/underline] do not
comply; — but if consistent with
convenience & propriety, it will
confer an additional obligation
on a young friend who hopes to enjoy
that title long.
thine &c
