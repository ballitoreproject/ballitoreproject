I know it is the fashion with many, who do not mean to send their
sons to universities, to explode and decry Latin as an useless acquisition:
it may, perhaps be unprofitable in this sense, that it may bring
them in no money; the concerns of civil life may be transacted quite
as well without it; the finest productions in that language are translated
into the mother tongue. French is more essential to accomplish
the Gentleman, to accommodate the travelere, and is the most universal
vehicle of verbal communication; but Latin has been for ages past,
and I believe will be for ages to come; (if the world stand,) the
ground-work for the literary part of liberal education. It is
like the root of all the most refined living languages; and when
a foundation is laid in this, the rest is readily learned. In our
own tongue so many thousand words branch out from the
Latin; so many Latin words are adopted into our language,
and become a part of it; and so many familiar Latin phrases
and expressions are constantly used in speaking and writing,
that an ignorance of Latin leaves us much in the dark, and,
like bad spelling, betrays an original defect in one's tuition.
