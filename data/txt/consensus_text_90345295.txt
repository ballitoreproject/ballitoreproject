1st..
Papa went to town this morning.
1st
Gardened a little, and after tea
accompanied Avy & Liddy on a fishing
expedition to the river which however
unfortunately proved unsuccesful not
even [underline]one[/underline] trout -
2nd.. Papa came out this morning and intends
going with Mama Uncle Francis and Aunt
Lucy to Killarney to-morrow. So we must be
stirring early. I had a short note from
stirring early. I had a shock not from
[extra line]
Ned ere yesterday the first since he went. Papa
had another more lengthy one. Poor Willie
also wrote lately, says he has been very ill
and is very thin. At Cincinnatti still.
I had intended going this evening to
spend a few days with Georgina, but must
defer my visit to a more suitable time.
3rd.. Well Papa and Mama went in early
and I hope they may have a pleasant
journey. I was busy all day nearly mending,
and it's not finished yet alas!
