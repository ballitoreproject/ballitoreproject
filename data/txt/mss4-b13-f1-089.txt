87 for Liverpool, reached Warrington got to John & Elizth. Bludwickâ€™s just as they were about setting out for Liverpool, to be at their select meeting previous to their monthly meeting, to be held on third-day. We went another stage in our chair, & then about eight miles from Liverpool got a carriage, & our guide (Edward Bellows) coming with me in the chair, M:D & J:G led the way, & we soon got here, to the house of our dear friends Robt. & S: Benson they were in affliction, having that very morning lost a truly valuable & beloved sister in Elizth. Rathbone, she had been long in a decline, & now has happily got to a place of everlasting rest. We were not in time to this select meeting third-day, & saw several dear friends, Martah Routh & John Thorp not the least beloved, & my ears were gratified much by hearing dear J:T preach; - how did my precious father admire & love him
