Dublin 19th Apr 1821
Dear Eliza
I write to you at last in answer to
your two acceptable favours.- Since I received your's I was
near halfway to Balitore, being fishing with my father beyond
Blessington on Sunday and Monday the 8th and 9th Inst. we had
wet weather part of the time, but when it was fine the mountains
and hills looked delightful; I was in part of the Co Wicklow I was
never in before, where I think the clouds and sun have a greater
effect than any place I know. When the sun would [deletion][/deletion] break
out through the clouds the tops of the mountains being covered with
mist, you might imagine them a great deal higher than they
really are and the sun shining on some of them and others
being in the shade had a great effect. The sun setting over
some low hills, illuminated the opposite mountains with
almost a rose colour.
When we came home we heard that E and D Shackleton and
S Leadbeater were in town, they dined with us the Sunday
following. E does not look much the worse for his sickness
 but D. looks very poorly.
J Stephens has been very ill this sometime back, the Doctor said
 on Sunday last that he had not much hopes of him, but since
that he has got rather better You have heard I suppose that the
large house at G.- is sett for 3 years to a [unclear]Mr Deery[/unclear] and we are
to be in the cottage in the Glen, it is fitted up very snugg I heard

Edward says he never spent a more pleasant evening, than
he did there the Sunday my father and I were away; do you
remember the day you slept on the sofa there.
The writer of that article in the Ballitore Magazine, described
the state of his mind as being affected, after reading the late
popular novels, in a very different manner from what mine was,
instead of my mind turning with disgust from the common occurrences
of life, I have had a greater [deletion]pleasure[/deletion] relish for enjoying the
pleasures that we receive, [deletion]from[/deletion] both from the bea[insertion]u[/insertion]ties of nature, and
from the observation of men and manners, in short the effect they
have on me, is more like the effect he says the Tatler Spectator &c
have on him. The effect of these novels a great deal depends
on the manner in which you read them, a hasty perusal
will have a greater tendency to give the effect he mentions than
when you only take them up as a relaxation from business or
study; it depends also in a great measure on the state of your
mind at the time, the writer of that article seems to me to have
had his mind curiously affected by some cause or another,
when he mentions the stings of remorse and the rapid feelings
he experiences when he arrives at the last page. For my part
I think the effect produced by [deletion][/deletion] reading those books, which they
say have a bad tendency, depends a great deal more on the state
of the person's mind and the views he takes of them, than on the
books themselves, for how differently will the same book affect

individuals. If the person's mind is sufficiently exercised by self
instruction, it will not receive those bad impressions, but take up
whatever is good and leave out the bad.
I have read the No of the mirror which you mention, and I say
once and for all that [insertion]to[/insertion] those people who take the opinions of Authors without
considering whether they are right or not, there are many immoral
books, but I do not think any person should be governed even by the
greatest authors in matters of opinion. There is a great deal
to be said both for and against Lord Chesterfield, but I do not
think so bad of him and most people do; the dissimal action which
he recommends, is practised in a more or less degree by all people
who have to lead a public life, even Richardson could not draw
his perfect character without making him practise it in some
in[unclear][/unclear].
[unclear][/unclear]ing all this, I think you must have a [unclear][/unclear]
time of it writing to all your correspondents
I send this by an acceptable messenger I guess -
I remain yours
John
Richard will tell you all the domestick occurences
