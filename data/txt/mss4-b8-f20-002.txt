of the Soul to a principle which it had lost in its corrupt and fallen state.
Mankind have opposed this doctrine, because it has a direct tendency to
lay very low the pride and elevation of the heart, and the perverseness of the
will, and prescribes a severe mortification to the passions; it will be found,
notwithstanding, either in time or eternity, a most important truth.
In the Holy Scriptures nothing appears to have a reference to the great
work of salvation, but a rectitude of the heart, and subjection of the will;
and it is clear to my understanding that it should be so; for the mere operations
of the head, the lucubrations of reason on divine subjects, are so different
as men. The natural powers of man may be sanctified by the influences
of religion in the soul, and cease from opposition in matters wherein formerly
they took supreme direction; but until they are in awful silence before God,
the work if redemption is unfelt and unknown.
Religion is an universal concern; the only important business of our
lives. The learned and the ignorant are equally the subject of it; and it is
highly becoming the Father of Spirits, the friend of man, that all the Spirits
which He had made, should be equal candidates for his regard, that his mercy
should operate upon a principle, of which mankind are equal partakers.
If the reason or the understanding were alone capable of religious discernment,
nine tenths of the world would be excluded from his providence;
but not so does his mercy operate. He influences by love, and the affections
are the only objects of it.
Look into the opinions of men, contemplate their great diversity,
their complete opposition to each other; and where shall the serious
reflecting mind find a peaceful station to rest upon? where shall
it find the shadow of a mighty rock in a weary land? of fluctuating
devices and tempests of opinion? [underline]Not in human literature[/underline], not in
[underline]the inventions of men[/underline]; but [underline]in silence before the God of our Lives, in pure[/underline]
[underline]devotion of the Heart, and in prostration of the Soul! The knee bends before[/underline]
[underline]the majesty of Omnipotence, and all the powers of the mind say, Amen![/underline]
In matters so important as[underline] pure Religion[/underline], the salvation of the immortal Soul,
it is highly worthy of Divine Wisdom that He should take the supreme direction
to Himself alone, and not leave any part of the work to the [underline]device of[/underline]
[underline]man[/underline]; for it is evident to every candid enquirer, that [underline]whenever he interferes[/underline]
[underline]he spoils it. * Religion is of so pure and spotless a nature, that a touch will[/underline]
[underline]contaminate it.[/underline] It is uniform, consistent, and of the same complexion
and character in all nations. Languages and customs may greatly differ,
but the language of pure devotion of the Heart to its Maker is one and the
same over the face of the whole earth. It is acknowledged and felt -
through the unity of the spirit, in the bond of peace? There is a harmony and
and
Phil. ii, 13. " For it is God which worketh in you, both to will and to do, of his good pleasure.'
The talk of Religion, [underline]the Christian Religion[/underline], being [underline]established by Law, the "Laws of men, [/underline]
is not only presumptuous, but vain and nugatory- - [underline]and idle pretence![/underline] True and genuine;
unsophisticated, [underline]Christian Religion[/underline], agreeable to the sentiments of this enlightened
virtuous damsel, is [underline]one, invariable, unchangeable[/underline]; but those pretended, otherwise
arbitrary, forced [underline]establishments [/underline]- force upon conscience, however plausible - are [underline]many[/underline]
[underline]various[/underline], and [underline]contradictory[/underline].

and [deletion]and[/deletion] consistency in the works of God, external and internal; tho external
operations of nature are strictly typical of internal things; the visible of
the invisible world.
I am convinced that the Author of our being has left nothing to man, with
respect to the formation of Religion in the mind of a child, but the opening
his path, and clearing his road from the thorns and branches of contagious
example. The influences of man consist in pure example, dispassionate
persuasion, and an early subjection of the will to what is written in
the Law of God.* The enlightening the understanding, the purification of
the heart, the accomplishing the course of rectitude to the invisible world, and
qualifying the soul for beatitude amongst the spirits of the just, must be left
to Supreme wisdom and mercy. [underline]The sciences[/underline] are of very partial concern,
are in the hands of a few, and are the proper objects of human wisdom, and
attainable by its power alone; but their centre and their circumscription is in
time. [underline]From high attainments in these the mind of man is taught to wonder,[/underline]
[underline]but I much question whether he is often taught to adore.[/underline] They are too apt to
raise the mind, to engage a devoted idolatrous attention; and fix a supercilious
disregard to the humble appearance of a meek and quiet spirit, and if
it were possible that they should accompany the soul from time to eternity.
they would prove a subject of humiliation before an eye that is more expressively
opened; yet these may be sanctified by the influence of Religion.
"The Editor" is not sure that the above reflections were originally hers - if a
translation - [underline]they are perfectly in unison with her ideas[/underline] in as to this
we cannot doubt her ideas were just and clear. I shall here add a letter,
and some verses [insertion]as hinted[/insertion], addressed by Thomas Williamson to her Mother; which are
thus introduced - "The Author, Thomas Wilkinson, a Quaker, is

" My dear Friend,
Will it be an intrusion on the sacredness of thy sorrow

" therein. I have awoke in tears in the night to meditate on the affecting

"companions by day. Many are now my recollections of dear Elizabeth; her
sweet and serious countenance is often so vivid in my remembrances, that
"I sometimes can hardly think I shall see her no more. How unsearchable
"are the ways of the Almighty! He frequently selects the wisest and the
"best for Himself, whilst "the world lying in wickedness," seems to want their
example and and reproof, and the virtuous and drooping Christian their encouragement

"they are in wisdom, though that wisdom we cannot comprehend. Never let us

The Memorial -
"How dark this river murmuring on its way;
This wood how solemn, at the close of day!
What clouds come on, what shades of evening fall.
Till one vast veil of sadness covers all: -
Then why alone, thus lingering do I roam.
Heedless of clouds, of darkness, and of home?-
Well may I linger in this twilight gloom
Alone, and sad - Eliza's in her tomb!
She who so late, by kindred taste ally'd,
Paced this lone path, conversing at my side,
The wildering path 'twas her delight to prove,
Through the green valley or the cooling grove.
"Can I forget, on many a summer's day,
How through the woods and lanes we wont to stray;
How cross the moors and up the hills to wind
And leave the fields and sinking vales behind:
How arduous o'er the mountain steeps to go,
And look by turns on all the plains below;
How scal'd th' aerial cliffs th'adven'trous maid,
Whilst, far beneath, her foil'd companion staid?
"Yet whilst to her sublimest scenes arise,
Of mountains pil'd on mountains to the skies,
The intellectual world still claim'd her care,-
There she would range, amid the wise and fair,
Untutor'd range: - her penetrating mind
Left the dull track of school research behind;
Rush'd on, and seiz'd the funds of Eastern lore,
Arabia, Persia, adding to her store.
"Yet unobtrusive, serious and meek,
The first to listen, and the last to speak;
Though rich in intellect, her powers of thought
In youth's prime season no distinction sought;
But ever prompt at [underline]duty's[/underline] sacred call,
She oft in silence left the social hall,
To trace the cots and villages around,
No cot too mean, where misery might be found:
Now have I seen her at the humblest shed,
Bearing refreshment to the sick man's bed;
His drooping spirits cheer'd - she from his door
Return'd, amid the blessings of the poor!
"Oh, lost [underline]Eliza[/underline]! dear ingenuous maid,
While low in earth thy cold remains are laid
Thy genuine friendship, thy attentions kind,
Rise like a vision on my pensive mind;
Thy love of truth, thy rediness to please,
Thy sweet, refin'd simplicity and ease,
Enhanc'd the favours of ingenious art,
And made thy gifts pass onward to the heart:
These beauteous tints,*- These peaceful scenes I view,
Thy taste design'd, and ready friendship drew;
Long shall my care the sweet memorials save -
The hand that traced them rests within the grave;
"Lamented Maiden! pensive and alone,
While sorrowing friendship pours her tender moan
Sad memory sees thee, at our parting hour,
Pale, weak, yet lovely as a drooping flower
Which sheds its leaves on autumn's sickly bed;-
Thou from thy pillow raised thy peaceful head,
To me thou held'st thy feeble hand - it bore
Naambanna + dying on his native shore:
Like his, Religion's holy truths, address'd
To thy young mind, were treasur'd in thy breast;
Like his, we saw thy early blossoms wave;
Now see the virtues weeping o'er thy grave."

Had these verses been mere poetic fiction, and, with the prose, not founded
in fact, I should scarcely have considered either time or paper well occupied;
they have indeed taken up rather more of both [insertion]in coppying[/insertion] than I expected; but not unpleasantly,
nor yet altogether unprofitably, I trust, however the perusal may
prove to you: If they happen not to be new, they will nevertheless be accepted
kindly, as intended, I cannot doubt; they will be as [unclear]twice[/unclear] reading, and
they may serve, with you, a little "to stir up the the pure mind by way of
remembrance" - as they have done with me: if not flowery they are
chaste at least, not indulging poetical licence; of the beauties of Poetry I do
not consider myself qualified to judge; some argue that fable and fiction
are indispensable requisites; I think not; this however is certain, that, if
the introduction of [underline]Heathen names and customs[/underline] was forbidden, unlawful,
to the Jews, formerly, [underline]they must be more so[/underline] to Christians, now, in this
more enlightened dispensation: "Make no mention of the names of
"other Gods, neither let it be heard out of thy mouth." Exod Xxiii, 13. [underline]A pure[/underline]
[underline]language is required. -[/underline]
Query. Would not Line 14 stand better thus? Through woods and Lawns how wont we were to stray,
And Line 50 - for ready friendship - ready pencil - see.g friendship is intro-
so soon after, in Line 34, and stands well there?

Should the following Lines be new to you, though without a name,
I expect you will as readily assign them to their author as the old
anonymous Letter, on the first sheet, which I think you can not be at a
loss for - Viz.
Of a cottage all peaceful, I sing;
Not far off is a beautiful spring; -
On the streamlet the water-cress grows;
In the hedges sweet brier, wild rose;
On the banks, herbs to season the pot
When it boileth, inside of the cot;
Which is furnish'd enough and to spare;
[underline]Even[/underline] now, for a prophet - if there,
With a servant, to lessen his care:
His son, too, a farmer, hard by, -
Of produce oft sends a supply:
Like the father - [underline]bereft of his mate[/underline]!..
May [underline]peace[/underline] be his blessed estate; .....
In submission to [underline]Heaven[/underline]* - not [underline]Fate[/underline]!
In my last communication I gave account of some of your Friends in
London: - doubtless you still have many there; and frequent intercourse;
but I now seldom go there; and have seen few of them lately: indeed I am
become feeble, my strength and spirits will not bear me through fatigue as
formerly - when at Ballitore, between 30 and 40 years ago - I never was
[underline]robust[/underline] or [underline]strong[/underline]: - but I do not murmur; I think I am contented with
my allotment, I am sure I [underline]ought[/underline] so to be - I have been in Town
once only, since last Yearly Meeting; and then stopt very little; going
purposely to see some beloved relatives and Friends, not well;
my Cousin, the Widow Tabitha Bevans - Cousins Wilson and Grizell Birkbeck -
Joseph Gurney Bevan and his Wife, particularly: Cousin Joseph's
sight fails him; one eye is quite dark; and in other respects he is enfeebled
not mentally I trust - though he [insertion]hath[/insertion] long exerted and applied great and good
abilities to good, yea the best purposes I believe; Dear Mary, his valued
partner, also, is much reduced - I fear not likely to survive long - having
had frequent [insertion]alarming[/insertion] attacks [insertion]of late[/insertion] not easy to describe, but I suppose epileptick
rather than paralytical: When ever removed, or taken from us , doubtless
it will be [insertion]to them a blessed[/insertion] exchange, in mercy and wisdom - from works to rewards: And I
have comfort in believing that, notwithstanding the low state of things,
- in a society capacity I mean - they have, and will leave behind them,
a few faithful fellow-labourers in the Vineyard: a due succession of
such, bound to the good cause; can never fail; [underline]Truth will triumph[/underline]!
I have paid the Dudley family a visit since they came to Southwark;
they were well, and seem to be comfortably settled; Abigail Pim
spent the afternoon with us; her valued Mother continues to be as
comfortable and cheerful, in her confined, debilitated state as can be
expected: John and his family were well. I am obliged by the particular
detail you have given me of yours; and shall attempt some description
of
*To the order of [underline]Providence[/underline]
which is over all, in best wisdom;
not [underline]Destiny[/underline], or [underline]Fate[/underline]; as by some
defined or supposed.
