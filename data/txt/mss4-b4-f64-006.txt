My dear aunt
Having heard of a favourable opportunity,
tho' it is only to Carlow, I thought I
would take advantage of it, and write a few lines
to thee, it was contrary to my intentions that I
remained so long in thy debt but I could not
well avoid it.
I heard from home last night by the
beer man, had I known of his going I would have
written to thee by him: my mother sent me
two very pretty verses, Joshua and Mary, and Jenny's
funeral, they are greatly admired.
Mary Greer told me thou spent a few
days at Hall to their satisfaction there, and
that her uncle shewed thee his verses.

I hope to see you at the Carlow meeting,
as my going there is left to Governess' decision,
and I flatter myself that decision will be favourable
to my wishes.
We had very unpleasant weather here
for a long time, mostly wet, some snow, and a
little frost. Samuel Penrose junr., who came here
yesterday, says they [deletion]have[/deletion] had fine weather in
Munster while it was so wet here: he is to
come soon again and take away Mary, so she will
go at last without going to Ballitore.
Did you see or hear any thing of a comet
which appear'd a few weeks ago? It was observed by
some of the girls who spoke to Master Mullin about
it, he shewed us its position on the celestial globe,
it makes considerable progress towards the South
East, and is in the constellation Serpentarius
moving fast to Lyra perhaps if you look for it
it will not be too late to find it; about a

week ago Mary Penrose and some one else saw a
large ball of fire in [insertion]the[/insertion] heavens they called the girls
to see it, but I was not at home so missed the
sight, it illuminated the yard and seemed to
fly thro' the air, it fell about a mile from
the town, but I have not heard that it did any
mischief, it was thought at first to be a meteor.
Governess says she thinks [underline]we[/underline] are deserving of
the honour of [deletion]the[/deletion] discovering the comet, and is
not that very clever? she desires me to say with
her love that she received thy letter which was acceptable.
I am obliged to thee for the bit of hair Twas
very glad to get it.
With dear love to all the family and
any one else thou chooses I conclude thy affte niece
I hazarded writing to Eben and am sorry for it ever since
as he is silent
Elizth Leadbeater

Please tell my mother I would be much obliged to her
if she would get me four little pictures or maps to put
on a set of hand screens which I am making for a very
nice person no matter who I would not like drawings
but if she have any [insertion]prints[/insertion] cut out [deletion]for her fire side[/deletion] and that she
could spare I doubt not but they would do. M Haughton
sends her dear love to you all.

Ballitore
[unclear]Och[/unclear] such a sweet Inn myself ne'er saw before,
as the Quaker Leadbeater's at neat Ballitore,
And whenever I pass the same road till he's dead,
I'll always set up with the Beater of Lead.
