August 22 - 1864
My very dear Eliza
I feel thankful
that you have been able to bear
the awful operation which it must
have been to get the spot on your
face burned & trust sincerely that
it may be the means of completely
curing you - yesterday being Sunday
(our entire party consisting only of
Lucy & Arthur besides ourselves)
We were wishing very much we
could be sure that you still continued
getting on well - Mamma
Lucy & Emily are now out driving

& I have not seen any of them
to-day but they are all well your
Mother just as usual, but when
she happens to think about [underline]you[/underline]
she generally begins to cry,
however it is only [underline]sometimes[/underline]
she seems rightly to understand
about it, but she seems [underline]always[/underline]
to understand that you are
away from her - I sould have
written to you sooner but that
I had my sister Susan here
with me all last week & you
know, I am not able for a great
deal at present. I had the house
people with me while Susan was
here, to meet Mrs Gamble, but poor
Lucy was too bad with headache
 to come, however Francis [underline]did[/underline] come
& Mamma seemed finely -
My sister Mary & her family
are finely, the Baby that is left
is thriving nicely, Kate was poorly
for a while, after the death of
the other - there has not been
a letter from Lizzie since she
went to her own house, but a
very pleasant one telling of her
travels [insertion]while on a visit at Bennetts[/insertion] of course she is very happy
& God grant that it may continue

Evening - Emily has just called
& read me a letter received from
you to-day it is delightful to
hear that you are still going on
well, she is writing a few lines
to enclose in this & then she
can write you a longer letter in
a day or so - & now my dear
Eliza I must say good bye hoping
we may soon be expecting you
home better & happier for your visit
to Paris & believe me your much
attached friend & sister

P.S. I dont know how to write with a
steel pen - as the first part is -
Dear love to Thomas
