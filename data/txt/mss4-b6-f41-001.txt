Dublin 22d January 1817 -
Had I an opportunity I should have
sent you the Almanack before now however
as a friend of mine promises to forward this
free of Postage I embrace the opportunity and
with it send the Almanack. I indeed feel
much pleasure in acquainting you that your
Mother is much better. and even so well
as to be up to Breakfast every Morning.
She desires me to make her Most Affectionate
Regards to you and her best wishes to
all with you she is a good woman &

and feels pleasure in that which makes every
one happy. Pat is as usual well and Merry
and he with not less feeling joins your
Mother in her first hopes ([underline]you[/underline]): he gave
us all a very pleasing account of the
Jaunting Car you went in to the Country
I trust your journey was agreeable and
free from the bad weather. had you
any friendly passengers with you: I am
sure you will be happy to hear the
difference between me & Captain [unclear]Ba[/unclear]
is acquitted amicably. he with all the
goodness of his heart desires his friendly
Regards for your future happiness in

which he is joined by myself I
trust the Almanack will be both
useful & entertaining tho' a small
present from
John OMalley
P.S. Your Mother desires me to inform
you that the private promise she
Made you shall be fulfilled. and you
May expect it when ever the first
Messenger comes to Town from you
& that you tell them to receive it
but first write who' the person is.

and
Tell W Jas Nowlan from me that
I trust he will be as happy as his
best friends can wish him,
and that I would name him before
but I really assure him it was not
from want of friendship
