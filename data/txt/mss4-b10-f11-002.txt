My dear John
I suppose you thought
that I did not intend writing
to you any more, but I wanted
to wait until I had something
to say. Did you read many of the
Athenian letters. I think the 2nd
Volume is the most interesting.
I like the travels of Anacharsis
better. We have [insertion]had[/insertion] very stormy weather
here these two or three days,
some of the trees are changeing
a good deal. I have not begun
to learn Italian yet. I would

be very glad of, when you see
any th[insertion]i[/insertion]ng wrong in my behaviour
or manners that you would
tell [insertion]me[/insertion] of it, as Burn's says
"Oh if some power the gift to gie us,
To see ourselves as other's see us."
Do you intend to go to Luggelaw
I was in hopes that we would
have gone up this summer
but I suppose we wont go now,
Halloween will soon be here
how the time fly over, I am
afraid that I shall be sorry
when I grow up that I did
not learn more, when I had an
opportunity, but I think that
I learned a good many things
since Mr Reightly came. I
like him a great deal better
than I did, he seems more free
and entertaining, which do you
think history or, letters, are
the most improving, I like
both, but I think I like
history best, I wonder how
Sir William Jones learned
all the languages he knew
I hope you will write me
a long letter, so I remain
yours
Emily
write soon
If you see bad grammar [insertion]or spelling[/insertion] tell me
