dined again at Deborah Moline's: & found Thos..
Scattergood at John Bevens: it was truly comfortable
to see him a little revived & holding
up his head again in hope:- I thought I
felt thankful therefore, &, strange to tell, in
the midst of their conversation ventured to
express my feelings,- my dear companion
added her testimony,- and encouraged our
valuable host joining Thos.. in a journey he
has in prospect, (Thos.. much desiring his company:)
before we separated T:S poured forth
feeling supplication; & then left us for Tottenham,
whither he went with S: Dillwyn,
intending to set out in the morning. 15th..
