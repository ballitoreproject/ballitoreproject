Dear Molly
I was much obliged to thee for giving me so
particular an account of health &c as thy letter
conveyed, which, however, I thought long in coming;
Cousin Thomas Bewley did oblige us in calling to let
us know that William was better, but he then being
still in [insertion][underline]confined to[/underline][/insertion] bed, left the matter dubious how it might turn.
my Husband was earnest to get home, & I looked on it
that our stay would increase trouble in the family, already
in-commoded with sickness, so was willing to come,
to have much pains taken to entertain us, is not
the way to make the entertainment agreeable to us, the
more simple & apparently easy that matter is, the more
agreeable; I think there is often too much ado made
about the entertainment of friends - I have been dissatisfied
with & under it -
My Husband has been rather poorly of late, the
easterly Wind incommodes his breathing, so we do not
go to the Meeting at Mt.rath, where I expected to have
seen some of you, & hear how the Friends get forward
in the North. He joins me in dear Love to you all & farewell
E Pike
