My dear Mother,
Last night I received a letter from our dear
Sally, in which she expressed a desire I should let you
know that. "After some hours of very sore conflict of mind
"I received joyful intelligence thro' dear Hannah Davis, of
"dear Lydia having again got over the time of great trial,
"tell them how much this news has relieved me on her
"account; if I could but now hear some agreeable intelligence of our dear mother.
"of our dear Mother, I would in that respect be comfortable,
"do tell them in Ballitore to direct to Thomas
Piutters for me." Thus dear Sally writes: she has her
troubles , [deletion]tis[/deletion][insertion]this World is[/insertion] a thorny Wilderness for us all to pass thro', but
more especially for such as [insertion]art[/insertion] called into the arduous field
of publick labour, & have not only their own burdens to
bear, but to bear burdens for others; & be baptized for the
Dead, such had need of the sympathy, & prayers of the
living Members in the body. I trust poor Sally will be
suppli'd with faith & patience, & return with the reward of

peace

peace. We have got Richard home to us a credit to
Ballitore, stout & hearty, & agreeable, he desired I would
write to his Grandmother, which I ought to do without
his desire; as I wrote to others of the family I thought
it much the same, & I am grown exceedingly lazy in
about writing, my attention being so engrossed with house
keeping, & nursing that I muddle over one day after another,
without having much account to give of my time,
poor Thomas has turned out such a weakly, sickly
child, that he [insertion]is[/insertion] worse to me than all the rest, I take him
out on the Car when the weather answers, he has had a
great lax, & a cough at times, is very white, & quite
poor in flesh, he gets a grain of hippo, & 4 drops of
 laudanum at night by Doctor Harris's directions,
sometimes his hand are hot, & he is quite peevish lying
on Nancy's shoulder, at other times he is a little cheerful
& cooler, I must only endeavour to take care of him
& consider his continuance as uncertain, the rest of the
children thro' favour pretty well, as is my Husband &
self. I hope dear Lydia continues [insertion]to[/insertion] recover, & the little
one

one to thrive, also that Richard is getting over his disorder
I am pleased to find sister Mary's child is so hearty, it
makes one's care comparatively light, I have had experience
of the difference, thou hast also, in Molly & Sally,
[underline]I[/underline] seem to give myself up to them, when they are sickly.
Richard had a fine care-taker in Joshua Beale, he
spent a great part of this day with us, & contributed
to cheer & edify, with his innocent, unaffected conversation.
he has I believe a sound heart, & his preservation from
every attack of the Enemy greatly to be desired, he is a
singular character to be sure, & so have many favoured
Men been in their day; but when the foundation is rightly
laid, the building is proved, by its stability.
It is pleasant to us to hear, that amidst many bodily
infirmities, thou keeps about, & that they [insertion]do[/insertion] not rapidly
encrease upon thee, which is a great favour, & what
we greatly covet may continue, for the sake of others.
We had the pleasure of enjoying some of our dear, old
& true friend E: Pike's company on her way to Cork,
she seemed kindly interested about poor little Thomas.
My Husband, Abram & Richard (Anne from home)
join in dear love to thee & the families thy affectionate M Grubb
