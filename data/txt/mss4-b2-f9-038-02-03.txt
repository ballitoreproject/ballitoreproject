Dear Cousin Abigail
	I received thine of 5th by which we have dull account of poor, dear John. +++ You do well to endeavour after resignation to that Supreme Being Will  the pang of parting with our dear children is heart-rending as it were, & the hour of death is replete with horror oftentimes, but here is not in such afflictions the sharp sting of sin & Divine pleasure. He that rules & bears sway in heaven & earth, he that gave life is demanding it again, & all that he doth is right & best. We are not, in such a situation, bitterly lamenting the evil conduct of our offspring, & dreading their eternal as well as temporal destruction. We are only giving way to the tender feelings of humanity & parental affection, & herein, if we be disciples indeed, we have the sympathy of him who wept for Lazarus.
	I know not whether I mentioned in my last the loss which his friends & the publick have sustained in W. C. of the County Kilkenny  he had been an old pupil of mine, & preserved a very grateful affection for my wife & me. From conviction in his own mind, & tender [word crossed out] conscience, he withdrew from the worlds ceremonies, lifeless forms of worship, embraced in his heart the vital, essential principle, which characterizes our religious society & forfeited (I believe) considerable emoluments by refusing to swear judicially  He ordered in his will made (I suppose) several years ago, that his remains should be interred in this place. He died after a short illness, & his friends brought his corpse to be buried here  some of us went as far as Carlow to meet the funeral: his interment was in this grave-yard, silent, solemn & attended with the heart-tendering power of Truth.
+++ Our friend Sarah Newland has had it long on her mind to pay a religious visit to the Province of Ulster. I suppose she proceeds ^on it^ pretty directly after the half-years meeting. If all be well with us, & our friends approve of it, I know not but my wife may bear her company, as my wife seems to have a freedom towards it, & we both hold Sarah & her gift in high estimation. Perhaps if no impediment should intervene, I may accompany my wifeI have never been in thy dear sisters quarter since her residence there. If it should be my lot that her house be a house of mourning when I first come under her roof, I must be content with the dispensations of Infinite Wisdom, & hope that I will ^shall^ be willing, with humble, thankful acquiescence, to mingle my tears with those of my beloved friend. +++ Believe me, my dear Abbys affectionate friend & kinsman
