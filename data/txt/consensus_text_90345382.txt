Hallow e'en
going to ride, , so we all Avy included
set off to Bray, to buy apples and some
other things. Oh it was a lovely day and
so mild, the sky the sky, the beautiful
blue sky oh how I admire you.
I dont know when there was such a clear
bright day - the mountains, trees, sea
all looked particularly beautiful.
While waiting for a cake to get ready we
drove down to the strand, saw poor old
Betty who had met with an accident
lately, a hall door having been clapped
on her hand and her little finger broken.
She said she had now nearly recovered
the effects of it and seemed very thankful
After all our waiting there was no cake ready
After all our waiting, there was no cake ready
It was nearly two when we returned,
a car at the door looked like visitors, so
we found out from Bridget that Mrs
Hancock and another young lady was
in the drawing room. She is not at
October -
