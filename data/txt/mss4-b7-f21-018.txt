You will my dear friend believe, that my silence
has not been occasioned either by a want of kindness for you,
[unclear][/unclear] from insensibility to the contents of your Letter - for your
[unclear]own[/unclear] feeling, liberal mind, will never lead you to suspect me.
[unclear]I[/unclear] have indeed only waited for a mode of conveyance -
[unclear]I[/unclear] will not attempt to tell you how completely the unexpected
[unclear]contents[/unclear] of your last letter over set me - I [underline]loved[/underline] Mary Bewley,
but indeed I was not aware how much! Assure dear Susan,
that from my very heart I sympathise, & condole with her -
[underline]She[/underline] is the object for whom I grieve - Worthy Mary's singleness
[unclear]of[/unclear] heart, & purity of mind, is I trust rewarded by a happiness
beyond our conception! - I sincerely hope poor Susan will
be comforted - Time will soften the agony of Grief, & other
[unclear]reflections[/unclear] which will arise from the amiableness of Mary's disposition,
[unclear]must[/unclear] afford comfort. I shall be anxious to know whether the
[unclear]Friend can[/unclear] be found, who will in some degree supply the loss -
The amiable Fanny has my kindest wishes for support & safety

in her expected trial, - the little Stranger will interest poor Susan,
& call off her attention from her loss, to her gain - I depend on you
for telling me when Fanny is confined - Your Society seems improving,
& I hope your security is increased - The Inn appears to be
a source of introducing pleasant characters to you; & I hope it is
as profitable, as pleasing - I have often heard of Mrs. St George, from
my friend Lady Eleanor Butler, & I have always understood she
was a Woman of uncommon talents - my retirement has been
illumined lately by the company of a Miss Hamilton, (a Country-woman
of yours) She is the author of several works, all as conspicuous
for their purity & benevolence, as for their Wit & Literary
merit - She has taken a Lodging beside one of the neighbouring
Lakes within 7 miles of us, so that she is within reach
even of a walk, & comes to partake of my Cottage fare for a day
or two - When I tell you that I have not seen a Gentlewoman
since I came to England, much less a woman of any talents,
you will suppose that Miss Hamilton is a great acquisition
to me. - [deletion][/deletion]
[deletion][/deletion]
[deletion][/deletion] she has so much of the true spirit of Christianity, that it is

impossible not to esteem her; & such extraordinary abilities, as command
respect & admiration. I know my dear Friend you kindly interest
[deletion]in[/deletion] yourself in my little comforts, & therefore I have dwelt the more
on the greatest I have had, since I wrote last. Mr S's Commission
is still unsettled, I fancy from the circumstance of the whole of
the Regmt. not being arrived in England - I know not yet whether
we [insertion]can[/insertion] continue even our present limitted plan; my little purchase
being completely out of repair in every respect, has occasion'd a
great outlay - & Hope - which is providentially the last thing which
fails us - suggests that all will be well - tho' Prudence sometimes
whispers in my ear to beware of building on sublunary
things - Pray remember me very affectionately to my [unclear][/unclear]
circle of Friends at Ballitore, they have all my sin[unclear][/unclear]
wishes - tell Abraham I shall never cease to be his [unclear]Fri[/unclear]
we are too much alike, to be good correspondents - both too irritable,
& too [underline]Bigotted[/underline] to our own opinions, to give way to each other - I hope
we shall finally, both find ourselves right! Many thanks for
your beautiful lines on the tour to Langdale pikes - I co.d not forbear
a smile at the idea of your introducing Thomas to the Scene of dis-robing
the Girls - but your pure mind had no such thoughts - by the bye,
my dear Mary, what an Irish trick were you guilty of! - a Frank'd
cover directed to me, contain'd a packet apparantly for T.W. [underline]only;[/underline] being
aware of the kindness of your heart, which I persuaded myself wd. not forget me,

Mrs Leadbeater
Ballitore
Sheffield Ireland
I began poking the inside of his letter, till I produced one for myself. [unclear]Thomas[/unclear]
is my continued amiable friend, I apply to him in all my difficulties
& he never fails me - With our kind regards for Thos. Bewley, request [unclear][/unclear]
he writes to his Brother Samuel, that he will say, if nothing can be
had of Chartres, it is repugnant to our Natures to detain him in [unclear][/unclear]
& therefore we wish him to be liberated - but shod. be obliged to Mr. S. Bewley to
inform us how the case stands. I do not hesitate to say, my Husband [unclear]dism[/unclear]
the Prison more than the Swindler, for being such a complete Dupe! - [unclear]your[/unclear]
gentle Spirit will sigh over the warmth of mine. -
Turpin desires her Duty, accept of my Love & Esteem, & believe [unclear][/unclear]
Tell the amiable Lydia, I have made a
hot bed, purposely to raise the Cucumber Seed sh
gave me - [underline]it[/underline] has disappointed me, tho [underline]She never did[/underline], I cannot prevail [unclear]on[/unclear]
to destroy the Bed, because I think it impossible anything from [underline]her[/underline] can be entirely worthless
Sincerely your[unclear] Friend[/unclear]
