		Ballitore, 18th of Twelfthmonth, 1770.
	My Dear Margaret,
		I received thine yesterday morning; it was very acceptable, as it conveyed variety of intelligence. **
91.		The capacity for writing on the best subject, I know well, is not in our power, and better not meddle with it when it does not come freely. ** Thy grandfather has been poorly for several days past. It is quite uncertain, altogether in the hand of Providence, how it will  turn out. It may be a means of his translation from earth to heaven, or it may prove a renewal of health and strength to him. I know, on hearing this, thou wilt be uneasy at being from him. But content thyself in patient resignation: if he grow worse, thou mayst be sure we shall soon send for thee. **
