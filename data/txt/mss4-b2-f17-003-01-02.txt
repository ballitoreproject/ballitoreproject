From the same to the same
My dear friend,
I look on it as a strong symptom of thy humility (& I am always glad when I see such in my beloved friends), that thou so particularly apologizes for not writing to me  or rather for not sending me a letter. Thy good-natured memory seems not to have suggested to thee that it is I who was in debt & ought to have made apology, if such things & such terms should be made, or used between us. I have just been re-perusing with renewed pleasure a very kind epistle of thine, dated the 8th day of this year, as well as thy truly acceptable one of 30th ultimo by both which, & by thy correspondence & friendship I think myself much favoured. Indeed the kindness & attention of my numerous friends both there & elsewhere is grateful & humbling to me - & stimulates to fresh desire to be enabled to walk more worthy of such affection & condescension. The observation also of the many pregnancies & births, the blossomings & bearings in this fruitful year is a renewed incentive to diligence, watchfulness & greater deepening. I [pencil note] x am by no means satisfied with myself  but I am delighted with the prospect of my earnest, solicitous, importunate petitions being answered  that if I should never be of any material service in religious society  that I might but be preserved, thrown by in any obscure corner, so as not in divine displeasure - & that the visited, rising generation might be a generation to serve the Lord God of their forefathers in their day, & to lift up the ensign of his Truth among the nations. I salute thee, my dear friend, returned from that unfrequented, uncultivated field of labour, in which thou hast been employed.* Thy dedication, thy sacrifice was noble, & I trust has been acceptable. Thy debility & infirmities of body as well as of mind are perfectly known to him with whom we have to do, & he estimates in his just balance the measure of our devotedness & obedience. May he reward thine with the blessing of preservation - & if such be his will may an increase of ability, both natural & spiritual, be experienced by thee, that so thy beautiful gift may be ^fully &^ forcibly & exercised to the praise & honour of the great Giver, who has done so great things for thee, to the edification of the churches, & to the gathering of ^the^ other sheep to the

fold of Christ! Somebody (I apprehend by thy letter) has been telling thee something about our poor Sally. I hope the dear child is not doing or saying much amiss - I do think she is a careful, circumspect walker, & inward in spirit, diligent in retirement  so trust if she makes any mistakes she will not be long without seeing them, & I believe will humbly submit to the disciplining, forming, fashioning hand of the great Master +++ Our beloved E.P. is (it may well be imagined) much in my thoughts: I trust she is of the weighty, ponderous grain, which every ruffling, whistling wind will not agitate  The perturbation of her mind from various causes has no doubt been great, & the nailing to the cross attended with agonizing pangs  but thou canst tell her that by continuance in faithfulness & obedience, the pain to the natural part will decrease, & courage & confidence abound, so that as the apostle says of the daughters of Abraham & Sara, she will do well, & not be afraid with any amazement. +++ We had the company of ^dear^ Mary Ridgway & Jane Watson here for a few days ++ Mary was ^rather^ poorly in health, but mended in spirits & lively in the exercise of her gift. She is faithful, so she is happy - & though wave succeeds wave, she emerges clean, clear, & bright +++ We hear now & then from dear Anna Taverner  considering she is Anna Taverner, she is wonderfully well  In a long letter from her dated 1st instant I think she does not say a word of her state of bodily health, as though she forgot herself  but it is apparent by her effusions that her mind enjoys a pure, serene air. +++
Farewell, my dear friend!
