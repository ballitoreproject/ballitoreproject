My dear Lucy,
I came into town the day after
thou left us to pay a little visit to Mecklenburgh
of which was long promised, I staid there
till seventh day morning, I did not see much
variety while there. Sally & I one day walked
out Glasnevin to Dr Walsh's we got in to the
hot houses at the Botanic gardens, and saw a
great many curious plants. Dr W's family dined
one day at Mecklenburgh st. & they were the only new
faces I saw. I came out to the Glen on seventh
day with my Mother & Sally Malone. John & Martha
Co. & R Shackleton, Anne Jane Henry & Mr Thomas
the Dr could not come which disappointed us
all it was a very dreary day windy and heavy
showers of sleet. I came in that night with J & M
as we are to fix with Petrie this week to give
us the instructions, we have not begun yet
but will tomorrow if nothing happens to prevent

I have but little in the way of news to tell
thee. I suppose thou hast heard that Emma Gamble
is very ill, but little expectation of her getting
over this attack. I was sitting with her for
a while last seventh day, she seemed very
poorly, her strength quite gone and no appetite
whatever she told me she never felt the
same before she did not know what ailed
her. Since that she has been much worse
I did not hear to day how she was but yesterday
she thought herself a little better. I went to
 see my Aunt G yesterday Mary having told
me that she was not well, but was agreeably
disappointed to find her up and seeming
pretty well she complained a little of a pain
in her shoulder which is sometimes so bad
as to prevent her knitting. She gave some
old valentines to read which were written
in my Grand mothers time. the day will
soon be here now. but alas, [underline]I[/underline] do not expect
to get one. nor do I think I shall send one

I hope you are all well since thy return
I heard Regy & Fanny since rejoiced to see thee
has Sarah gone to see thee or will she stay
long in Limerick. I suppose the knot is
half tied by this between RFL & SF. I
wonder what kind of a match it will be
there is horsemansh[insertion]i[/insertion]p i [/insertion] p here Cooke's horses we
saw going down Jackville st. the other day
a great show. six poneys were in one
carriage (not under it) eating hay quite
unconcernedly, several ladies were riding
on some of the horses and Cooke himself
was driving a carriage with six horses, three
and three abreast, not the usual way yoked
the carriage was full of ladies. Ducrow is to
come also so I suppose there will be rivalry
I was out at Rathmines yesterday I am to
dine there on first day with John & Martha
if I am in town. Martha desires her love
  and accept a large share [deletion]from[/deletion] for thyself
and thy good man from thy affectne Sister
Selina
