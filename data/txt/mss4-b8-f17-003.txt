My dear father
I am going to make what I think
& am afraid thou wilt think rather an
unreasonable request, Edw mends so slowly
that there is scarcely a shade of difference
in him these last 3 days & the Doctor
thinks he will not get on till he can get
out he ask'd us if we had any friend
who had a private chaise that we could
borrow for about 2 weeks a hackney coach
is too uneasy for his back & we were [unclear][/unclear]
if thou could spare us one of thy chaises for
that time & one horse we could put our
own horse along with [deletion]it[/deletion][insertion]thine[/insertion] to draw it, I would
not ask this at all only that I know Edw
would not be satisfied to continue going
out long enough in a hired chaise as it
would cost from 15s/- to a pound every day
he would use it, if thou could not spare
a horse perhaps we could get one at Glendruid
to put with E's but I fear any of those not being
used to draw a carriage ours is so gentle that
we do not fear him, - another thing I

wanted to ask, whether thou remember'd our commission
to look out for a horse for Edw to [unclear][/unclear]
as he will not get his health without exercise
Do not think bad of refusing the carriage
if thou would rather not send it, if thou
have no objection say where our man should
meet John & when. Ah! poor Anty I
was grieved to hear of her death she was so
good & so useful, how slowly poor Elith [unclear]recover[/unclear]
Edw thinks it better thou should not send
the chaise till we write again
I hope my aunt Sally is better without
Edw about in the easy chair for [unclear][/unclear] 
at a time in the evening to make him
used to motion he bids me tell Eben to put
off coming as long as he can but he may be able
to talk to him ever thy affect daughter S Barrington
We can give Eben a bed
now he [unclear]reced[/unclear] 
as E has [unclear][/unclear] free from fever these
as the time
of his going
out is
uncertain
the Doctor
mention'd
the beginning
of next week
I will expect
thy answer
soon & do
not hesitate
to refuse if
it is inconvenient
