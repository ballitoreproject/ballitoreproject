Curlews which frequent these

they say are some white rabbits

way of going to Killarney to morrow
way of going to Kilarney to morrow
but intend trying for seats on
the long car which if we do

ourselves - An American fellow
traveller offered to join with us
in hiring two cars there, but
it is not settled yet -.

in very comfortable lodgings
