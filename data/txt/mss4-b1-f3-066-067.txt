137			R. S. to his Daughter Deborah	
				Dungannon, 13th of Fifthmonth 1779
		*** My dear Child, I am going about espousing the concern and engagement of another, for the propagation of true religion, & sometimes feeling some degree of engagement in my own mind for the same. Thou mayst, therefore, expect that my letter should contain and convey some religious matter and tincture. But I seldom find an opportunities, of a religious kind, more deeply and solidly beneficial to my spirit, than those which I meet with in my seasons of private retirement at home. To this assiduous, diligent waiting for, and seeking after, the resurrection of a divine life, inwardly stirring in their own minds, I, above all things, recommend my dear children, as the surest way to be preserved, as well as to grow and thrive in religious experience.
							R. S.
