Ballibarny 11th March April
Esteemed Friend
On perusing thy more than kind letter
it calmed my agitated bosom for on the 4th Mar an occurrence
happened that very much distres'd my mind and
pierced my very heart, indeed it was so severe and galling
that it brought [insertion]me[/insertion] almost to a fixt resolution to quit
the Co. Kildace and never more to set my foot in it;
at a future period I will fully acquaint thee with it, but
at present I must be totally silent, nor did Dream seem to
take the least notice of it although it concerned the entire
happiness of my little family~
My wife returns thee her sincere thanks
for what thee observed about the Habit [unclear]Shirts[/unclear], and as soon
as our little business of serving the Oats and Potatos
are over will, will, most willing avail herself of thy
kind assistance, as I hope by that time the wealther will
Mrs. Leadbeater
Ballitore

be fine and she will have full leisure to go on with
them. I am happy to have to inform thee that on tuesday
last my Wife got one Girl, to learn Ornamental
work the first she got since we cam not Ballybarney
Edwd. ONeils daughter and on the same day I have
got a boy to read Bookkeeping these two will be
a great assistance to us, what thee so kindly observ'd
with respect to Oaten food for my Wife it is above our
reach for some little time, and as for my two boys
I will strictly adhere to thy advice with regard to them.
Although the occurrence of the 4th was heart
rending it would be highly ungreateful of me to leave
my little place and I must confess there would be folly
and injustice in it also, it would be serving thee Wm.
R. S, and the rest of my kind friends, extremely bad after
all their Kindness, and it would be injust in leaving
the place without paying my little debts which I
hope God will shortly enable me to do -
Besides it would be treating the Lady very bad, to
keep her ground so long without paying her anything
and as I have now a good sewing which I hope
will enable me along with other assistance to clear the
little Rent that is on it by 29th Sept. as before mentioned
but however I will most willing submit to whatever the Lady
pleases and will keep every thing here in the best state I can
and will keep what goes by the Name of the Ladys Garden
in the highest order that I possibly can -
I hope when the hurry of business is over the School
will be much better; it is four times better at present
than it was last year, and the Lancasterian plan as
far as I can reach it up is highly pleasing now to the
Scholars and saves myself a great deal of trouble, we
will have it carryed on in my wifes School also, I have
given the boys and girls to understand that thee would be
soon with them to give them premiums, it is impossible for
me to say how much I am
thy most Obliged Servt
Micl. Dunn
