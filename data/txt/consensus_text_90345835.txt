not come out until after tea -
Cha is getting on pretty well - I got four
letters two rather remarkable - ones - Doctor Darby,
10 Thursday - Cha did not sleep quite so
well last night - but I hope he will not
be the worse for it -. Jemmy Perry came
over to see him and dined with us -
I paid a visit to Mrs vicar's who had
called here some days ago -
Richard Shackleton came out to see Cha
too but did not stay to tea -
11 Friday - Charlie got up to day and came
down stairs after dinner - Doctor Darby
called to see him - thinks him going on
pretty well - Papa called just before
tea - After Phil, Cha, and I played games.
Perhaps this might be my last night here,
I wonder how events will turn out.
12 Saturday Here I am still - It was
a wet windy day - Charlie not quite
so well [insertion]as[/insertion] yesterday - Ned called this evening
on his way to Fassaroe - After tea Phil
and Cha played the cornopian together,
and it sounded very sweet - Then we
had drafts - &c &c Perhaps this will be my
March
last evening.
