Richmond 7th of 5th mo: 1828.
My dearest Sarah
I recd thy parcel yesterday & today heard
of an opportunity to Dublin, by which I can send
the patterns I promised for Willie - I send three
different kinds - & indeed I feel ashamed to send
what is not perfectly fresh & new - Johnnie's dress
is in hands but was not quite finished so I must
defer sending it until the next oppy - Ben
Fisher went most provokingly unknown to me.
I have not arranged yet how to have the moreen
sent to me - nor have I fixed entirely on the
brown ware [unclear][/unclear] as if Eben should visit Dublin I
would like to get his opinion of it. I am delighted
with the reports of Willie - what is Catherine Jew's
proposal? - is it to take Willie off of Deborah's hands?
Thou wilt oblige me greatly by executing the
enclosed commission for my friend - Thou may
think I think a good deal of her - when I [unclear]have[/unclear]
consent to trouble thee with her commissions. -
She searched Limerick & could not get the
things to match her. - & so she asked me could I
get them for her in Dublin - through some of my
friends. Thanks for the scarf - I like the hankerchief
greatly - & think it dog cheap. - I entirely forgot to
tell thee about my muff & tippet the day I left
you. I really dont know what I had best get done.
I mean to consult my friend Jane Hunter - as she
is a rock of sense & then I shall be troubling thee again.

Oh! that we may have thee here this summer, - It
would delight us all - none more than James
who says, that thou wilt forget his face - or that
he can not forget thine - as we have such a good
likeness of thee. - he is in gay spirits since my
return which I have not yet had cause to regret
hurrying as I did. - This weary affair here is not
finished yet - but my father is quite anxious to
do - as I was telling thee I hoped I would bring him to - to
buy the other share & have all his own. - I will write
to thee at once as soon as all is settled - oh how
sweet every thing looks - & how could we leave it. -
"And must I leave thee Paradise" said Eve - what
else could we say. I am delighted thou art rid of
Mary Lawlor - & I hope thou wilt not be troubled
with any other [underline]botch[/underline]. - Oh! how I long for thee to see
my pretty Mary & my coarse lump Hannah Jane
who goes alone from one to the other - but almost
flies with a finger. - The garden is blooming in sweet
"rich in odours" I wish I could transplant some
to thee. - Our pig had eleven young ones the other
night - there's news for thee & we have goslings
marching about under the surveillance of their papa.
I often wish for Johnny to ride the Ass with &
behind Josy. - & Josy forgetful of past affrays
speaks very lovingly of both [underline]"Maj"[/underline] & Johnny. - he
never calls her any thing else. - Dont nurse Eben

too long for fear of injuring thy own health
my darling. - Eliza Harvey is as thin as
a whipping post pern having givven her great
son too much of her hearts blood. Give
my dear love to Edwd as I must send
this into town & as it is growing late
I believe I must say adieu. How are they
at the Glen ? - I beg my dear love may be
presented to them all. - I hope you will not
disappoint us of our promised pleasure
How pleasant it is to look forward to
a meeting. "And will not a meeting like
this make amends" - I knew thou would
be missing me greatly - am I vain? - It
is delightful that Hannah White is better
& had so much enjoyment.
Farewell my dear Sarah
Ever thy loving
L J Fisher
