Nothing short of hearkening and obeying will do; but diligently hearkening
and faithfully obeying, will do - will do all for thee, and more
than thou canst ask or think.
Farewell, my dearly beloved child. Remember me affectionately
to thy worthy husband, sweet children, all relations & friends.
I must particularize my dear E.P.

R.S. to his Daughter G.
*** Who is exempt from trials and temptations? This life is
the field of battle, and our most dangerous enemies are those of our own house.
May the lamp of God, in the temple of our hearts, be kept still renewed and
replenished with heavenly oil, that we may have a clear sight of what is
doing within us, lest we should think otherwise of ourselves than we really
are. Purity of heart is a main qualification for any service in the church
of Christ: let us then use all diligence to obtain and retain this precious state.
"Blessed are the pure heart, for they shall see God." They shall clearly discern
the things which belong to his kingdom; and when they speak of them
it will be of what they have seen with their spiritual eyes, and what they have
"looked upon"; what has been brought by the Holy Spirit before their internal view,
