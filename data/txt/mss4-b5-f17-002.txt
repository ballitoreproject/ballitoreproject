My dear Cousin /
London 5 mo 27th 1795.
I have but just received thy
[underline] valuable[/underline] Present, it having been delayed by mistake
which I fear will not allow me as much time
to write as I could wish, the meeting being now over, &
several of our relations from Yorkshire intend to
return with us to Wanborough, the place of our
abode - which will prevent our making much
longer stay here, tomorrow I expect to leave town.
Thy particular account of our dear Cousin J Shackleton's
health and the rest of our beloved relations is very
gratifying - I have for some time past intended
writing to thee in reply to thy acceptable Letter
which I received in London on my return from
Norfolk where my dear M.B. & my self had
been on a visit to my brother & sister Birkbeck,
we were absent three months, my health had
been very indifferent, Bathing was recommended

they have a pleasant House near the sea, where they
spend greatest part of the summer season—I bathed
frequently, the journey & altogether I thought was of use
since that I have had a return of my billious complaint
& have been greatly relaxed which rendered me unfit
for any thing almost & must plead excuse for my
long silence—It will be acceptable I doubt not, to
thy Worthy Mother to be informed, that we are very
comfortable in the connection to our son has formed; his
wife is an amiable young woman, not yet twenty one
she has a sweet little boy above 4 months old, he has
lately been under inoculation, & is finely recovered, his
Mother is an excellent nurse—We have not left them,
they are both desirous of our continuing, their House is
large, we have a lodging room & sitting room to ourselves
we breakfast & drink tea generally in our own apartment
dine & sup with them—our Grandson's name is
Richard—we are four miles from meeting, & have
no friends nearer, or neighbor within a mile, the
country is beautiful, I hope my son's farm will answer

he is accounted a good Farmer, industrious & attentive
to his business, yet not inattentive to religious & civil
duties, he is likely to be an useful member of society—
Tell my cousin Abram, I endulged a hope of meeting
with him here, & am not a little disappointed, why did
he not come? tell him also, that my silence has not
been owing to any abatement of affection, I feel the same
sentiments of regard I ever had, for you all, & had & health
& spirits, should with pleasure pay you a visit, but the water
now appears so formidable that I believe I shall not
have courage to attempt it, tho' we sometimes talk of it, my
dear Husband would accompany me, he is kind & indulgent
I have great course to be thankful for such a Husband & son
I may now add daughter, they are all kind & attentive to me
Please to remember us affectionately to our dear cousin E. Shackle
to cousins T & D Chandle & their sweet children, also to cousins Abram
Lydia & theirs, cousin Sarah and thy Husband—mine unites in
dear love to thee, as my son & daughter would I doubt not
were they present—they left town this morning—with their little
charge being a nurse she could not leave him behind—
please to accept the enclosed small token from thy truly
affectionate cousin
Sarah Birkbeck
excuse this hasty scrabble

I am ashamed to send thee this shabby letter time
will not admit of many apologies—I shall be glad
to hear from thee & my dear cousin D Chandlee
Please to direct for Morris Birkbeck Wanborough
near Guildford Surry
