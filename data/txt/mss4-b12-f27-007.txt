My dearest Aunt
I wrote [insertion]my last letter[/insertion] in such haste
to catch our ridiculously early
post that I forgot to mention
that you made a mistake
in thinking my Birthday fell
on the 15th Augt, It is not till
the 15th of Sept. So the Paris
Fete is not commemorating it.
Tell Uncle I got "Le Petit
Journal" on Monday night.
for wh I am obliged, from
it there appears to be several
mad Dogs I hope he will not
come across them in his rambles
I hope we will soon have
another letter from you saying
how you are going on
and what Dr Nelaton thinks
&c We are quite anxious about
you -

As I promised to write to you
every two or three days having
a few minutes to spare while
waiting on Mama & Grd Mama
I begin this to have so much
of it ready against the day
for posting it.
I sent Gr Ma & Mama
out alone yesterday to take
a nice drive Tom took them
to Shanganagh Terrace from wh
there is a lovely view. While
looking at it a very agreeable
Quaker lady ran out of one of
the houses to speak to them
Is that Mrs Barringtons carriage
"Yes Ma'am" Said Tom "Is she
coming to see me? "I rather
think not Ma'am", so she went
& spoke to both Grma & Mama
remarked how very well the
former was looking asked Mama
was she [insertion]quite[/insertion] recovered & how all her
family were &c. &c Now the best
of the joke is that neither Grma
nor Mama know who she is
Such a laugh as I had, when
they returned, about it. Grma
promised she wd call to see her
but she dont know who to ask
for. Tom dont know her either
she has dark hair, thin features
about middle age, & [deletion][/deletion]
seems to be a married woman.
She came lately to Shanganagh
Terrace & will not stay long.
My curiosity is aroused so much
I dont intend to leave a stone
unturned till I find out who she
is for she evidently knows
Mama & Grma quite well.
Mary White is better I paid
a visit there to tell her about
you I also called on the [unclear]fifth[/unclear]
& met Annie venturing out for
a little walk. she says she
had a very sever attack. They
[underline]all[/underline] send their love to you

so does Philip whom I met on
the road. Did you get a
letter from Margt & Polly -
The former wrote to you
17 Augt. No letter from you today
we are longing for another fresh
account of you Wednesday night
now & the latest news we have
of you was written on Friday
I hope to get one tomorrow
Grma Mama & I dined at
Fassaroe yesterday No other
stranger there so it was
a quiet day. To day Grma
& Uncle Manliff dined at
Aunt Marthas to meet Mary
Gamble & Mrs Sparks. - Mama
was so bad with the head ache
& pains she could not stir
she did not get up till late
she is a shade better this
evening. E Jacob too was not
well so I after settling Grma's
