My dear Lucy
I was sorry that there
was not a better account from
you this morning of poor Francis
I hope the 2nd bleeding made
him more easy - I used
to find that when Edw. was
ill & could not get sleep to
rub his legs very gently either
with the hand or a soft towel
quieted him greatly & often
put him into a doze he used
to like it exceedingly & think
it rested his poor limbs
if [deletion]he[/deletion] [insertion]Francis[/insertion] is in the least degree in

a perspiration [deletion]the[/deletion] wiping his limbs
very gently with a soft warm
towel would encourage it
& I do think it would tend
to procure sleep, stroking
the feet sometimes procures
quietness & sleep - I thought
I wd just mention this to thee
as I have found it of much
use in nursetending yet
I hope before this time that
you have both got a little
rest & that tomorrow's [unclear]account[/unclear]
will be later than to day's
give my love Elizth
thy SB
23d
