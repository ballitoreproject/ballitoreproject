off to town preparatory to his going down
to Orange Hill this evening - so now
our little home party will be minus
[underline]one[/underline] and lonely enough! We shall
mind the change more than he for
Orange Hill is a pleasant place and
he will enjoy the society of a sister
to whom he has always appeared more
attached than to the others. It may
be only my imagination though -
It is a great advantage that his lot is cast
for the present amongst friends instead of
strangers -
Rode down to Enniskerry to day with
[underline]7 [/underline]letters -
9 Tuesday - N.P. except a very extraordinary
in Dublin
10 Wednesday - Victoria went to town for
the first time in her life and was in
great glee. Jane Pim drove over with
all the children and her cousin Caroline
who is paying a visit there -
Heard from Thos Henry who tells me
clap of thunder which was heard
