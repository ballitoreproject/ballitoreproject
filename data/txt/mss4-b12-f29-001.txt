My dear Lucy
This morning we had great
talk in school about "Aunt Lucy"
Willy asked leave to write a note to
 her for "we likes any aunt better
than aunt Lucy" - then why write to
her? no we means that we like
aunt Lucy better than any aunt we
have: - Mag. said "then I like
aunt Lydia a great deal the best" -
"I like aunt Selina best" said John.
They were tolerably quiet writing notes
but Nazar had one terrible fit of roaring
Yesterday I went to leave a letter
with Frances for Miss Badge Dunlavin.
on my way a young gentleman very
nicely dressed and mounted alighted wanted from

his [unclear]horses[/unclear] and offered his arm to a
lady in mourning, "in figure [underline]petite[/underline]
and exquisitely symmetrial"; as he
was not in black I was curious to
see what they were to each other, and
walked behind them determined to
get a glimpse of [underline]her[/underline] face, [underline]his[/underline] was
very visible turned to [underline]hers[/underline] - at length
they turned down Parliament St. and
I saw it was old and ugly, at least
plain and elderly - I was provoked
almost as much as in Liverpool
when I saw a black's face on the
finest female figure I ever saw -
Now is not this mere chat?
[unclear]Ofte[/unclear] spent First day entirely alone
I thought of you very much and
felt more lonely than if you had been

in Werburgh Str. [deletion]and[/deletion] tho' we might
not have met.
Jos Jacob called a while ago to
take me off "to bathe with Sarah
and the children" - I am longing
to bathe and would have managed
if it had been an offer I liked, but
whilst she is so stiff and does not
call here, or speak agreeably I do
not like to be obliged to her - Jos
would melt with kindness,
She freezes by the reverse - I told
him I could not go comfortably but
was obliged to him.
We took tea at the Botanic
Garden on Seventh day evening and -
the Doctor with his family every one
of them came to us on Second day to
to tea - I have got a pond for

my swan, it has a rock with a cave in it,
some Liverpool sand-stone and our native
granite, and is paved with nice pebbles -
"[underline]Who paved it[/underline]"? I have "Forget me not" -
pulled and presented by George Cuthbert round
about it, and stone crop about the rocks, quite
picturesque, a dove is brooding on the rock -
I have a new species of waterlily and a geranium
leaf floating on the surface by way of a real one.
We are going to dine at Jonah Malone's
today - Catherine and [unclear]M A Ardell[/unclear] took tea
with us last night they were talking about thee
I suppose you heard of the barefaced murder
of Mr. Sneyd - My eldest pupil Jane Williams

was close to him when he was shot, she was
so frightened that she thought she was shot
herself and leaned against the wall, she saw
the man come up, take the pistol from his
coat, fire at the other [deletion][/deletion] over the [unclear]cape[/unclear][/insertion], saw
his hat roll away and he kicking, when the
villain returned and shot him through the
chin - then said she "I saw where there
was a slope in the [unclear]flags[/unclear] and one of the
round things over the coal holes his blood
running down and filling that round thing"-
The man did not attempt to escape, I
asked her would she know him, she said not

she was so frightened she could not see right -
nor did she know [insertion]how[/insertion] long she staid, but she ran
home and it was near four o'clock, she left
school at ten minutes past 2 - This is, I
believe an exact account, as the child describes
things remarkably [insertion]well[/insertion] and always speaks truth.
Yesterday she did not seem at all like herself,
her very countenance was different, she'll
never forget it, she saw what few witness
and none would ever wish to behold - Since
Percival's death, we never heard of such an
open murder - I wonder will the villain
be hung? Few could return as he did to
finish the horrid work - Write soon to
MG.

I shall judge whether such a
letter is acceptable by your promptitude
in telling me how you are settled.
