Dungannon 26th of 1st Month 1766
My Friend,
yesterdays post brought me Thine of the 21st which is Acceptable; I take it for True, That the Earthy Body still presses down the mind that museth on many things, what will It avail us should We anxiously take thought? as for my part, I could never find I thereby added to my Stature, but on the contrary have rather suffered Loss thereby: This however is necessary for us to Learn, Viy how to want & how to Abound and to Improve Each dispensation, if we are tried with poverty, the Cause is Either from within our selves, or allotted to deepen our hunger and make us fitter to receive divine favour; if when we are favored we abide not under the Impression thereof so as to Improve thereby, its Justice we should again feel Hunger Many days; I am now forty one years & allmost one day old and Expect the (by much) greater part of my Race is Run, I have often thought that if I did not attain a stedy stability before this time of my Life I could not Expect it afterwards, the Period I had fixed, (or Rather that fixed in my mind) is now a year Past; as it drew near I frequently Calld my self to Account and the same since it Roled by me, but alass I saw and still sees I am far beneath that standard to which I feel my mind Called; this however I have Learnd that, all I have Known that was good was only the bread allotted for the then day; I have allso learnd that the favourable opinion of others is not a safe bread to feed upon; but is Equaly dangerous to a Trust in past Experieance; but, My Friend, a dayly Care to stand Approved in the light of the Great Searcher of Hearts, is sound Meat, and such as strengthens the Root, tho at times,, The figgtree should not Blossom, and the Labour of the Olive seem to fail,,
	Thy Caution Against Wisdom the Rong way is good, and alow me to [crossed out] add that many of the highly favoured and renewedly visited, have thereby made themselves a long Wilderness thereby; if I have at all Passed over Jordan; or if Ever my feet stood firm in that River, it has been by simply following the Captain of the Lords Host, who met with me at a season when my Heart Awaked for this Cause, my own salvation, and the salvation of the People, I have known the fire of Love & True Vision; and Experiance hath Taught me to distinguish ^between^ this and an Zeal without Knowledge; Perhaps I may sometimes draw the bow Either too sudden, or Too severe, but when I feel an arrow put into my hand with a command to Smite against spiritual Iniqu^i^ty in the high place; I believe it has been & will be my duty to spake the word faithfully; I am not Insencible of the thoughts and perhaps fears of some concerning me Respecting this matter, and Even of some who are no strangers to the word of Religeon in a good degree; & it must have been an Evil in me not to have lookt deeply at this matter, This I have done with as much singleness as I have been Capable off, and am more & more Confirmed that silence is better, than the Three forths of the ministry in this Nation I Know to whom I am Writing
	I dont take amiss (From Thee) being Rankt with folks of Emenence, but Let me allso add thereto? what Ever I am that bares any Relation to True greatness its by being Little Very Little, and if I am at all wise its by being a Fool a Very fool, I am allso sencible (never more so) that its the same that makes, that alone can preserve nor has he that puts on the Armour any Cause to Boast but he only who abides the fight to the End and puts it off; if I see any thing right I see that I must be frequently reduced & that the Path of humility must be the Path of my feet not only for a Time but all my Life Long, to conclude This matter, the searchings of my heart are I believe deeper than many conceive, and how can the but be deep when I consider how weak I am; the weight of the work assignd; and how much depends upon my Fighting the good Fight by doing of which I shall stand approved at the End of days; Let us Dear Richard as fellow soldiers in the good warfare and fellow Sojourners towards the city of the saints solemnity Press forward as men Indeed bound for Heaven, stedy in our steps, devoted in our hearts, and faithfull in all things, that when Called hence we may be admitted into the Triumphant Host of the Redeemed from the Earth, Its this my heart is at present most set upon, and which Thro, the, Grace of God, I humbly hope, neither heights or depths will be permitted to sepperate me from
	My Dear Loves to Thy most stedy half dont be Too Much Wrapd up in Each other for when Even this is Carried beyond its due bounds I have seen it to be a rong food, Bread from above dayly Receivd is the great matter, My Love to Father &c &c I remain Dear Richard Thy Near Friend
I make no apology for sending this in the Ruff I have not time to Transcribe it, correct it thyself, Thomas Greer
