My dear Elizth
We arrived [insertion]here[/insertion] safe, Margt.
was very little trouble in the
Coach which we had entirely
to ourselves, I gave her some
medecine & hope she will look
better in a few days she is
very lively & was greatly pleased
to see Rose & Johnny she knew
them quite well but seems to
have forgotten her uncles
I would thank thee to get me
2 or 3 hd of good baking apples
from Shannon & send
We dined on the goose
to day a great [unclear]rarity[/unclear]

with the others by the carman
& if there is a kind of eating apple
which will keep better than the
[unclear]Rones[/unclear] please send some of them
also say 1 or 2 hd, I would
like to have the 2 hd of Rones
also, I am very troublesome
but I hope thou'lt excuse me
thy SB
I write in haste
but intend writing again
by Betsy B
I hope my fathers leg improves.
My dear love to him
& my mother
