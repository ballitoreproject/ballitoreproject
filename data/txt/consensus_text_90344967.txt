10th month
Papa and I came out and were
met by the carriage as Mama
had been paying a visit to
Rebecca Brown whom with Miss
Hill she invited to our party and
they say they will come - On
our way home it rained very
heavily and has continued so
the rest of the evening I think.
I have just written a letter to
Lilly -
27th. Another wet dreary morning.
Papa went to town and Mama
who accompanied him as far
as Bray brought back some
refusals to our party one from
Aunt Lydia another from Josey
and one from J Perry jr - While
[extra line]
R Leadbeater cannot come either
he [underline]says[/underline] at least.
