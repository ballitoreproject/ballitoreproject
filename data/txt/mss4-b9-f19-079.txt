2nd day 1824
My dear E - I found my old letter so I send
the bill & receipt - I hope my mother is better
I wish Ballitore was a little nearer to us that we
might see each other oftener - my poor uncle
Wright has not recover'd himself since the fryst
he got & seems quite dull - did you hear
of Jos Chryton's failure ? his wife is much
to be pitied I wonder Wm Alexander
let him go down - RSL looks very
well & pleasant it was cheering to see him
I hope thou'lt write soon & say how my
mother is I enclose 3/11 which clears us
I would be glad to get a small bowl of butter
perhaps 10.th as soon as convenient - Richd
write tell thee more news than I can
tell my aunt Sally with my dear love that
I could not get a crimping knife for
her I do not think they are to be had in
Dublin Limerick is the place - I had very
little hopes that thou could come see us yet I thought
a few days might be spared if M Ser.d take thy place

I had no idea of my riches
in caps, where didst thou
make them all out
Elizabeth Leadbeater
tell M S I am much obliged
for the beautiful vine leaf
I hope the wearer wont be
a bachanal
