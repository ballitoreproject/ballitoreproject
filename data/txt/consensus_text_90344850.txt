are very nice from the little
I saw of them. We came
away at about ten O'clock.
I asked Charlotte to come back with
us next first day from meeting
and I think she will -
10th Went to meeting with Margt. L.
saw C Pim, and H Millner
the latter I asked to dine and
take tea which invitation she
accepted and we spent a pleasant
day together. It was monthly meeting
and I saw Florence and Jane at
it = After dinner Henrietta and
I went to see the exhibition of pictures
I went to see the exhibition of posters
which was not by any means a
very good one, at least so we bad
very good one, at least so we both
judges thought Charlie went
home with Henrietta. Papa went
out to Fassaroe this evening -
11th Rather a gloomy morning,
and lonely enough - Papa came
in, Uncle Thomas Henry dined
