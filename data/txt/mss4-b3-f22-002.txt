Clonmel 6th of 3rd Month 1790.

Beloved Friend
	Richard Shackleton
		I did think of addressing this to thy Son, but a second Thought occurring, that first his worthy Grandfather, and the his Father, stood first in my Knowledge, and that the surviving Parent continues to merit my near Regard and just religious Esteem, so that I thought it would be ungrateful indeed not to acknowledge this much to thyself, or to forget thee in advancing Years, even tho Blindness in part hath happened to thee, nay even should it be wholly no [sic] with the outward Sight, I trust that God, even thy God, will anoint and reanoint the Spiritual Eyes, as he hath hitherto done, not only to see Men as Trees, but clearly to discover Things as they really are; and cause thy Heart to rejoice that he is carrying on his own Work in the Hearts of his visited Children, and out of the Mouths of Babes and Sucklings perfecting his own Praise; to whom it belongs, both now and for ever.
	I do not often feel it in my Line to say much about the Exercise of our getting along, lest, in Times of Adversity, it should look like complaining, or, when a little raised, it should look like boasting; and so be any Cause of Offence to Jew or Gentile, (and as far as others can gather, how the Battle goes, I apprehend Accounts circulate pretty freely) but as People, whose outward Eyes fail, have been thought to have more clear discerning than others, so my dear Friend I believe thou canst judge between Men and Things; and indeed it is thy Station to do so, or otherwise thou would not be filling up thy Place in the Church of knowing the Stars by their Names, and keeping them in order when they move under thy Notice: for which Service I have thought thee as well qualified as any I have met with, and these Thoughts have lived with me, I trust without any Partiality to thyself ancient or new, and as I believe thou wilt conscienciously [sic] measure us by the same Line, I will for once venture to give thee some little Account of our Visit at Cork. Where on our arrival and first sitting together in the gathered Church many of the 

Princes Kings Daughters and Nobles [sic] were assembled, and wherein I was favored to gather in Silence to the Rack of my Strength, as also in the afternoon Meeting in both which some of my fellow Servants had a little to hand out of the Kings Treasury. I had also a secret Intimation I trust from him, that the City was large and much People in it [sic] and perhaps like the Walls of Jerico [sic] might require going about, before any Part would come down, so as Entrance could be gained. At Springmount, at the Time of the evening Sacrifice, many assembled; when the watch Word in my Soul was clearly raised, be thou a faithful Bride to thy beloved Bridegroom, that I believed Silence was still my Place an [sic] also in the next public Meeting, but on the third Day of the Feast our beloved SR Grubb and dear Richard Jacob, in the arising of the fresh Spring set an open Door ^for me^ towards the Gentiles, but towards the Jews I was still shut up and a Stranger. After which we took a Turn to Bandon, and returned to the Synagogue at Cork on the first Day of the Week where my dear Companion and self tried our Weapons a little but found it hobbling Work and hard getting along so that I began to think we might as well leave Things as we found them and departm, but having several Times felt the arising of a secret Impression to have an Opportunity with the Members of the select Meeting and the Overseers together I durst not wholly turn aside from it, but said nothing, of it except to my dear Companion, till [sic] the Time seemed fully come which was after our Return from Kinsale. It being late in the Evening we staid [sic] at Edward Hattons and next Day being their Men and Womens [sic] Meeting I wrote a few Lines early in the Morning to dear Samuel and Sarah Neal [sic] telling them of it and leaving to their better Judgment the further proceeding in it which being united with it was appointed at 1006 [?] the next Morning ^But Oh!^ How dismayed did I feel in going along the Street that I told dear Edward Hatton I seemed like one that had bid so much for a Purchase and would have been glad the Terms had been refused but he bid me not fear any Thing about it and indeed had I attended to a common Phrase They that know nothing fear nothing I need not have let in any. However we met and soon could I adopt the Language my Soul is humbled and become as a wearied Child. And in the simplicity of my Heart I believe I administered what was given in which my beloved Companion united and with her Tongue made Confession to like Things, and the varied Stars in the Order ^feeling^ that the Kings Seal was upon it. It was acknowledged by divers [sic] to be a Season that was owned by the tendering Influence of divine regard and a Hope exprest [sic] that it would be remembered to profit. We had yet in view staying over another first Day; but still no open Door for me safe to enter in at so that I desired to be humbly resigned. My MH labored a little and I believe very suitably tho in Weakness and Fear and as I seemed so shut up from our own People I was unwilling to turn to the Gentiles, but lo! I must, so in great Weakness of Body and Mind (having a heavy Cold upon me) I was resigned that a Meeting should be appointed at the 6th Hour in the Evening being determined in myself to depart the Coasts early next Morning of which at my request my MH informed thee, but told me after she did not do it in the Faith, and yet I hope it 
was not Sin as I then thought it would be so. We met with the People as above mentioned and a great Concourse there was such a one as I have scarcely seen of what is called the higher rank of People with many others of a different Class: and all behaved with more stillness and Gravity than might be expected. And the great Father of Mercies, who is waiting to be gracious to the Children of Men, owning the Gathering I humbly trust it was in a good Degree a satisfactory Opportunity. After which the younger Part of our own Family felt near to my best Life, that I believed it safest to stay the Meeting on 3rd Day when I requested the Children and young People might be as fully out as they could. And a large Gathering it was; with the Addition of many not of our religious Society. And, thro the fresh extendings of heavenly Regard, was a tendering Opportunity much to the Relief of my own Mind. And after dining at John Manders, with many of the chief of the Fathers &c, I think may say we took a solemn Leave. Tho I felt then, and have since more so, that if I had done Justice to my bodily Frame I should have staid a little longer to recover from the Cold instead of setting forward to Youghall and Garryroan which being a long and rough Travel during which my Cold renewed and increased much so that by ^the Time^ we got to this pleasant Habitation on 2nd Day Evening, I was about ready to take to Bed which I have been willing to be resigned to the greatest [obscured by seal] ^Time of^ being here: and having been tenderly cared for every Way I am much relieved from Illness. So that I hope by tomorrow, which being the 1st Day of the Week, I shall be able to assemble with my Brethren and Sisters. And now, my dear Friend, having held out my Speech to thee much beyond Expectation, which my Scribe Jane Taylor has been willing to take down from my Mouth, so that I am freed from any painful Thought that it will even try thy weak Sight to make it out, or that thou wilt need a Thief, or one more crafty than thyself to decipher it for thee; ^may now close^ in the renewing of endeared Love to thyself, thy valuable Wife and her Children, whom I dearly Love in the Truth, in which Salutation my Yokefellow and the Disciples in this House unite with thy nearly affectionate Friend

Dear Friend/
	My Companion having dealt herein, from the aboundings of her heart, both sacrifices the space here, & excuses me from saying much, save that I thought thou returned me a more than adequate remittance, for the few hasty lines I sent thee, so I may keep in remembrance I am thoroly [?] thy debtor, & also tell thee, whilst at Cork, had a letter from P.H. Gurney, who desired her dear love to thee, is better in her health, & now at C:brookdale fixed as her residance [sic], the families there well save J Rathbone, & Samuel Darby much betterexpecting now a short time will bring us together at Waterford if spared so long, seeing neither natural or spiritual eyesight [illegible] enough to bring thee here: I often think of you all my Dear MR is now addressing thy Sarah I am in near affections thy friend

If thy Dear Wifes Sun Moon & Starrs [sic] are deminishing [sic] on the Earthly Hemisphere, she knows it is a comfort, as these decrease; those on the heavenly increase in ^there [sic]^ brightness, & their splendor will endure. And perhaps not fully seen till these are swept away. They veil our prospects, stops our views, prevents that sun from shining; there lands [?] the common lot of all, will only last thro time with those whose sun shall rise tryumphant [sic] with unsullied Glory MH
