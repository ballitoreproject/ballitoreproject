Yanworth 31/12 mo. 1785.
My dear friend,
Thy last letter was not unwelcome to me, though it seemed to sign
my condemnation - Truth & Sincerity, when accompanied by Good-will, I hope will
always be welcome, though they come as Correction, or reproof_If indeed Poetry
stand in the predicament, in which thy last has placed it, I am further wrong than
I supposed_ I do sincerely condemn all licentious works of that sort, however ingeniously
written - some such I have destroyed - But if Poetry tend to inform the mind,
or better the heart, though not literally true; I can hardly think it so reprehensible as
thine seems to suggest._ Poetry will seldom mislead those that understand it_
I mean, introduce things for absolutely true, that are but comparatively so_ And
further: it is but a different mode of language, more told & figurative than Prose_
The Scriptures contain some of the sublimest specimens, & abound with Similes,
Parables & comparisons_ I readily acknowledge, with thee, its' hurtful consequences;
when we rejoice too much in the works of our own hands; when we, as it were, fall
down & worship them _ it then becomes idolatry; & leads us far, far from the paths
of true peace _ & this I own it is frequently in great danger of doing _ But this
temptation is not peculiar, (though perhaps more frequent,) to Poetry _ Every relaxation
from the line of strict duty is liable to the same man _ the builder, the planter, the
gardener, the mathematician, the sociable companion, &c. may all without strict
watchfulness find a little self-exultation spring up_ My friend says he would
spare the Poets, did Christianity allow any time for this delight - But he does not
see how this is all compatible with "Rejoice evermore, Pray without ceasing," &c.
_As I never wish it, I hope I shall never do any thing to stacken the precepts of
Scripture _ but I can hardly conceive the texts quoted in [deletion]the[/deletion][insertion]their[/insertion] full literal sense,
for

for even to the most godly it would seem almost impossible - I believe the text means,
with the greatest fervency, & beyond every other thing, we are to have our eye towards
the Almighty & rejoice in his love - These are my sentiments - But I may be
wrong - Alas! I often find myself wrong - & they may spring from a desire to
palliate a favourite amusement - I own purusing the works of literature is a
favourite amusement - many of my leisure-hours are thus filled up - Yet some of
my time is also spent with the Evangelists, with Paul, Isaiah, Barclay, Penn, &
Woolman - the last of which seems to have carried the purity of Religion as far as it
has hitherto gone - 'Tis from such as these my heart draws substantial food - 'Tis in
the company of such as these, or in that of inward retirement, I feel that I am answering
the end of my being - Yes; my friend we were surely designed for nobler purposes
than to sort words, & weigh syllables - yet Poetry has at times fast hold - I have
often felt it deprive me of something better: & I am only satisfied with myself,
when I behold it in a subordinate station, almost an object of indifference - The
praises my little pieces may have obtained afford something of a transient
pleasure; but they convey not substantial happiness to my heart - happiness
comes through humility, through a perseverance in [deletion]duty[/deletion] doing our duty; & is the
blessing of our heavenly Father for labouring to fulfil his commands.
This is the light in which I see things - & this is the light in which I see
myself, & I hesitate not to shew it my friend - a poor, frail creature, solicitous
after happiness, which often escapes me, & which some times I obtain - Often I wish to -
persevere in my duty; [deletion]I[/deletion] often I endeavour, & often I fail - without (I hope) what the
world calls vices - & often (alas) without the approbation of my own heart - for I believe
the sense of things reposed there is from the Lord
This is the last evening of the year, that I am holding converse with, & unbosoming
my

myself to my friend: & it is hid from us whether we shall be continued through all
the changes of that which is about to commence - If I be spared to see the return of another
close; may it not be in vain - & may I not feel at that period less tender & affectionate
sentiments than I do at present!
Give my love to thy amiable Lydia - I have never seen her; nevertheless * esteem her
I have often heard of her - Thou art happy in a partner, & in a circle of young children
I am fond of children - There is a ready, lively turn; & a natural, innocent sincerity in
children, that pleases me - I have a relation [deletion]that[/deletion] lives near me, that has three fine
ones, with whom I often divert myself; for I really love these little folk of three foot high
With the endearing sentiments of disinterested esteem & good-will I take my
leave at this time.
