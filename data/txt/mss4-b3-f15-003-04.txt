Ballitore: 16th of 8th month 1756

Dear Friend,
	I received thine of 10th & Betty thine yesterday, which give us a clear idea of thy estate & that of things amongst you, so that we cannot but sympathize with thee, & often talk of thee with tenderness of spirit & warmth of affection. But however it be, we seem both to be of confirmed opinion, that, as thou endeavourest to perform thy duty in the ability afforded, & diest daily to thyself, following thy great Pattern, who was despised & rejected of men, a man of sorrows & acquainted with grief, keeping down thy own natural temper, as remembering that the will of man worketh not the righteousness of God, nor helpeth forward his workHe that in mercy visited will preserve & help thee along: & I am persuaded that the more freely we devote our selves without any reserve or fear or shame of man, that the greater we shall feel his support to be, the easier our conflict with ourselves & others, & the speedier our victory. To which devotion of heart that we may be enabled to attain for our own solid peace & the success of the cause which the dear worthies who went before, nobly maintained, is the desire of my spirit. ++++
	thy affectionate friend
		Richard Shackleton
