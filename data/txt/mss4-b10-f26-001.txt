My Dear Eliza
I was very anxious about hearing of
your safe arrival across from Dover as
the day we thought you were to sail was
a great storm here and the wind has
been high here every since, and it was
a great relief to receve your welcome
letter this night by post - I have not
much to tell about us since you left
We felt lonely without you on sunday
and Martha did not come to us I suppose
she wanted the inducement of your and
Thomas company, I went to see Richrd
to [unclear]Farrers[/unclear] on monday last I thought him
very poorly he was brought into town
to the surgeons the next day and has
been in town ever since - Lucy has come
to Martha for a few days and has brought
Emily to stop with me for a while [unclear]thinking[/unclear]

change of air might help her cough I
understand it is better I intend going into town
for her tomorrow - and to call on Farrell
for the seeds, I was at Glenagary this day
[unclear]Mrorny[/unclear] has not yet set any Potatoes he said
the Ground was not ready for them -
He has put out several hundred of cabbage
plants sinc the rain came as the two last
days has been wet here and the severe cold
gone for the present - I have put a stamp
on the letter you Enclosed and will send it
on as directed - we are all well here just
getting on as you left us, I hope your future
Travelling will get pleasantly and that you
write when you c can to tell of your safe arrival
with your friends and when we may expect
your return - we love to you both joind by all
here I am your loving & affet Mother
The Hyacints are all in beautiful bloom greatly
admired
