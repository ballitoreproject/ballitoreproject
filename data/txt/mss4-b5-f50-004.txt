30 Aungier street 5th Month 21st 1818.
My dear friend
Since I last wrote to thee I received
two letters from thee dated respectively the 5th & 22nd
of last month. In the first of those letters thou requested
me to recommend Crabbe to our Quaternion, which I believe
I informed thee before that I did; but he was rejected.
We have finished the fourth Canto of Childe Horold
which the connoisseurs seem to think superior to any
of Byron's former works; I have not read his former
works, therefore cannot give an opinion; but the fourth
canto delighted me very much. When thou art done
with Rush's essays, I would be obliged by thy lending them
to Mary Shackleton, as I believe she wishes to see them
again, & I wish Betsey to read them. I suppose Deborah
takes due advantage of this delightful weather to
improve her health with equestrian excursions... . .
The four members of the quaternion met on the night
of my arrival for the first time since Joseph Fouyle's
illness. Joseph expects shortly to settle to business at
Joseph expects shortly to settle to business at
Dunleavy. Last 3rd. day, I received a letter from
my father. He says that my grandmother continues

confined to her bed (except now & then that she is placed
on a sofa) & without the power of speech, but in other
respects seems improving, & has never been deprived of
her senses, as far as could be observed. My uncle Harvey
speaks of going to the North, to the Quarterly meeting
of Richhill, which will commence the 7th of next month
I saw both Edward & William Tracey at the lecture yesterday,
they are very well, we met Thomas Knott after
lecture, & I was pleased to see four Ballitore boys
together, who had not met before [deletion]for 2 or[/deletion] since they
left school. I suppose more than 4 years. Please to
tell Wm. Leadbeater that I went twice to Mountjoy
square to pay Elizabeth Sweetman the rent which he
entrusted to me; but was disappointed each time as
the [underline]clerk was not at home to give me a receipt![/underline] It
is very unpleasant to have any thing to do with those
[unclear]at[/unclear] people who are not able to write a receipt.
They put themselves and others to a great deal of inconvenience.
Yet these are called the [underline]politer circles[/underline]. What
then is Politeness? As soon as I [underline]can[/underline] pay this rent
& [deletion]re[/deletion] obtain a receipt, I shall send it to William.
With warm affection to my Ballitore friends, whom
I like better the more I know of the rest of the world
& in hopes of a letter from thee soon
Where is James?
I remain thy affectionate friend
Thomas Fisher.
