Ballitore, 28 of July 1780.
My dear friend,
I am much obliged to you for your kind
favour, I should have answered before now, but I was not willing
'till after the wedding, & since the wedding I was happily
taken[deletion]g[/deletion] up with the company of dear sweet P. who
came up to the wedding; he remained from Saturday night
'till friday morning, & then set out in the company of
Mr: Mellor. I think you'l never see him hartier nor
happier than he seems to be, may the Almighty guard
& keep him so; you had a great loss of not being at home
at this wedding as there were a great deal of young
men at it. I wish we had a wedding every month,
if the sweetest young man that was there, would come
& see them all; if it were not for his being there I should
not think much of the wedding, the Meeting was very
strong & noisy, he spoke quick, & she spoke low, I think
if there were four such weddings as them I would not go.
I hope the next will not be so, Your Sister I hope
is mending, indeed her Spark is very spritely, & constant
in his courtship. You tell me you are not for coming home
short

shortly; I am sorry for your long stay, but exceeding glad
of your happiness, in finding every place agreeable, I hope
you will ever be so, may the Almighty grant it to you
& yours, you desire to know who my Banker is, Billy
has been for a while, for I had no sooner clear'd one draft
than there was another, to your Brother, you desire to know
how I go on in my business; indeed the Lord make me
thankful very well, I have a deal of little sortments that
I had not before you went, & gets tolerable call for every
thing I have; my little place is very snug & decent, I
wish the time was expired & you had got all your pleasure,
& you return'd home to see what little repairs I
have [deletion]done[/deletion] made, & what addition I have to my little stock
I am very sure you would be glad it was greater. I think
all the Neighbours here, are pritty much as you left
them, neither deaths, births or Marriages but the one,
both Masters families are all well. I understand you
are now in Cork, I know not how this will go to you,
but I expect to try, Little Coote has returned home
to School, your little bird is well, I brought him a
Quart of Hemp-seed on thursday, I am bravely myself
& so is my Pig. My Potatoes promises to be very
good. Peter went with me to see them, he seem'd
rejoicd at my triving condition. I hope it will not
be

belong before I have the Company of him & you together, which
indeed I much long for, for indeed tho' great your pleasure
is, I think the place very [unclear]quire[unclear] without you; but I suppose
you will only come for a little while, when you do
come, I expect no other than thre will some Munster
follow Galloping down after you Maddam, if it
be so, be it [unclear]from[/unclear] what provine he will; may the
Almighty grant that he may be good & kind,
which is the worst [insertion]wish [/insertion]of [deletion]your[/deletion]
your ever loving &
dutiful Servant
Mary Whelan
P.S.
I do not know whether I should expect another
Letter from you before you come or not, if
it be convenient I should be very glad to hear
from you. pray give my love to Mr. Penrose.
I suppose you have a Courtship going on in Munster
between Mr. Helton & Miss Pemberton.
