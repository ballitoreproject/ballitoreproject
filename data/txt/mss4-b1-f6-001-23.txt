Superbe-Trenchall-road Island of Madeira
My dear Tom,
With extreme satisfaction I now reserve one hour from the
hurry & bustle of duty to converse with my dearest Brother, hoping
that this will find you in America, in as good & perfect health &
great spirits, as your Sam is now on board a noble Man of War moored
in Trenchall-road, & destined for the East-indies, toward where we sail
on Sunday or Monday next - it is needless to tell you I am freighted
with sanguine hopes [insertion]of[/insertion] preferment & riches - & have great reason to be
so, being most strongly recommended by my late most worthy commander
Capt: Jervis to Adml. Hughes & Capt: Simonton - I have been Master &
Mate ever since the first of Feby. & otherwise much favoured - so I think
I have much reason to expect preferment in an India-voyage. +++
This Island of Madeira is a fine, plentiful Island, tho' mountainous,
plenty of other necessaries as well as wine. The people I believe are better
off than the inhabitants of popish [insertion]governments[/insertion], generally are, owing to their great
intercourse with the English. I was ashore, had a horse, & rode all round
the Island almost, & was much pleased with every thing I saw; not that
the people are pleasing by any means, but my curiosity was satisfied,
consequently I was pleased, until now I have time to recollect on what I
saw; & now after mature recollection I do pronounce the [deletion][/deletion] Inhabitants
(the English excepted) to be a most despicable race - Bigot[deletion]t[/deletion]ry, superstition, &
knavery under their [deletion]ill[/deletion] poverty & ill-looks detestable - however, I had
a good dinner among them at the Sun-Tavern - & paid but 4 pistorcens
& a bit, which I think is moderate - & we are all much refreshed with
their oranges, lemons, Bananas, fresh Beef & vegetables - so gratitude
will oblige me to pity them, & leave them my hearty wishes for
their spiritual reformation - Now leaving Madeira - with inconceivable
velocity I will conduct you back to old England, & inform you
that
