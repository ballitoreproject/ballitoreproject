Papa intends going
out this evening.
Had a letter from
Polly; they were at
the Glen last evening,
Fanny returned with
them. I hope to go
out to-morrow -
26th.. A wet morning,
John and I went out
to Monkstown meeting,
where we met Polly,
Lilly, Philip, and Fanny
from Fassaroe -
Jossy Strangman
who has come up
from Waterford returned
with us from meeting.
We called at Glendruid
where we saw Grandmama.
