My Dear Bess -
By this time (which is 8 O'Clock) I have every hope
of your enjoying at R, the company of John & Mag, with their little one, after
a safe passage. - I congratulate my dear, dear Parents, on their having,
for the [underline]first[/underline] time, the satisfaction of having in their own House, a Grand-Child;
- and a fine one too. - I hope Mag will be benefited by this excursion,
as she has been very poorly for some time back, - and that she
& the Child will return with increased Health. -
I almost think I am a witness of the pleasure which
sparkles in the eyes of the whole family at R, more especially I enjoy
that portion of it which I think is exibited in the countenance of our
honored Father & Mother. - may no intervening cloud, darken
the brightness of so sweet a prospect as that which I hope you all
now enjoy. -
Write a line by John, & tell me every thing. -
- I hear today that Jos Morris rested pretty well last night, & that
he was easier today than yesterday. -
With love to you all, I remain ever my
dear Parents & Sisters affectionate. -
RManliffe
tell John that there was 74 frames of soap in a boil, - & that
Wm. Pim sent for 5 Cwt. of soap. - Wm. was obliged to borrow one load from
Mick Syke. -
