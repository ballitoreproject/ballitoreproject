P 142.			R. S. to his Wife.

				Ballitore [blank space] Ninthmonth 1779.

		*** I am thankful that through all, and through all my own many infirmities, I have a place in the hearts of the generality of my friends: having been preserved from retaliating evil for evil, but still endeavouring to overcome evil with good. And I am thankful that, as to natural things, the little meal in the barrel, and the little oil in the cruise, has not, through the favour of our great Benefactors, yet failed; nor is the spring of humble, and, I trust, holy gratitude, dried up in me, for the capital favour of such a wife and such children as I am blessed with: but, on the contrary, I may figuratively say, rivers of grateful tears run down my eyes for the same. If our dear Mary be restored to us, it will be a particular additional favour. ***
	Remember me in the most affectionate and grateful manner to J. and E. Pike whose house we trouble, not only as an inn, but an hospital. I can do little in return for such manifold favours; but  I have prayed that retribution may be made them for their kindness by Him who has all power to bless.
					R. S.
