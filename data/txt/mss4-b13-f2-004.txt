I was well pleased to see his precious wife once more. At Robt..
Benson's in the evening, after his reading a little to his well-regulated
family, Sarah had to minister sutible food, I doubt
not:- she pressed encreasing faithfulness on the amiable heads
of the family, whom she felt like a father & mother. Second-morning
Robt.. Fayle went in search of Saml.. Emlen:- we staid
within pretty much: after supper S:T expressed a few words,
relative to every heart knowing its own bitterness &c: Third-
day we call'd at a school, the mistress's name, Elizth.. Kenyon; here
Sarah had to minister to a sweet-looking little number of children.
Fourth-day evening before leaving a friends house, Thos.. Binns,
where we took tea, S:T had to speak encouragingly to the young
friends present;- amiable-looking friends they are. Fifth-day to
meeting, which was a time of prostration to my spirit- dear Sarah
