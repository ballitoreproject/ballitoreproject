Cousin Mary will be kind enough to buy for me, one yard of
[insertion]fine[/insertion] muslin fit for caps such as thou would like thyself, I know
my dear Molly too well, to make an appology for this trouble
as I have already experienced, thy having pleasure in obliging
thy friends, my dear love is to those who may enquire for me
or who thou think, (or know,) I love, among whom are my
dear Unkle & Aunt, and precious Sally, who I do love more than
I shall now express, also to our dear Anna, who I often think
of, with sympathy, and am truly concerned to hear so poor accounts
of as to the bodily suffering, but if patience, be given, I believe all
will be well with her, I am not at this time able to express
what I feel for this dear suffer'r, but believe, and also wish that
I may be made sensible that it is at times profitable,
I write this in haste as I have this evening got a
free cover, and the post near going out, so shall conclude
with dear love to thee Wm: &c - also to Susy Bewley
Thy Affectionate Cousin
