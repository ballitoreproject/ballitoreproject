Dear Cousin
R. Shackleton/
Tis a long time since I received thy last Letter & have not I think writ to thee since, my Silence proceeded not from an inclination to decline a Correspondence with thee which I honour & esteem a valuable Favour -- I frequently read over thy kind Letters with a particular pleasure, & am glad I am noticed & remembered by such kind Relations. I saw, sometime ago, an Irish Friend who told me of thy Mothers Death, William Birkbeck also told my Husband when at Settle he had received a Letter from thy Father or thee, in which my sister & self were remembered, but still I should like to hear particularly how you all are -- I think of you daily & shoud be glad to be personally acquainted with you all but distance forbids me to indulge that hope -- My Husband is abroad, my oldest Daughter is at Settle on a visit to my Sister at Morris Birkbecks, she went to stay a week or two but has now been near four Months, her Father went to bring her home twice, but our kind Friends at Settle thought a longer stay would be of service to, & improve her, so he left her amongst em very willingly, they are worthy kind people I cant think or speak of em but my heart fills with gratitude & esteem -- myself & other 3 Children are thro Mercy in good Health, my Son about 10 years old has gone to the grammar School near 2 years, I prevailed upon the Masters to take him before he was fit to go & much sooner than they are obliged to admit em -- there is now no other school here for Boys of any kind -- he is but a tender Child but very active & I think him quicker at any thing than his Book tho his Master tells me he is very diligent & a very good Boy he writes prettily considering he has but a month in a year besides his little Exercises to improve himself in I hope if we all ^he & I^ live till he is of a suitable Age to get him out an Apprentice to some good Friend his Father seems inclinable he should be with a Friend -- & allows me to take both him and his sisters to meetings with me & tho he obliges me in that, a very tender point, yet my dear Cousin I dont live exempt from Trouble & Uneasiness, I meet with some hardship at times on some Accounts -- nor am I perfectly happy -- tho things might have been much worse with me in many Aspects -- I want not the necessaries of Life, indeed I endeavour industriously & do my best towards a Livelihood & it gives me much greater pleasure as I am yet favourd with Health & Ability to do something in my Family & Business than to be indolent & useless, & notwithstanding the want of my left Arm I can do surprisingly, & many things which might be thought almost impossible, I can sew a little, knitt well & pretty quick, make a pen with ease, iron our Linnen tolerably, & I do almost every part of Housewife work as well as some women who have both Arms -- my Deficiencies sits light & easy on me, I seldom think of it & when I [paper cut] I find I have far greater reason to be thankful than murmur -- We have heard lately from my poor Brother but fear, by his Letter he is still unsettled I believe I may have told the in a former Letter that 2 of his Children died near together in the smallpox his oldest is still living called after my dear Father, he is a sweet mild tempered Boy has a fine Genius for Learning his Mother takes Care of him, & he seems to want for nothing, but is kept very genteel & goes to the Grammar School -- hers is a high Family, & they seem fond of the child -- but dont care he should come near either my Sister or me or any of his Fathers Friends -- last third Day the great circulating yearly Meeting begun at Kirkby Lonsdale a Town in the Road from Settle to Kendal in which I believe there are no Friends it ended last Night -- a Leeds Friend in his return has just told me it was an exceeding large Meeting the place fitted up for the Occasion would not near contain the people -- S. Fothergill & several other publick Friends were there; please to remember me affectionately to thy worthy Father & Spouse, to thy Aunt Bernard (if living) & to thy own Children & Sisters son. I desire to be favoured with a Line from thee when thou hast time to inform me how thy Father & you all are -- I am with great respect thy affectionate Kinswoman -- E. Dale

P.S. excuse all errors tis long since I attempted to write correctly, Ive been frequently interrupted now & un used to write, ^almost^ at all but to my Sister, or now & then in the little way of our Friends my attention being ^mostly^ engaged other ways --
