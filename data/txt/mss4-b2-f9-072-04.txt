My dear Cousin,
	+++ At Mountrath I first heard of the translation of dear James Morton -- now I doubt not a member of the Church triumphant in heaven, as he was (I believe) an honest, faithful, diligent member of the church militant on earth, where he drank of his cup of suffering as his great Master had done before him, & as all those must ^do^ who will be so honoured as to reign with him hereafter. The Apostle, the experienced Apostle expressly declared, Yea, & all that will live godly in Christ Jesus, shall suffer persecution. Why then should those, whom the Lord hath visited & called expect any other? They will & must be hated & despised by the world, being chosen out of the world, & having no fellowship with its spirit. ++
	I wish dear cousin William & Peggy may continue to be under the gracious protection & direction of Infinite Wisdom, who knows best what is best for them, & where to plant them a family ordered by his counsel, & by their lives & conversations shewing forth his power praise. They may perhaps see little in the light of Truth about the matter, & think that their migration is not of such consequence, that they should expect any extraordinary discovery in the case -- yet if they act according to the best of their understanding, in that wisdom which dwells with prudence, are no way uneasy in their own minds as to the steps which they are taking & move in humble fear, feeling after the divine blessing on all their conduct, there is no doubt but all will be well. +++
	It is humbly to be hoped that the eyes of mankind are rather opening in these & other countries, to see somewhat farther into the nature & spirit of true & genuine Christianity. The Lord Almighty (if it be his will) hasten the day of deliverance, which the generality of people have great need to experience, from the thraldom of sin, ignorance & superstition; that the ^place of his^ footstool, as well as of his throne may become glorious! & may He, by the effectual visitations of his holy Spirit, cause, in a more general way, a return of the backsliding professors of his most precious Truth. ++ Thy truly affectionate kinsman.
