It may seem very odd to thee to be thus addressed
by me, but I am encouraged to it by a belief that thou
wilt not take it ill. - I would not wish to grieve or vex
any body in the world, but I would indeed wish that all
might come to the knowledge of the Truth & be saved.
Thou hast been the companion of my mind so long, that
at length I thought I would venture thus:- no creature
knowing of this but myself.- Thou knowest undoubtedly
that [deletion]that[/deletion] [insertion]thy[/insertion] character has suffered in time past, the
tongue of slander is seldom at rest,- who has escaped
a lash of it?- I know not whether thou wert altogether
guiltless or not:- but this I know, that we cannot
live too circumspect a life, considering that our immortal
part must bide the consequence of our life here:
therefore, dear Ben, let us bestir ourselves, for our
gracious[deletion][/deletion] creator is not like man, He is merciful &
compassionate beyond conception:- & surely we have great
encouragement handed us in the scriptures:- the poor
Prodigal son, how he was received:- as also those who
came late into the Lord's vineyard, ah read those two
passages with attention, the 15 chap: of Luke & 20th of Matthew.
I do not desire to stretch this out to a great length,
I only wished thee to know a little of my mind &
[deletion]I[/deletion] am with sincerity thy real friend.
