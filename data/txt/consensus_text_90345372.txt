to pay visits at Monkstown. A cattle
show was held to day at Bray, to which
Papa sent Capperkelrie, and I believe
Augusta and her calf, the former
I think was the second best in the
show. Philip went to it and staid
for the dinner, to which Papa went
also. Lord Monck was not there, he
has lost his brother Captain the Hon W Mou[unclear][/unclear]
has lost his brother Captain the Hon W Mon[unclear]ck[/unclear]
who was one of those "killed" in the
battle of Alma. Lord Meath headed
the table I believe and spoke in a very
gentlemanly manner. There is
another account now in the papers
of a[deletion]n[/deletion] second great fire, at [underline]Memel [/underline]
which has destroyed a great part of
the town. Avy has a cold to night.
