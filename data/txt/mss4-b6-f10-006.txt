Dear Mary
There are some circumstances wch. induce me
to wish thy husband's attendance at their next M : M
not on my own acct. as their whole proceedings respecting
us - seems no more than the drop of a bucket
We feel comfortable & easy in our minds & no [unclear]condemnation[/unclear]
attending at wch. I am sure thou wilt Rejoice
tho' not perhaps uniting with us in all our supposed
whimsies as some are pleased to call them - The
sun of this society (I believe) is most assuredly
set - and will not rise whilst one stone[deletion]s[/deletion] is
left upon another of the present dead System
form is good formality hateful - farewell
Dear Mary saith thy old friend
