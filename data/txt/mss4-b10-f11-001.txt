Glendruid November 14th 1823
Dear John
I received your letter by my father, I hope you will
come oftener out here after Christmas, than you [deletion]were[/deletion] [insertion]did[/insertion]
before it we are going to get the Monitor box out here
but I am afraid that here will not be many [deletion]things[/deletion] [insertion]papers[/insertion]
in it, I hope I shall mind what you said in your letter
I often make a great many [deletion]things[/deletion] promises to myself,
about myself, and think I will mind them but I
dont know how it is, but I go back to my old way again.
I think I should like to learn Spanish better than
Italian now, because after I knew that pretty well, while
Mr Keightly is here, I might learn some of the other
with the help of Eliza or Lucy, Mr Keightly says that
Spanish is a much easier language to learn than the
Italian, but that is not the reason I wish to learn it.
My Mother, Lucy, and I went round the glen yesterday to
try how long we would be walking round it, we were
twenty five minutes walking it but not very fast
Lucy got into the boat to day along with Manliffe

18th we were sitting in the parlour to day about one oclock
when we heard great bawling, we went out and found
that there was a man stealing the clothes, he had a
bundle of several sheets and table cloths tied up together,
when Elly Wolfe happened to see him, and he
made of, there were several men working out in the
road, and they ran after him, several then joined them
at last they caught him up in the six acres, they brought
him down, and they wanted to know what they would
do with him, so at last they took him down to
Mr [unclear]Dwire's[/unclear], and he was not at home, and Miss
[unclear]Dwire[/unclear] begged they would let him off and so they [unclear]did[/unclear].
22nd I sometimes go on thinking of some subjects such
as what you said about the leaves changing, until I
get more and more perplexed about it, I sometimes
think of myself in the same way. [deletion]I have just[/deletion] but
perhaps [deletion]you[/deletion] you think I am talking nonsense.
I [insertion]have[/insertion] just finished the Adventures, I like it very well
I think I almost like it as well as the Spectator
only, it is in but two volumes; I have not begun Italian
yet, I dont know why, only I suppose it is because
Mr Keightley thinks I dont know French well enough [insertion]yet[/insertion]

I am sorry we are not going into town this winter, I
have read that it is better always to look on the bright
side of objects, and perhaps it will be pleasanter than
we think. We saw a Will of the Wisp to night on Shank
hill, it danced up and down for a while, and sometimes
seemed to blaze up, til at length it disappeared,
they say where they are seen the place is generally
boggy, and I dont think there is a bog where we saw
it, I wonder how it dances up and down so, or where the
light comes from, [deletion]does it formed[/deletion] has it any thing to
do with Gas, or electricity, the first part of this until
the 22nd was written after I received your last letter.
I dont think this letter will give you as much pleasure
as yours gave me. Farewell yours
Emily
