I think my dear Friend, there is scarce
a request that you cod. make of me, that I shod.
not be highly gratified in complying with,
save [underline]that[/underline], which you now so flatteringly require.
My Impromptu has no merit, but in your
partiality; & I am infinitely too proud willingly
to expose myself, - You would always look on it
with the eyes of friendship, but it might perchance
fall into the hands of others, who wod. marvel at
my folly, & at your partial judgement; & thus,
my dear Friend, I might draw down on you,
some degree of that contempt only due to myself.
Excuse me therefore, that I return a negative to
that which you so kindly request. I heartily
with I deserved half the obliging things you
profess to think of me,- but alas! my Conscience
refuses its assent to your opinion. You have,
with peculiar grace, reproved the Capt: & myself
for speaking harshly of [deletion]your[/deletion] [insertion]any[/insertion] Friend of yours,—
We certainly had no personal acquaintance, &
judged only from popular opinion, & events;
this, on our part, was wrong,— the former, is often
erroneous, & to draw conclusions from the latter is generally

illiberal. [underline]He[/underline] alone, who knows the [underline]motive[/underline] for
acting, is the proper judge — at any rate, it was
uncivil in us to oppose your defence of one
whom you Esteem'd — I never heard but one
opinion of Lady Martha — that she is a most
amiable Woman. I know I am too apt to
express myself warmly on all occasions, but
I am persuaded you will forgive me —
I would not have your Bro. or any of his
Family, suppose we conversed on a subject,
which truly interests us both. I conceive
the Washing day is a parody on Thomson -
many of the lines are entirely his —
Will you bestow on us a peice of Carpeting?
ours is so dangerously ragged that I dare not
lay it down, & the Weather reminds us that
a covering to our floor would be comfortable.
Betsy is much better - You make me
blush when you speak of "distinctions in life" -
I know of none which shod. prevent your saying
whatever you wish'd to me,- & I am sure I shod. sincerely
regret were it otherways — feeling as I do,
that I am Yrs. very affectionately [unclear]JW[/unclear]

Mrs. Leadbeater
