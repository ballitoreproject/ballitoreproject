Richmond 21st of 10th month 1827.
My dear Sarah -
Fortunately a frank enables me to write
thee or I suppose I should be continuing to put off for a [unclear]forth[/unclear]
longer - I am grown a sad correspondent - indeed I have been[unclear][/unclear]
to write to thee this month - though I have been apparently [unclear]...ful[/unclear]
of the art. - Ah! it is so much more easy to think than [unclear][/unclear]
how easy it is to chat. - when shall we enjoy a cozy chat
darling? I am longing to see the young ones particularly the
unknown - & for thee - to see Hannah Jane. who is a [unclear]fair[/unclear]
black eyed lassie in [underline]scut[/underline] clothes & boots. - I was determined
to have her in long clothes during the winter, so I docked her [unclear][/unclear]
& [insertion]she[/insertion] stands quite steadily & looks a great deal older in [unclear]con...[/unclear]
she put on her scuts the day she was 4 months old. Mary [unclear][/unclear]
trousers to day & Jose has left off frocks. - There is their [unclear]progr[/unclear]
My dear sister how I run on - as if I did not remember [unclear][/unclear]
I have not addressed thee since our last sore loss, which gives
lonely name of orphan. - our pleasant home is now indeed desolate
when I think how delightful it was seven years ago, [unclear]notwithstanding[/unclear]
many [unclear]relations[/unclear] which now appear to extremely trifling, & [unclear][/unclear]
had not borne them at all properly; for we had the kind [unclear]par...[/unclear]
the sweet countenances & pleasant conversation ever [unclear]ready[/unclear]
if we would only partake of their sunshine - oh how dear[unclear][/unclear]
are now those hours to our memory, when that dear mother [unclear][/unclear]
stores of her rich mind & delighted to see us partaking of its [unclear][/unclear]
all gone gone ! oh Ballitore is no more! I can hardly [unclear][/unclear]
of going there, & but for our darling Deborah - So [unclear][/unclear]
so settling at that Stradbally - how little I thought when [unclear][/unclear]
passed through that stiff [underline]piracantha'd housed[/underline] town [unclear][/unclear]
have such a tie there on my next "[underline]progress[/underline]". ([unclear]ride[/unclear]
visits to her nobles) I suppose he will make well [unclear][/unclear]
must be sadly lonesome poor fellow. - I was in [unclear]h...[/unclear]
[insertion]have[/insertion] built his nest, near mine - that at least two of [unclear][/unclear]
might cheer each other with their native notes. - I [unclear][/unclear]
to seduce Deborah to me for a while - for I am [unclear]fair...[/unclear]
one of my own own, but she does not incline - & [unclear][/unclear]
be our next visitor. - how different! . - Well [unclear]w...[/unclear]
but not a whit less gay. - no danger if we are left [unclear][/unclear]
health but we shall yet have enough - & will not [unclear][/unclear]
the sordid cares of money bear down the springing
employer Poole Gabbett - this will be pleasant news for thy aunt
Gough - How is poor Sally Barrington - I was very sorry to hear
of her being so very ill. Farewell dear Sarah for the present &
lest I should not be able to write more - give my dear love to
Edward & do not allow me to be long without hearing from thee
I inclose a few lines to you by opportunity to Deborah
& Ever very afftely. thine [unclear]LJ[/unclear] Fisher

[unclear][/unclear] if we give ourselves - or rather Care the habit of brow beating
[unclear][/unclear] we can never conquer the demon - "the canker of all joys" ask
[unclear]ard[/unclear] to sing that beautiful glee, & then follow it up with the
[unclear][/unclear]less beautiful "Begone dull Care" both prime favourites of mine
[unclear]sh[/unclear] I was by. Dost thou remember the night we prevailed on
[unclear]..sh[/unclear] I was by. Dost thou remember the night we prevailed on
[unclear][/unclear] to sing before my father & mother? - he sang "Oft in the Stilly
[unclear]Night[/unclear]" & "Cathleen" - I forget whether he sung any thing else for them.
[unclear]our[/unclear] mother was delighted. - I remember her speaking of it - when I was
[unclear][/unclear] her to bed afterwards. Elizth. wrote to me a most minute acct.
[unclear][/unclear] dear fathers death - it was comforting to me, to get it. - but dear
[unclear][/unclear] I could, at first, hardly bear the idea of being separated from
[unclear][/unclear] beloved parents in their parting hours. - I felt as if I could not
[unclear][/unclear] of it without screeching - now, & indeed soon, I was convinced
[unclear][/unclear]lection that it was much easier to me - & that all was - as it
[unclear][/unclear]ways, ordered for the best. - I was comforted by thinking that thou
[unclear][/unclear] with him - & had the consolation of doing something for him, -
[unclear][/unclear]dearly would I have prized that privilege. - which most probably
[unclear][/unclear] have been denied to me by one jealous mind - but it is
[unclear][/unclear] speaking of that scene that I should condemn.
The news of this morning is a note from Uncle James Fisher
that his [unclear]Affy[/unclear] has presented him with twin daughters. she
[unclear]children[/unclear] are getting on very well. - When our Hannah Jane
[unclear][/unclear] we got a congratulatory note from uncle James on the
[unclear][/unclear] "twins" & saying that James must [unclear]look thankfully[/unclear]
[unclear][/unclear] when they came in pairs. - We may return
[unclear][/unclear]liment now & with more truth. - When shall
[unclear][/unclear] thee - art thou still in the country & how is the chine
[unclear][/unclear]ine have not as yet taken though it is all round
[unclear][/unclear] of Johnny from Deborah - I have a little cloth frock
[unclear][/unclear]now not of an opportunity. Is Margaret grown very
[unclear][/unclear] sort is Eben - & is his name also Edward -
[unclear][/unclear] & is he still the handsomest of the flock?
[unclear][/unclear] little of thee of late. - how art thou off as to servants
[unclear][/unclear] today, who had lived servant to Dunne of Kilkea
[unclear][/unclear] very well - he also lived with Counsellor OConnell.
The child's maid I got instead of Rose is very agreeable
[unclear][/unclear] not having got poor Rose - she might have tried
[unclear][/unclear] raised this one's wages, & these would have fared as

well. - Deborah is [unclear]rearing[/unclear] a [unclear]Book[/unclear] for thee, I think. - she would
do the same for me - & if she would do it until I had a [unclear][/unclear]
cancy I would like it well - but at present our establishment
is most comfortably filled, - except our cook is going, & more than
4 we do not want. - Men sevants are a plague - this new
one is the fourth since the beginning of the year. - The first
was a professed drunkard - the second beat the Cook - the
third was a dandy & would not work nor clean the horse he
loved playing the flute better & now we are in displeasing
uncertainty. - I had resolved never to have another but my
father & James were quite taken with this one. - There's for our
menage - tell me of thine. I enclose a ticket which was given to
Sally when coming home that she might get the money here
but lo! they say here she must get it at the office in Dublin
would thou ask Edward to try for it, for we may as well
have the money as the coach people. - Sally was most of the way
alone & never had more than one companion during the day
not to think any more about it - at any rate Sally sends him
her love & thanks. - Advise me what to get for a winter bonnet
& mantle or pelisse - which - I want both nice - what
is velvet a yard for a bonnet - & would a dark cloth
mantle with a velvet bonnet of same colour be "the go"
or would a bearer of best kind be cheaper. The gown
thou got dyed looks elegant - I got some to match for
a body & sleeves. I write with Hannah Jane on my
a [unclear][/unclear] & sleeves. I write with Hannah Jane on my
arm which must plead for the bad scratch -
what a queer jumble of a letter this is? - now the lady is gone.
I am almost run dry. - How do Richard & Elizth. get on & where
do they live? How are thy mother & sisters? is Matrimony stirring
amongst them? & how is John? - don't say "dished" or "diddled"
Eliza Gough was asking would a beginning School take in Limerick
some think it would & some not - I think it would, provided she
did not confine herself to friends & has a good method. Josiah
is very agreeable - more free than of yore. & is greatly prized by his
so that she is entitled to the
difference if to be had. - but
Edward is not to trouble himself
much only a little, & if denied
