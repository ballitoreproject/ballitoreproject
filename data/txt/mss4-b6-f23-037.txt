The Martyr
Thou man of virtue hast no cause for dread
Should this rich couch become thy dying bed:
Thy stainless life, with deeds of mercy fraught,
Enforcing what thy pious precepts taught,
Bids even thy humble heart aspire to [deletion][/deletion] see, 5
With hope & joy the crown prepared for thee.
And yet it seems as though thy labouring breast
[insertion]Were[/insertion] [deletion]Is[/deletion] with a secret sense of grief opprest,
Can friendship [insertion]yield no[/insertion] aid [deletion]thee[/deletion]? - Wilt [deletion]thou[/deletion] not impart
To friendship's ear the sorrows of thy heart? 10
It was not guilt which struggled thus within
A mind delivered from the snares of sin,
Yet of the past across that ransomed soul
A dreadful recollection sadly stole,
And, ere the latest pangs of death began, 15
Thus spoke the venerable dying man.
"Long has it been my wish the truths to prove
To fellow mortals, of redeeming love,
Those awful truths deputed to declare
Faithful I laboured with a Pastor's care. 20
To our assemblies oft a maiden came,
Devout her manner, graceful was her frame,
But veil'd so closely that the curious eye
Could not one feature of the unknown descry;

Yet that expression [insertion]which[/insertion] [deletion]to[/deletion] her face denied, 25
Methought her mein, her air, her gait supplied
Heaven seemed o'er every movement to preside.
The stranger came, [insertion]as oft[/insertion] [deletion]& she[/deletion] returned alone
But whence she came, whither returned unknown.
Time glided by, one evening to my home, 30
I saw, [insertion]with caution step[/insertion] [deletion]I note it well[/deletion], two strangers come,
Men who of gentle birth [insertion]blood[/insertion] appeared, but stern
and on their aspects grief I could discern
With earnest speech & agitated air,
They prayed me that with them I would repair; 35
A Lady who the doctrines [deletion]that[/deletion] [insertion]which[/insertion] I taught
Had heard & followed, now my aid besought;
Her hour of death was near - that hour of dread,
She begged to see me ere her spirit fled.
Could I refuse? - I could not - & around 40
My eyes, for such their will, a scarf they bound.
Whirled in a chaise through many a street we past,
And in a sounding arch way stopped at last.
Doors oped, & closed upon us, while we trod,
Silent, mysterious, through some lone abode,
Then, while a lamp blazed bright, the scarf removed,
My eyes around a spacious chamber roved
Where all was well arranged, & fair displayed -
There, on a couch reclined a lovely maid.
I saw the maid! - I started at the view - 50
For well that form, that mien, that air I knew.

Her face unveiled no pale disease exprest
By rosy health each perfect feature drest;
Yet grief sat heavy on her polished brow;
And her fair bosom throbbed with swelling wo. 55
thus spoke my guides - Our sister here behold,
Apostate from our faith - in error bold:
We are of Abraham's ancient faith - but she
Has heard thy doctrine, & is warped by thee.
Tried & condemned for this, her death is nigh, 60
A dreadful death! - by stoning doomed to die.
Yet [deletion]all[/deletion] [insertion]she shall be[/insertion] forgiven if she [deletion]her crime[/deletion] repent,
Oh save her, & this dreadful death prevent.
[insertion]Thou could[/insertion] [deletion]Thy words[/deletion] persuade - her judges can forgive,
Plead with her for her life, bid her return & live. 65
Then from the couch the weeping maiden sprung,
And, prostrate, round her brothers knees she clung.
Oh loved, for ever loved, though thus severe,
This pious man & your sad sister hear.
Oh let these truths divine your bosom melt, 70
Let me explain what from those truths I felt,
and let not zeal your [deletion]bosoms[/deletion] [insertion]hearts too[/insertion] rashly move,
hear Nature's voice - oh hear the God of Love.
No mercy - be silent - a short space we give
Thee to reflect - to him to bid thee live. 75
Frowning they past away - while from her [insertion]face[/insertion],
Faith, hope & love beamed forth with heavenly grace,
and thus, could those[deletion] with eyes[/deletion][insertion] I love[/insertion] awakened see
That holy gift of grace vouchsafed to me
Mary

Then joyful would I close in death mine eye, 80
Even now I joy - in Christ's pure faith[deletion] I[/deletion][insertion] to[/insertion] die.
She spoke - then ceased her voice of silver sound,
and solemn silence settled all around:
It seemed as if her spirit upward soared,
and mine beheld her transport & adored. 85
The dark-browed brothers now [insertion]appeared[/insertion] [deletion]returned[/deletion] again
In vain we reasoned, we implored in vain
They heard, with grief, with anger & disdain,
and led away the victim of their zeal -
Oh could fraternal bosoms cease to feel! 90
Returned they brought me to the fatal room,
The lamp burned dim, sepulchral was the gloom.
I feel as if the [deletion]sight I [/deletion][insertion] scene were present[/insertion] still [deletion]beheld[/deletion].
Which all my secret soul with horror chilled.
The beauteous martyr laid upon a bed 95
a linen covering oe'r her limbs was spread
Her eyes were closed - resigned she seemed to wait,
With holy calmness her approaching fate,
For piles of stones around the chamber stood
Ah soon to redden in her guiltless blood 100
Now turned on me the wrathful brothers eyes,
I saw, I felt their fiery passions rise
[deletion]They bade me, lest their vengeance I should share,[/deletion] [insertion]They bid me if my precious life I prize[/insertion]
[deletion]Their sister's destiny, their feelings spare,[/deletion]
[deletion]and neer[/deletion] [insertion]Ne'er to[/insertion] disclose the secret of her death 105
Till I revealed it with my dying breath,
They claimed a solemn oath, my faith to bind,
Else was [deletion]her dreadful[/deletion] [insertion]like[/insertion] fate [insertion]which has[/insertion]for me assigned.
I saw I could not save her [deletion]life[/deletion] [insertion]&[/insertion] I swore
Then [deletion]led[/deletion] [insertion]brought[/insertion] by them repassed the accursed door. 110
Upon my eyes the scarf again was spread,
And to my home, a mourner, was I led.
Oh martyred maid, who thus obscurely died,
Has not thy [deletion]precious[/deletion] [insertion]guiltless[/insertion] blood for vengeance cried?
No - by thy blessed Lord's example taught, 120
Thou wouldst implore forgiveness for the fault.
Methinks I see thee on thy seat divine,
While morning stars together sing & shine
My raptured soul [insertion]ascends and flies[/insertion] [deletion]springs forth & longs[/deletion] to 124
mix with thine!
I feel as if that scene still present were
That fatal scene of horror and despair.
