My dear Mother,
some account of our procedure so far, now
may add that we are favoured to get well home
& to find the family in good health, & very comfortable;
we rose early at S: Haughton's & got
to Royal-oak about the 8th hour, there met
a Kilkenny Carriage returning, which had come
this morning & hired it back for 1/2 far, [deletion]stopped[/deletion]
at Kilkenny, [deletion]where[/deletion] I purchased a large fine
pair of blankets at the Manufactory & brought
'em home in the carriage with us, so on to
nine-mile house to dinner [insertion]then to Clonmel[/insertion], saw my dear
Husband in the street, & met the children
at the door, all in great joy. Uncle Benjamin
finely recovered, company lodging with us, being
Assizes time, Tommy Jackson one of them.

I wrote to thee from Carlow, giving

+ for: L1:18:a

I should have told thee I paid several visits in Carlow
& drank tea with Cousin A: Haughton, paid
a visit after tea [insertion]to[/insertion] Debby Bayly. I made enquiry
of Hackett at Royal-oak for Samuel's
coat [deletion]for Samuel's coat[/deletion], which he soon produced,
said one of the Men had it, & that it had been
in Ross since I saw it, I told him thou recommended
me to him, as an acquaintance of thine
thou could depend on, & he expressed much regard
for thee & the family at Ballitore, I found
he had not heard of the Coat till my
application, so cannot tell whether the driver's
intention was honest or no, however, I have
the Coat, no worse than I parted it I
think. My Husband joins me & the children
in dear love to thee, & the two families, including
our dear Samuel
My head is so confused after the variety of
objects

objects all day presenting that I make repeated
mistakes, for my ideas are scarcely enough
collected to remember what time I got in
the Carriages tell I make a pause to remember.
However I remember how pleasant
my visit was to you; often anticipation is
more pleasant than the reality, but this
proved the contrary, for it exceeded expectation.
I remain thy affectionate daughter
Margt. Grubb
