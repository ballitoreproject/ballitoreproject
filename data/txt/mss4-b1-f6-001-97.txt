I require that thou wilt take immediate & effectual measures
for the discharge of thy bond & not let me be
thus made a prey of - & I shall with much pleasure
& gratitude acknowledge thy honour & kindness in so doing.
I have very pressing occasion for the money, having lately
given my daughter Mary in marriage to a worthy
young man (Wm. Leadbeater) & been obliged to take
up money at interest to pay her portion - Indeed I
had some thoughts of transferring thy bond to him in
part of that portion, as he was bred to the law and
served an apprenticeship to an Attorney - though he
has since joined our religious society, on the ground
of sober conviction & inward persuasion. I repeat my
request that thou wilt have the bond discharged without
further loss of time & write me immediately on the subject
Thy friends here join me in hearty good wishes for
thy health & happiness of which we should at all
times be glad to hear, & I am. Dear Robert
thy sincerely affectionate friend
Richd. Shackleton
