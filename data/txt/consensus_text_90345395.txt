x 2nd.. They came out to dinner. Papa,
Mama, and Joe who looks very badly.
No better account of poor Elizabeth.
3rd.. Papa Avy and I went to meeting
and brought back Charlotte Strangman
Papa went to town to enquire for Elizabeth
but brought out a dull account. Avy
and I spent the intermediate time at
Aunt Elizabeth's: We called at Glendruid
saw Grandmama, Uncles M. and A, and
Aunt Martha. This was a blowing showery
day but not cold. No letter from Polly.
x 4th.. Had a letter from Polly saying they had
gone to Belfast to the quarterly meeting where
they had seen Jos Pim. I think Polly
was unaware of the very critical state in
which Elizabeth still continues.
Charlotte went away by the three Â¼
train to Dalkey. Dr Wardy came out
to see Joe this evening. Mr Murphy
is not to come any more to teach Avy
till after Christmas.
