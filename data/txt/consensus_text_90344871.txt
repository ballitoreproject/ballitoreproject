the day - Before I came
in, Margt. told me Charlotte
Rieu called to see me with
her Aunt, it was rather
disappointing to miss her.
24 - Margt. went to meeting
but as it was raining I did
not go - The day continued
wet and I did not go
out, began very diligently
to learn some lessons &
draw, I wonder how long
I shall keep at it. John
takes all his meals with us
now during Elizabeth's absence.
I think it is very pleasant
to have his company, for
he has some life in him.
