I have still one thing in my favor, & that is an
old proverb, "better late, than never" - Indeed my dear
friend I blush at perceiving the date of your last kind
letter, & yet Thomas Wilkinson can bear testimony
to my not having forgotten you, nor thinking of you with
diminish'd Esteem & regard. He has promised to convey a
letter to you, & as I often have remain'd silent from the
mere want of a frank, I will now avail myself of his
offer - I shall rejoice to hear all your publications
have succeeded, so that you may be encouraged in your
benevolent wishes of aiding the rising Generation, by sowing
the seed of Rectitude in their minds - I am truly
glad to hear all my old friends are prosperous & well;
from your account, the Society at Ballitore is improved
by valuable new acquisitions, whilst all that was good
of the old remains, excepting the two excellent Bewleys,

the Editor. from the Learned I have received gratifying
accounts of the work, & it sells rapidly, - which I did
not expect. Have you ever seen the last Edition of
the Fragments, containing nearly one third more, than
the former Editions, & with a print of the dear Author?
it is both publish'd in 2 Vols. (Klopstock forming the 2d vol.)
& also in 1 Separate vol. for those who may not wish for the

in time Mrs. Bowdler & I shall be enrich'd by it, but
at present new Editions are so rapidly demanded, that
we are still [deletion]in[/deletion] advancing Money to Printers &c &c -
& have reap'd no emolument whatever _ We do not find
any advantage by printing in Dublin, so that I believe
Mrs. B. has determined to have no more publish'd there.
I am extremely obliged to your friend Mr. Lefanu, & beg
you to tell him I should be happy to thank him personally
at Tent Lodge, if he should ever come near it.
Our excellent Thos. Wilkinson has had an unpleasant
seizure, which he considers as only Billious; I wish
he may be right, but I fear otherwise - however, whatever
it was, he is recover'd from it, he came to us after the

last Quarterly meeting, & appear'd tolerably well. there
never existed a worthier Being, & I sincerely hope he may
be spared to us! If you have not already got an Historical
Romance written by Miss Porter, call'd "Don Sebastian"
or the House of Braganza", pray get it, for I think you
will like it - I have been much pleased with a Poem
just publish'd call'd "Wallace or the fight of Falkirk" _
it is written by a Lady; & tho' not without faults, I think
possesses very great beauties. you must read it more than
[underline]once.[/underline] to enter into the spirit of it, & I feel persuaded you
will be delighted with the noble sentiments of honor,
patriotism, friendship &c nor will you be [unclear][/unclear]
with the variety & nice discrimination of Cha[unclear]racters[/unclear]
which the work abounds, - the personification of [underline]Second[/underline]
[underline]Sight[/underline] produced on me a striking effect! pray read this
Poem & give me your opinion. it is dear, being 25 
Books are now charged so extravagantly, that soon
I fear none but the Rich will read - I grieve to tell you
that the Major has a stricture in his throat, which is
deem'd incurable,- - yet it may continue years before
it proves fatal; & in the meantime, thank God! he feels
no pain, tho' the noise he makes in swallowing gives
to those around him, and idea of uneasiness -
