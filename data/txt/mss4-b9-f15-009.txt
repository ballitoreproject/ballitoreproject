Dear Sarah,
I have had it on my
mind this long time to write thee a few
lines, but something or other occurred to put
it out of my [underline]power[/underline] but not out of my
[underline]head[/underline]. - I should have sent the Chalmers
long ago, only that while I was away
Doctor Gordon took the liberty of sending
it to the North. - He has since gone
there himself "to get fat" as Aspen told
me. after his fever; when he returns he will
bring me Chalmers I suppose. - But apropos
of Aspen, - I had a craniological conversation
with him the other evening on
our return from the medical Society, I
began it by asking him his opinion of
Spurzheim: system, as I [deletion]am at[/deletion] have

been latterly enjoyed in studying it. He told
me he thought there was a great deal in it
but he did not believe in it entirely - he
thought him too fanciful - he informed me that
he has lately discovered a few more organs. -
He (Crpen) has received a letter from Edinburgh
from Joseph Humphreys, who heard
Chalmers preach. He lodges in Humphrey's
house - Kinnibrough is the teacher of the Deaf
& Dumb but perhaps thou knew that -
Crpen promised to show me the letter when
he saw me next - I hope an acquaintance
is springing up between us. - Hast thou read
any of the late debates in our parliament on
Capital Punishment & Prison Discipline. Buxton
bids fair to be a successor to Sir Samuel
Romilly in that department. - I have been
lately reading A Compilation from various
authors on the subject of the Punishment of
Death by Baril Mintoymn. It
culiarly interesting at this time, when the
subject is attracting so much attention. It
contains several debates in Parliament on
the subject, in all of which Sir Samuel
Romilly had a conspicuous part. It is
gratifying to hear his sentiments even now,
when we consider that his labours were
not lost, & that he tho' dead still
speaks, , What art thou reading now?
How does our friend [unclear]Fenclow[/unclear] get on?
The British Review has attacked the
Peace Society - I wish the attack had
been made by some [deletion] work b [/deletion] more popular
work, as [underline] more [/underline] good would be
likely to result from it, by bringing the
subject into wider notice. However, I
am in hopes that this stroke, tho' not
aimed with a very large weapon, will
strike some sparks out of the flints on the
opposite side of the question. Farewell at present
Thine T. F.
