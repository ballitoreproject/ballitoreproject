My dear Elzth
Edwd. seem'd satisfied that Ellison shd get
the house at 3/3 per week to take it as it was
I wish they were all set - Cath. Duffy's father
came here to say that he sent or was to send
Cth. on 7th day & that he gave her up to thee to
do the best thou could with her that he wish'd
she might be kept to her business & made
industrious & kept from bad company
I did not see him being out but he left his
message, her poor mother would be glad
if she knew to have her in such safe hands
when I think of all she did for her & all the
anxiety she suffer'd on her account on
her death bed I may say, I feel as if
the poor orphan in part belong'd to me & I
often wish'd I could have employ'd her about
the children, I intend to be on the look out
for Biddy I would like her greatly myself
but must wait to try if any change may
take place here in the mean time if a
place shd offer I will send thee word I spoke
to Richd. about the Stradbally girl so thou
need do nothing further about that
I think Eben looks very well I do not
think he is much troubled with dropsy
I suppose I am in for a bout of nursetending
as Johnny I believe is in the measles
& I expect nothing else but that Margt & [unclear][/unclear] will
take it ever thy SB
