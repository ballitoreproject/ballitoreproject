Dunkirk 4th of 6th month 1790.

My dear

	When thy letter was delivered to me at Rochester I durst scarcely venture to open it, expecting as I thought I must to appear to deserve from thee, a reuke for coming without thee, but instead thereof, it was written I found with a design to relieve my uneasiness about thee, & to comfort me in other respects  I apprehend by the tenour of it, that dear E. Pim has told thee of some conversation that passed between her & me & the difficulty I should have been under if thou had come to Dover without a friend who was sure of returning with thee to London  as I could not go with & afterwards forget thee  nevertheless I waited till after the coach left the inn, & had some running [?] to mistake [?] it  so that I hope the appointment was not broken on my part  If I had not been embarrassed I need not say that inclination as well as duty would have led me to have been at thy service more in London & wherever thou chose to go  how agreeable as well perhaps as something better might this have been to me  but agreeable times have not been much my lot of late  I have toiled & laboured to see my way homeward till I found that my impatience & anxiety answered no good purpose, then I got pretty quiet & I had quiet & satisfaction in going forward  this was the case pretty much at every stage  when I laboured to come at a fixed determination either to proceed or return then I was left without any judgment about it & I found it necessary to try again to be quiet & remain in doubt  thus I got on to Dover  & when the time of the departure of our dear friends came  I thought I should bid them farewell & went with them on board the packet keeping a boat along side to take me ashore here I wished with all the ability ^I had^ to be favoured to determine aright, being desirous to know what to do, & when the boat was going to leave the packet I found myself quite easy & satisfied to stay on board & did so  leaving my saddlebags & surtout behind  which I would not let go with the other luggage  I had a quiet & comfortable passage  but here my difficulties again returned & if I can but think it right to do so  I mean to return with the packet that sails tomorrow  thus my overtaking you will be uncertain  If I take this myself to Dover  I intend adding a few lines & losing no time unnecessarily in getting 
to London  I think it would be a comfortable relief to me to throw myself into your party & travel with just as you please not that I can say any thing is wanting to make this extraordinary company agreeable to me, but the case of my own mind, & tho ^as^ I have frequently thought I was resigned & satisfied whether to go on or return I wonder why I am thus beset with difficulties & embarrassments about it  My dear friend I had no intention of taking up thy time in this manner when I began, or engaging thy attention about a matter of so little consequence to [seal torn] but as thou seemed rather interested about me I have pretty freely written as it occurred & thou wilt the more readily excuse it perhaps on account of the addition made to it  We met J de Marcillac here  he had been waiting near a week We learn that a friend whose family was settled here has been lately killed by a whale on the south fishery his name was Coffin  Farewell my dear master with a sense of thy many & kind attentions to me I remain  J Beale
My dear love to E Pim & the families at Ballitore If I do not see thee before thy return  our company tolerably well save GD. who has the toothache

My dear uncle
	Being well instructed in christian combat with the natural enemies of the souls peace & those peculiar to young warriors, thou wilt wonder the less at our dear Joshuas conflicts before & since he left London. It is very unexpected to us to have him here from the resolution he formed of returning immediately from Dover  In a favoured, solemn opportunity at Richard Lows a few hours before we sailed R. Baker instructively expounded to us that passage of the wind (which bloweth where it listeth) being the director of all those who are born of the spirit & feelingly adapted it to J.Bs tossed situation of mind though otherwise than from the present opening an entire stranger to it  I am comforted in hoping whether he proceeds with us or not, the foundation for acceptable & extensive service is laying in the mind of this lovely plant & that he will be preserved from evil & baffle satans devices 
I have thought much of thee my dear uncle since we left London as also of our truly dear E. Pim beleiving [sic] that we have the fervent travail of your spirits for preservation; were it in line of best appointment that we had all been banded in this little embassy, nature would have been gratified & no doubt the work facilitated but since it did not fall out so, we may perhaps conclude the allotted portion of trial was, that amongst many other blessings we should leave you & all be separated to the work whereunto we are called  We had an exercising passage thro Kent but crowned by the above mentioned opportunity  Since coming to Dunkirk our spirits have been refreshed & mine more encouraged than since our arrival in England  Soon after we landed we found it was their weekday meeting & J Marcillac come, it was also a great holiday & the astonishing superstitious reverence paid to what they call the host displayed to us by a procession of many thousand people of the army corporation clergy & little children: [word crossed out] the worlds grandeur & the voluntary humility of the priests combined to declare the corruption & tottering foundation of the popish religion  O! the difference when we returned to a solemn [word crossed out] waiting for eternal substance  my heart was overcome in the renewed prospect abundantly confirmed that the Lord will work & none shall let it, that Dagon shall fall before the ark of the [covered by seal] & that the new covenant dispensation shall [covered by seal] farwel saith thine & E Pims truly affect[covered by seal] friend SRG

We find the friends of Dunkirk more consistent than we expected & very kind, sensible & hospitable We are unable to say how we shall be disposed of or when depart  Do write sometimes to us  such pilgrims as we often want a cup of cold water because often apprehensive of fainting  E Pims lines to Rochester comforted M.D.

[note margin p. 3]
There are but few of the men at home at present in this place  friends are likely to encrease many being on their passage from America, amongst whom are William Rotch, his wife & 2 children an affecting account came a few days ago of a friend who was on the fishery being killed by a whale  we have been to visit [note continues margin p. 2] his widow who seems a valueable [sic] solid woman * with whom we had a previous humbling opportunity of feeling & ministering consolation  The ^dear^ Americans salute thee & EP. I mean G & SD J Marcillac says that he has had several satisfactory interviews with the great folks at Paris
