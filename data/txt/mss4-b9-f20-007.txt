My dear Elizth
I'm afraid you will think us useless
not to have sent a second account sooner,
as one is [insertion]more[/insertion] easy after hearing the second account
than the first, we get on very well even as
to nursing which has become more tolerable
within these last two days the boy is very small
&very quiet we call him Edw Ebeneser
I was out yesterday to jaunt & hope to get to
Kingstown the latter end of the week to nurse
there in the pure air & quiet place,
& do Melesina's sweet tongue is silent
& she will never again charm with her
delightful pen, I could not help feeling
a pang when Edw told me of her death it
seem'd as if a dear friend were gone, so
nearly had her affection for our dear mother, bound
us to her, perhaps their pure spirits are together
now. - Elizth Barrington brought me good
accounts of you all & many loves, give

[insertion]mine[/insertion] to my aunt Sally & tell her that Elzth
deliver'd her kind message to me I intended
to have written to her before I took ill & acknowledged
the 9s/- which came safely to
hand but I was kept very busy [insertion]sewing for the children[/insertion] & have been
rather hamper'd about servants Is Bess
Brennan engaged to Sally Haughton?
You will blame me if I write any more so with
dear love to my father [insertion]to[/insertion] whom I dont despair of paying
a visit this summer for all my disappointments
I conclude thine SB
I recd to parcel for Lydia & mean to forward
it the first op:
Elizth Leadbeater
Ballitore
