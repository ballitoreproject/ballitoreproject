Madam,
Ballinagore April 11th 1825
I can scarcely express my gratitude for the highly
flattering letter you were so good as to write me on the 8th March,
which was not only most grateful to my own feelings, but gave
the grateful satisfaction to all the Ladies & Gentlemen connected
with the school. I now lose not a moment in informing you,
of the two most serious, and important steps that I have lately
taken: towards my salvation hereafter & future happiness in
this life. - As to the first, from the pains and instructions of
that most excellent Lady Mrs. Bonham, whom I shall ever esteem
and respect. I have on the 10th of March [unclear]Im.d[/unclear] before the Rev.
Messrs. Rillerton & Walsh, become a member of the Established Church.
and on yesterday morning in the Parish Church of this town
have been married in the presence of my friend Wm Telford,

to a Miss Wilkinson, the Mistress of the female school, a
most exemplary young woman with whom I expect much
happiness, she having a tolerable share of Education & most
excellent habits of cleanliness & industry. She is daughter
to the people with whom I lodged.
From knowing your universal good will to all.
mankind. I feel confident that I do not take too great a liberty
when I ask you to take upon yourself the unpleasant
task of breaking those matters to my Parents. I am fully
sensible of the great pain and concern it will give them,
however I think there is no person to whose judgement
and advice they will yield with more deference than to
yours. In taking the first step I certainly have not
been actuated by any but the purest conviction, that I
have been pursuing the dictates of a mind enlightend

by the Gospel: and as to the second, it would be useless to
ask their consent, being fully aware that I never could have
obtained it, to marry any other than a R: C.
You know, Madam, that I have always been an
obedient and dutiful son, but now that I am at mans estate
and just 25 years of age, I cannot be accused for judging for
myself [unclear][/unclear] as a future day when my Parents are [unclear][/unclear] you,
to what I have done, I shall feel gratified to see [unclear][/unclear]
of them who may wish to come to me, but I shall leave
it to your good sense to say, would it not be improper until
all angry feelings subside,
P. S. I am at present on
a visit with my Brother in
law, -- Ten miles out in the
country, I expect to return by next
Saturday. I shall expect the favour of yr reply.
I remain Madam,
With great respect to Mrs. Leadbeater
and family. Your most
obd. humble servt.
