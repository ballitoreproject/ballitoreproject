Ballitore: 30th of 6th mo. 1819
My dear Sarah,
I have just settled the Post Office accounts. Thy father got
home safe per coach [deletion]on[/deletion] yesterday. Sarah Meddlicott is come to the
Doctor's & looks more composed than I expected. Margaret
Bonham is expected at the Inn to morrow with her husband
son & servants. The Bride Sally White, the Maiden Sally White,
Hannah White & Waring are come. I am obliged for thine &
Deb's joint letter, received by thy father & her's & Eben's received this
morning. You all, including dear Mary, excel in the picturesque
The curtains are only run together, whether all joined I do not
know. The reason of my writing now is [deletion]to[/deletion] [insertion]a[/insertion] request from Anna
Taverner that thou would buy her some shell fish I [deletion]sen[/deletion] say
lobsters, crabs, shrimps & whatever else thou may think of on
the "shelly shore" Thy father says the Sumpter Mule will
bring them, I sent a letter by Dick Neville
to thee my dear S. but I suppose thou
wilt not wait for it. They are all to be

home on 7th day "delightful words!
I know not when words were so [underline]heart[/underline]
[underline]pleasing[/underline] to me. Of all things I would
wish to meet you but - I fear I cannot
no matter I will meet [insertion]you[/insertion] in the sweetest
dearest nook of earth after all your vales
& woods & foaming floods & sheets
of silver or gold. Now for real
homespun life. I was at Fullers Court
this eve Mick told me with many
strange oaths & interjections that
the horses have been drawing Bog
stuff to day & yesterday, gently, two
or three turns during the day twice
to day & three times yesterday. There
is no such thing as a lime Burner
to be seen on the premises. The
hay is in forwardness this evening
being fine [insertion]was[/insertion] of great service to it.
They have been turning the lime &
sand on Mt. Bleak I think he says
but he is obscure. The horses have also

will meet [insertion]you[/insertion] at Glen malour as first proposed &
also to bring some crabs in the carriage with
you lest the man would not be in time,
Your descriptions of Luggalaw are so exquisite
that you have almost brought us with you
but no part of the picture was so lovely
to me as when you fancied you saw Eben
& me on the bank. Farewell my dearest sister
think of me as I think of thee I will be
satisfied as that is always Ever ever thine
L.J.L.
Thou last not least indeed, my dear love
to my ever dear E.&D. Some would perhaps
think I [underline]wrote[/underline] too affectionately but
the heart speaks thro' the pen it is a
curious vehicle, & thou my sweet I will

never suspect thy L of double dealing
All join in dear love I am in a
terrible hurry & I know I forget something!
All well.
