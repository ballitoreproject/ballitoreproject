Dear friend
Mary Leadbeater
I know not whether in forwarding these
memories of any obligation I have redeemed
my pledge. My memory, of late far from
retentive, often leaves me in the lurch
& I must request the kindness of my friends
to prompt me to supply what I may
have unwittingly left deficient, & with
an equal freedom suggest their future
Similar wants. My late visit to Ballitore
in the retrospect yields me much
pleasant recollection accompanied with
Warm wishes for the welfare of your whole
family circle, & by which I [deletion]wish[/deletion] [insertion]desire[/insertion] not to be
forgotten.
I rem. thy affectionate friend
