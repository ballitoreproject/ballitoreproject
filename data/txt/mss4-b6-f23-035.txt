Edward S. Lees.
I stood
Dizzy with sickeness from first I stood
And
My heart died within me while
I view'd
That scene which still my mental
eyes survey
E'n her and bed the beauteous martyr
lay
With linen spother white was as cover'd o'er

I feel as if the scene I still survey'd
On her sad bed the beauteous Martyr laid
[deletion]Whil[/deletion] With linen pure & white was covered o'er
WIth linen pure & white was covered oer no more
That bed from whence she must [unclear]arise[/unclear] [insertion]no more[/insertion]
Say cannot frdship prompt thee
to impart
With threats of [deletion]dreadful[/deletion] import [insertion]dire[/insertion]
& words of fear
They bade me if I held my safety
dear
