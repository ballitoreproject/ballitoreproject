to proceed to the end of our journey; where the great plus ultra
will open upon us, where is no mixture, no sorrow, sighing,
nor sickness, but joy everlasting upon the heads of the faithful,
devoted, humble followers of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. ***
The close of the business last evening was the reading of the testimonies concerning
our late beloved Sarah (Robert) Grubb. It was a very solemn time.

Joseph Gurney Bevan read audibly and feelingly: Lewis Majolier stood
by, and looked on the writing as the other read, that he might the better
collect the sense of a language in which he was but little versed. When
J.G.B. had finished reading, L.M. asked permission to add his
verbal testimony, which he did in a few sentences, very explicitly, properly,
and feelingly. J.G.B. interpreted for him, sentence after sentence,
as the other spoke, in a very clear, intelligible manner.
The solemnity was great, the audience was very large, and I believe,
much pleased, and, I hope, much edified by the whole transaction
For my part I was favoured to feel deeply, and to mourn, as I would
wish, the Church's loss. So much for that bright star, now set for ever
to this lower world.
