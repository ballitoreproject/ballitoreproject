Ballievey to dinner - and staid the
night. Aunt Elizas eyes are still [unclear]troubling[/unclear]

Emmy and I took a pleasant walk

and there were no pathways - The
Mountains looked beautiful crested with
snow. E and I slept together

found only Mr Evans at home - Bessie

their departure - the latter on his
way to town . [deletion]The[/deletion]
