Met Jas W and Ellen Allen in the
train, both bound like us, for [unclear]De Vesci
lodge. This was a charming
day - indeed the whole week has been
very fine most fortunately -
After dinner we went to see two
French war vessels which are now in
Kingstown harbour, but being rather
late were not allowed on board -
However we had a very pleasant row in
the boat which was something.
In the evening there was a large party
of young friends to tea and we spent
it very pleasantly - Alfred Webb, James
White, and William Webb brother of Wilhemena
acted charades and so well, that we were
all in fits of laughter. oh! it was very funny -
Emmy and Fanny were there -
4 Sunday - Slept at De Vesci and returned
of us that Philip had to drive down the
car - and on our return we found
Uncle Arthur here so we had quite a large
party of gentlemen - i.e. - Uncle R. Leadbeater,
William Goff Pim, Uncle A, James White, TH,
and all the boys -
after meeting: there were so many
