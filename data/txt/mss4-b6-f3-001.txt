Lisburn July 14th 1810
I am very much disappointed indeed, my dear friend
at the thoughts of not seeing Deborah in Lisburn as I had hoped
to have a great deal of pleasure in her company - I do not
think I was ever more prepossessed in favour of any person than
I was the first evening I saw her & her innocent & affectionate
manners made me very much attached to her - She has noble
dispositions & I think an excellent understanding - I can
assure thee that I was not in the smallest degree offended
at thy not allowing Deborah to spend some time with us,
as I have always made it a rule thro' life never to take
offence when offence is not intended. I know very well how
much more she would be improved under the care of a
judicious & excellent mother than by staying with me,
yet if thou had permitted her to come I would have
taken a great deal of care of her - I was very much
pleased with the information my dear Betsy gave in her
last letter about Cottage Dialogues, as I think M Edgeworths
preface & notes will be a very great addition - I fear that
if W Lefanu ever sees me he will find me very different
from what my partial friends have represented me to be -
My Father has had a letter from Mr. Trotter since our return
home; he now lives at Mt. Alla Cottage near Wicklow - I pity
him very much, yet I think he has acted very improperly -
I do not think he will gain either reputation as an author, or
pecuniary reward for his literary labours - Yet his wish for
fame is not in the slightest degree damped by the ill success
of his former publications, as he is now busily engaged writing.
I fear he has too high an opinion of his genius; & self flattery
is very dangerous even to a strong mind. I have not heard
any thing of Miss Balfour since my return home except that
should prevent people from being acquainted with each other - It is not necessary
always to converse on the subject in which we know there is a difference
of opinion - The truth should be told at all times, but I cannot think it
necessary to tell all our thoughts unreservedly to persons that we do not
rank among our particular friends - Yet candor is such an inestimable quality
that it is better to err on this side than by reserve appear to hold
sentiments different from what we really do - Among my acquaintances [insertion]here[/insertion], (who
are composed of [insertion]persons of almost[/insertion] every religious sect) I would never think of introducing a conversation
on theology because I know that we should most likely differ very
widely, my Father & I have often conversation on some religious points
on which we differ - but I need not discuss this point at present as
my paper is too small [insertion]to contain[/insertion] [deletion]for[/deletion] all that I have to say -
Betsy Shackleton mentioned in her last letter to me that [underline]Immy[/underline]had had sent
a poem of her cousins for the Belfast magazine - My Father desires me to
return thanks for it & for all the papers you have been so kind as to send.
I have just read the proof sheet of [underline]Immy's[/underline] paper on Quackery -
I have sold eighteen of thy books since I returned home; I hope to get the
amount from the bookseller, & the money from Archer for 25 & send it very
soon - I intended to send some money for the gloves to J Chandlee as
Betsy desired but my Father thought of another plan of sending the money
which will save the expense of postage - He says that the beginning
of next month he expects Samuel Haughton will receive money from the

she wrote two very beautiful songs for the newspaper -
In answer to what thee says about my writing for the magazine
I may tell thee, that I had not intended to write more for a
very long time, partly because I have not leisure as thou
knows that the entire care of a house where we are continually
in the habit of seeing strangers much occupy a great
deal of my time; but I have a stronger reason than this
I write too much nonsense to let any thing of mine appear
before the public - & even if I could write sense (which I almost
despair of doing) my acquaintances here know almost all the
different writers, & I do not wish that they should know that
I ever wrote any lest they would think I was too vain and
presuming - I expect a paper will appear in the [insertion]next[/insertion] magazine
written by an English gentleman tending to turn the Irish
into ridicule. This paper may rouse me as I do not like to
hear any thing against the Irish - I admit we frequently
make blunders in speaking, but are not other nations equally
[underline]guilty[/underline] of this crime? I have such an enthusiastic attachment
to Ireland that I cannot patiently hear the Irish
censured without endeavouring to vindicate our national
character - I think that a love of our country, & a love of
home is the natural feeling of every heart. Campbell in
a little poem entitled a visit Argyleshire describes in a
very beautiful manner his sensations on visiting the place
where he had formerly lived - A feeling heart must always
have peculiar pleasure, altho' sometimes accompanied with
painful sensations, in [deletion][/deletion] reviewing the scenes of their
childhood - I suppose you were surprized to hear
that I called to see Ann Shannon as I was not acquainted
with her; but she sent me two messages requesting me
to call to see her, and I thought it would be very strange
if I would refuse to call - I was very much pleased with her -
I do not think that a difference in a few theological points
Carlow bookseller for the magazines & he will write to SH to pay Betsy
Â£2-10-. I hope thy sister SS has quite recovered; please give my dear
love to her - I shall always be rejoiced to hear from thee - I will have
compassion on thy eyes & only add that I am very sincerely thy affectionate
SH
