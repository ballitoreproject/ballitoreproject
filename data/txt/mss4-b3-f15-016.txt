Ballitore: 26/1 month 1792

Dear friend,

	+++ Of unspeakable advantage is it to have the heart strengthened by a solid, religious sense. - So, when trouble comes there is a place of refuge, a cup of consolation, an healing plaster for the wound +++
	We join thee (I believe) in lamenting that we cannot have more frequent personal interviews - perhaps, if tolerable health & tranquillity be lengthened out we may have more of that satisfaction. Old age brings on its infirmities & impediments - may it quicken, not deaden our attention to a diligent preparation for a happy final close of all!
++++		Thine affectionately
			Richard Shackleton
