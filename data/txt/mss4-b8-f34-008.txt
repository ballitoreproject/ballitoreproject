Ballitore 24th of 9th month 1794
Dear John,
Thou mentions in the beginning of thy [insertion]last[/insertion] letter that
I have been promising to do something for thee these 2
years past; & in the latter part of it thou says that
I have borne thee [unclear]up[/unclear] these 6 years past, now the
two sentences don't correspond at all, for promises wd.
never keep thee up, & besides I never made any one
promise [deletion]with[/deletion] [insertion]to[/insertion] thee that I did not fulfil, that I know
of - The last money that I gave thee expectation of thou
got about 3 months ago & the person who advanced it [insertion]for me[/insertion] has
not been yet paid, & if I remember right thou told
me thou had paid off the last rent, however be that
as it may I don't expect that paying this 1/2 year's rent for
thee will be of any real service to thee, for thou need
never expect to do well till thou does justly, & I think
thou hast not acted justly by me. I mean to lend thee
this 1/2 year's rent (7£..15s..7 1/2d) by giving thee an order payable
on or about the 1st of 11th month next in Dublin which with the
amount of thy account with me for these 2 years last past
makes £37..17..11 1/2 I wd. like to have thy Bond [insertion]or note for it [/insertion] lest thou
would

would forget thou had got the like, that added to the former
debt, principal & Int. will make it I think £159 - 10s
& that within 5 1/2 years to me is no small sum, [insertion]besides the last purchase money thou recd.[/insertion] & now
lest thou should imagine thou has the shadow of a
promise from me, from this forward never expect me
to advance any more for thee - Look back & see is it
not a shame that thou should be so circumstanced as thou
writes, so behind with thy rent, not have a horse, or a second
Cow, & to have a trade & a reasonable farm, & an income
of between £20 & £30 [insertion]a year[/insertion] [deletion][/deletion]
[deletion][/deletion]
[deletion][/deletion] [insertion]to be sure[/insertion] let one look into thy family & it does not appear
to be more comfortably provided for, than that of the man who
goes out to earn his Shilling a day, there must certainly, in
my opinion, be something amiss, & until an amendment
takes place in the right way & manner, it is in vain to
attempt helping thee I think - farewell
Wm. Leadbeater
