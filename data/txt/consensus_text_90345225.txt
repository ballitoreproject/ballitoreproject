Aunt Eliza, John and Elizabeth,
Margt, Philip, [insertion]Charlie[/insertion] Avy, Liddy, and I
Aby Shackleton, and Joe Strangman.
We were all seated in meeting
when the friends began to arrive,
which was very pleasant. Caroline
Bottomly was there and spoke very
nicely - The meeting was not
particularly short at all - Polly
spoke [underline]very well[/underline] also Thomas Henry.
After meeting we all returned
to the men's room - and then
there were congratulations and
[underline]kissing[/underline] [deletion]s[/deletion] &c &c - any giving of
gloves - In about half an hour
there was no sign of us there
I think for we had all gone
in our respective carriages.
Margt. Liddy, and I went to Glendruid
and Emmy back with us -
Well I think it will take me
too long to enter into every par-
and brought Georgina
