My der Francis & Lucy
We hope you will not refuse
what I am about to ask, Edw has taken
a great desire to have all of our family
that he can, here with us on Christmas
day & I write [insertion]I wasnt to my [unclear]ire'[/unclear][/insertion] to request that you will
come & bring as many of the children
as will be agreeable to you perhaps
Emily Reginald & Fanny might come without
much trouble - my mother & the boys
are to come & [unclear]Ms[/unclear] & Eliza if they are
home in time we hope R & E will also
come & Florence if well enough & I have
this day written to ask Mother, do you

we cannot do without you & you
must shake of the cares of the world
for a few days & join us we hope
to be as merry & happy as this
pleasant company can make us,
Do now make an exertion & come
if you can

My dear Frank & Lucy
As Sarah gave me this
sheet to send to the post I do not
like to do so without, (in my own
hand writing) joining in her request
that you will lend your aid to
a great meeting of the Barrington
Faction here at Christmas [unclear][/unclear]
To be sure many things may in
between this and that but however
if we are all spared in health of [unclear]Lady[/unclear]
[unclear][/unclear]. I have set my heart on
mustering our whole strength upon
that day, young and old as far
as possible. Dont spare a little expense
or trouble to let [deletion]us[/deletion] all that remain
of us be together upon my mothers
next [underline]birth day.[/underline] The year has been
trying & gloomy, and tho I am sure

we are all thankful for the [insertion]numerous[/insertion] Blessings
that have been granted to us, still
It will I hope not be [unclear]enough[/unclear], and may
in one way shew that we are sensible
[unclear]of them[/unclear], by having a little extra enjoyment
upon the occasion in question
with the compliments of this & that
Season and all other hearty good wishes
I remain
your affectionate brother
Edward
