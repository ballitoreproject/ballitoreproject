Madam.
I humbly crave pardon in taking the
liberty of addressing you in these few lines. I beg
leave to inform you that I am John Daily
that Served your Father for several years. I
have often waited on your Ladyship during your
celibacy near thirty years ago. And as forteen
frowned on me now. I have made bold to call to you
hoping you will be so kind as to get me some
employment from W. Shekelson or do something
for me in this my pressing and present necessity.
I have the Honr. to subscribe myself your most
obedient, most devoted ever obliged and humble servt.
June 19. 1820.
