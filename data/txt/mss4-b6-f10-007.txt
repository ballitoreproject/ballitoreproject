My dear friend,
I received thy little note, and have been often since
meditating a little answer - and now after the hurry & bustle of the Day
thought I woud try what hand I coud make of it - and indeed my friend
I very often feel the great loss I sustain by these perplexing things - which
so unfit the mind for the sweet enjoyment of friendship & friendly
intercourse with those we love - and from whose [insertion]communications[/insertion] I might expect and sometimes
have experienced real satisfaction - I have often looked forward to
the time when I may be enabled to burst these chains asunder and to claim
the valued privelages of a free born Irish-man - but then what is to [insertion]be[/insertion] done
with these little babes, who have been commited to our care in this
wilderness - the fable of the wagoner & Jupiter has instruction in it - there
must be some exertions used on our part - and indeed my friend I may
tell thee as a little secret - that notwithstanding the multiplication of
these little boys - I have never yet repented the means used for their production
[unclear][/unclear] my late marriage - I like to speak without metaphor to
a friend - and believe without the comforts of a faithful domestic friend
I shoud have been one of the most miserable animals in the world,
how then ought we to prize our privelages - and look I down wth. righteous
indignation on the herd of useless male animals [insertion]in[/insertion] whose cold & sensless
veins these warm emotions have never [insertion]vibrated[/insertion] [deletion][/deletion] to make another happy
believe I have gone on far enough to make thee laugh and should be sorry
[deletion]to say anything[/deletion] [deletion][/deletion] [insertion]to[/insertion] make thee cry - therefore shall change the
subject to our esteemed Cowper - I have got thro' the first volume the
fore part - I did not relish much especially those letters indicating in my
opinion strong symptoms of [insertion]gloomy[/insertion] enthusiasm & prejudice - owing perhaps [insertion]to[/insertion] the

delicate state of the nervous system & other grievous maladies to wch. his weak frame
was often subject - yet as we read on we find his exalted mind gradually emerging
from under this galling yoke and asserting the privelages of a poet & a free
man - most of his letters are instructive & entertaining, yet not without a considerable
alloy - they contain too many my dear sorry dearests, yet in him
perhaps sincere & pardonable - do not from these criticisms put me down
an ungrateful receiver of the favor conferred upon me, in the line of these
books, I acknowledge it in its full force - and shall be obliged when oppy
offers for the book containing the poem on his mothers picture -
I note thy pun on my library - tho' I am sure it was not meant so,
it is a very poor one indeed and contains very little but books of old
theology - these I have pretty much laid aside - and am now indebted
to my friends for the sight of allmost every curious publication
I read - [insertion]&[/insertion] [deletion]and[/deletion] read I must, while [insertion]light &[/insertion] sight is continued - it is my
chief relaxation - and shoud I live to see their little bearns able to [unclear][/unclear]
for themselves - have in prospect to spend my last days among
my friends, & my books - perhaps in Ballitore, I knew no place
I woud prefer to it - notwithstanding all your heterodoxy - I love
old lights & new lights - but not bigots of any sort - neither do I
heat them - but I heat bigottry in every shape & form
farewell dear friend 11 O'clock P: M
thine truly

Dear Mary yesterday I paid a visit to thy Sister Chandlee,
was pleas'd to see the house (as far as I went) look more comfortable
than I expected, I suppose the upper part is much
out of repair - believe I met a friendly reception, Debby seemed
pleasd to see me - & gave me expectation of their coming to see
us - she appear'd chearful & in good spirits - I thought grateful
for even this partial settlement - Greens son is to have
part of the house & to diet with them - which is not quite
what could be wished - but she seemed disposed to be contented
with their allotment & to make the best of every
thing -  Deb. Junr. not yet come - I look forward in hope
of some satisfaction in the society of a youthful female
friend - her Mother spoke very agreeably on this head, said
if Deb: was come she wd. soon run to see me &c &c -
I just scribble these lines, while my SH smokes his
pipe. thou may think me almost half asleep, from
the sort of scrall I have produced - bad as it is I
must send my love to Elizabeth & thy WL a large share
thy [unclear][/unclear] MH
tell Fanny Bewley - I [unclear]en[/unclear] of the cabbage

plants she wants from us, we wish to hear how she gets on, &
if any alteration appears in dear Susys [unclear]breast[/unclear] - perhaps thou
wd. kindly [unclear]???[/unclear] us -
