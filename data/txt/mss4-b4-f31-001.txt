begin to think we shall have you at lint _ Elizabeth
informs us that you have put off your journey until
Friday next - By that time [unclear]aprizes[/unclear] & meeting will all
be ours - both are in full operation at this present
writing - We have Dinah White with us alongside of
Sally - We could find room for you even now as we
are by no means thronged - Either our faith is not
strong or something is amiss but we have not had
a full house this time either at board or in bed. Anne
Murray & her mama are sporting away here & are to
give us their company tomorrow - Anne is the finest
woman at the meeting - I am particularly glad
you are coming just now as I want to talk to
you - Do you remember I owe you Â£5 - It should
be paid on demand with interest at 5 [unclear][/unclear] [underline] if required - [underline]

in the harbour if you arrive in good order to convey
you forthwith to this your destination - Your ww J.J.F
