It haveing been a time of long silence betwixt
us I now, take this oppt. to acquaint thee wth. ye reast of our
kind relations & freinds att Ballitore wth. our health & wellfare
wch now thorow ye continnewed favour of Devine goodness we injoy
at present & to have ye same acct, from thee of you all would be
very acceptable to us for not wth standing ye Distance that interposeth
betwixt us yet we ought not to let ye remembrance of each other be
buried in obliveion wch I can say has not been ye case wth me for
I have often thought of writing to thee of late but ye Low seituation
that my mind is often in togeather wth ye affares of my familey prevailed
wth me to Delay writing to yee before this & beliveing thou was not
unacquainted wth ye Death of our Dear Son Robt. ye Loss of whome
has been a Close [unclear]pince[/unclear] to his father & me but as we have no Dout of
his Etarniel well being so it very much helps to soffen that afflectio[insertion]n[/insertion]
for tho his years in this Life was not permited to be maney & even -
those attended wth. very sore tryels yet his patience was admierable
& we belive his reward is great - My houssband has had sum sharp
fits of ye [unclear]Graviel[/unclear] since yee was hear one very late[insertion]l[/insertion]y wch I think was
ye worst whilest it continnewed & since has parted wth sume small ston[unclear][/unclear]
so I hope he may be Clear of that feever Distemper for sum [unclear]time[/unclear]
pleas to let Cousen Abram. know that his bro. from York has
been this way he being one of ye frds. that came to our monthly
meeting to accomodate that Difference that was bewixt it and
Joseph Broad Bent wch. is now happley at an end he was well &
inquiered after you - thou may perhaps hear that our
neighbour John Aldom has been at Dublin & so think it negleigence
in us that we wrot not by him but he going to Leverpool
not Deisiering for your Nation but finding a ship ready he enbarked
& after a hassardous Voyeg of 18 Days he got to Dublin
whear he stay'd but 3 night so that we had no acct. by him of
aney of our Cousens [unclear]Masons[/unclear] save that Malloys conduct is not
yet to ye satisfactsion of his frds - I think hear is littel
alteration hear away since I writ last our Daughter Debey
remainer in ye saime way of busness & has hir Love to thee
& all inquiering irelations as Oppt. may sarve I belive Debora[insertion]h[/insertion]

mind then she was sum time since for she was happley
prevented [insertion]from[/insertion] Dying after ye same manner hir father Did

Daniel reseived a few Lines from thy Nephew who had been at
Ballitore wch presented thy Love to us wch we took kindly & that
thou intended to send me a piece of Irish stuff wch I would not have
thee to do not out of any slight or Disregard to thy present but
I know ye hazard is great & the oblegation I look upon none at all
So I Desier thou will Ommeet it at Least till thou come to England aga[insertion]ine[/insertion]

Dear Aunt
Mary Barnard
Considering the many obligations I am
under for thy past fabours I could not easily let this
favourable oppertunity pass by, without [deletion]giv[/deletion] letting thee have
a few lines from me, whereby thou mayst Understand I am
in Perfect health hoping these may find thee with the rest of
the kind Family partakers of the sam mercy; I receiv'd a letter
from Tho. Gelder without eit[insertion]h[/insertion]er time or place whereby thou desir'd
to hear from me wch. shou'd have done before this had not the
Great Tryals & Afflictions with wch. I with the rest of our family
have been Vissited with, on Accot. of my Near & Dear Brothers Death
wch. has been a great Tryal to me, but has it has pleased the lord
to take [insertion]him[/insertion] from ye Misery that has attended him in his Short but
Afflicting stay in this livfe; who knows what his best for us
& has I believe he Dyed with Great Symtoms of Eternal
felicity; it is not my place to m[deletion]o[/deletion][insertion]u[/insertion]rmur or repine at the hand
of providence, & that we who are left behind may be so prepared
when we come upon a Dying bed so as to be ready to [unclear][/unclear]
for the Final Change is the very Desire of my mind.

If Cousin Richd. [unclear]has any[/unclear] Intentions for England this next Spring
should be very w[unclear][/unclear]e to stay with us as long as oppertunity
would permit; I [unclear][/unclear] Newsworthy thy Information save
sad news that the [unclear]D[/unclear]per among Cattle rages very ill in
this kingdom b[unclear]e[/unclear] not visited these parts as yet but is ver[insertion]y[/insertion]
near us; it is curre[unclear]ntl[/unclear]y affermet that no less then 100,000
Cattle as Dyed of the same in Lincolnshire; and still rages
amongst them that are left; So this being the needful
at [unclear]prest[/unclear] Conclude with Dear love to the with rest of the
Affectionate family & all relations and friends as if nam'd
from thy Loving, & Affectionate Nephew.

makes my hands very Stiff & Numb.
Give my love to Aunt Martha
