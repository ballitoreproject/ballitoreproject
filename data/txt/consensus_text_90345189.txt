table a little note from Liddy informing
us, that she and Margt. had gone to
the Exhibition, and if we had no objection
to follow them [underline]if we came [/underline]
[underline]in[/underline], they would meet us at half past
one in the medaeval court, so seeing nothing
to prevent, after settling some of our
things, we set off, and I met them
in the said rendezvous[deletion]y[/deletion] - As they
hardly expected us in, they were
very agreeably surprised, and we
spent a pleasant hour & a half wandering
about together. The China attracted
I think most of our attention
for we spent a good while choosing
sets of tea things, and getting Polly's
opinion of them, now that she will
so soon need them in her own
house. We did not meet many
of our acquaintance, Willie Griffin
twice claimed to come across our
way - We expected Ellen to tea
but she did not come -
