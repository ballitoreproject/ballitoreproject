27 Monday - G - Lyd and I took
a very pleasant walk to Darlington
Glen where none of us had ever been
before - [deletion][/deletion] such gathering of
blackberries as we had - and we dined
off sandwiches on the grass under
a tree at the far end - I [underline]greatly[/underline]
enjoyed the walk
28 Tuesday - Today - Georgina
and I went down to Bray and
Lyd went out to ride - on her return
Georgina and I did so too [underline]together[/underline]
as Phil very kindly sent over his man
It was [underline]very[/underline] pleasant -
after dinner we then walked up
after dinner we three walked up
to Powerscourt House - escorted by
[unclear]Cha[/unclear] Garkin who was going to ask
a friend of hers one of the servants
to show us the house - It certainly
is worth seeing - the saloon is
splendid - the conservatories
also which have quite lately been
built - Cha came out to tea,
and Phil came over too -
