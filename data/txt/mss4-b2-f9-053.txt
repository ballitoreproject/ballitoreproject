Ballitore: 23/9 month : 1781
	
My dear Cousins agreeable Letter of 8th instant came to hand - I need not tell thee it was very acceptable - all thine are so to me, & I hope our friendship will not only last while we last, but descend to our offspring, & that our children will keep alive among themselves this cheering, animating flame - My wife & I had a few days ago an epistle from our dear friend James Morton - I return our answer inclosed, which request thou wilt forward to him, when opportunity offers - I leave it open for thy perusal, that I may not have the trouble of repeating the little intelligence which occurred to convey to him - Be pleased to seal it before delivery -
We are generally favoured here with tolerable health - my wife has had some cold, but is better - Our maid Betty Widdows being honourably married & gone with her husband to Rathangan, & our next help (Ally, sister to thy sisters Milly) having clandestinely eloped with a sort of Soldier-man who deserted, we have been rather hobbled. however we have one Stump of a Girl left, the kitchen-wench, whom I expect no body will run away with, either for her money, or her beauty, & she is aided & assisted by our two respectable Friends & domesticks, Nanny McConaughy & Molly Hudson; so that with the ^additional^ care & attention of our two daughters, we contrive to jog on - We hear often from Peggy Grubb - John Smithson lay there the other night on his return from the Quarterly Meeting of Cork - they were pretty well, but Peggy has been much hobbled too about servants - We were 21st instant at Meeting at Athy, dined with Debby - she seemed in good spirits - Abby wrote lately to thee - I think thy mother not quite so lively as as when we had her in Ballitore - We had Letters from Morris & Sally Birkbeck not long ago - they did not afford a pleasing prospect of her being likely to recover; yet did not altogether shut out hope - Probably thou hast heard of Ellis Chandlee of Cork, his wife & daughter having been captured by the French on their passage from Cork to Bristol, & tis believed they have been taken to France - I understand they intended to settle in England, & had taken a good deal of moveables, beds, &c. which had not been insured - its said that beside their loss, they suffered very rough usage from the Captors - Paul Abbot, who was on board the same vessel, found means to quit them & get to Dublin, from whence I suppose he is gone to England again - we are told that John Lecky of Youghal has been some time past very high in a fit of insanity, has taken to drink, & is very troublesome - Poor Edward Cooper has I fear ruined himself every way - he lodges at Joss Haughtons at Coopers hill, his wife & daughter at Wheelam - they say William is about to take a house in Dublin, & live ther with his mother & sister - Bob Clibborn is likely to succeed in his suit with Betty Morris, a daughter of the widow Morris of Cork, & Grand-daughter of John Lecky - John Smithson brought us word that Phebe Carleton was very ill, they feared an imflammation on her lungs - we have not since heard - She & James Lecky have lately by nomination sate in our Select Meeting - Thy account of Molly Phelps is very pleasing - Many good symptoms seem to attend her - She has chosen (I believe) the good part - it looks as though her faith & foundation would be closely tried - but Simplicity, humility, & godly-Sincerity will bear her out, if she abides with them - Poor Ephraim Boake has been talking to me several times of late about his unhappy, incestuous marriage - I suppose he & his wife are distressed about it - they have been brought low in body & mind - but whether they will ever find find a place of repentance, though they may seek it carefully with tears, is to me a matter of uncertainty - My advice to him was that they should not only not co-habit together in future, but not live under the same roof together, that ^so^ they might by their visible separation bear a conspicuous testimony to the world against their sin, & make thereby publick atonement for the violation of the general laws of nature & sense of mankind. What they will do I know not; but their case is deplorable - they come to meeting as usual - I am glad, my dear friend, that thou canst from a fresh feeling acknowledge the hedge of preservation continued about thee & thine - I am convinced there is nothing like it - Except the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it: except the Lord keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain. I believe the especial notice of Divine Providence is towards your house; but the continuance of this merciful Regard is to be humbly & diligently sought after, by reverent walking, by faithful obedience, & by a life not colleagued with, but opposite to the spirit of the world - I was 16th instant at Newtown-meeting - Jonas Duckett was there & appeared as a *Minister: otherwise, it was a silent Meeting - Is John Conran yet received as a Minister? - I am sorry by all accounts to hear that thy brother James is so poorly in his health. I hope he takes proper care of himself, gets good advice & puts it in practice - Neither the world, nor the church can spare him yet. We are obliged by thy invitation to our Molly - I hope she will at some time have the pleasure of seeing you there - Accept, my dear Cousin, of all our dear love - Present us to thy worthy Father, to all thy children, to thy brother James & his wife, to Cousin Richard Pike & his wife, & to dear Molly Phelps, & Abby Wright.
I am my dear Debbys
very affectionate friend & kisman
Richard Shackleton.
