we went into the saloon and
some played bagatelle, I for
one just [deletion]p[/deletion]took any turn and
and got 32 - then a game
was set on foot by Lizzie Coventry
at which we were just beginning
in earnest, when supper was
announced and we were all
paired into the supper room -
after which we went away -
What I was very dis-appoin[unclear]ted[/unclear]
to find Polly was not coming back
with us but was going to return
with Aunt Lydia so Philip & I had
to return just as we came with
the rain dripping on the top of the
car and poor Hyland [underline]shining[/underline]
with wet - the mare hardly
able to drag us home - I was not
in bed until after two, and consequently
this morning - Philips cold
is not I think any worse - Oh!
dear I wish the rain would stop
but there is no use in wishing
I asked Lizzie Coventry if she went
out to ride as she was talking
of doing & ride over here - but it is
not at all likely - - 10 O'clock PM
was not up very early
