Loveing Sister }
 Mary Barnard}
although I have been long silant it
hath not been the efects of forgetfullness for
thou hast been often in my rememborance but as
poor Daniel somtimes wrote to thee he suplyed the
that defect but dear sister we have nothing hear
that we can promise our selves any sirnainty in the
enjoyment of for allthough our dear son Daniel
was as promissin for life as any young man what [unclear]ead[/unclear]
and of late we have flattered our selves with hopes
of abundance of comfort in him; yet it pleased the
all wise disposer of allthings to take him from us in
his full strength which hath been great excersise
and sorrow to us all hear to whome he had of late
very much endeared himself by the good disposition
of mind that he hath been under for it pleased the
Lord to visit him with the incoms of his love & devine
goodness which had very much wrought uppon him
so that his disposition was very much reformed and
his conduct very sober and orderly & he had gained
the respect of all honest friends that wear acquaint
with him which makes the los of so hopefull a son
so much the greater to us yet as it was so we have
the more reason to hope that our loss is his eternall
gain oh that we may with a true & humble resignation
of mind submit to the devine will in all his
disposings & may with minds truely devoted to -
serve the Lord spend the remainder of our dayes so
as that the messenger of death may not surprise -
us at unawares but that we may be ready to meet
him without dismay or terror which that we may
be so prapared is my sinsear desire; he dyed the 10th
day of the 7th month of a fever which came by- a
Could in his ear and turned to are inflamation
uppon his Brain & as the Phistion judged came
to a mortyfication which took him of the 13th -
day of his illnes which he bore with a great deal
of patiance considering the accuteness of the pain

poor son John & his wife are yet with us but will
go to hous in abou 3 months time thay wear marryed
the begining of 3d month las since which Broer
Hillion is dead he dyed begining of 8th mo last he
had been indisposed about a year before he is :
very much lemented by friends in jenoral but
more apetialy to the friends of Westmoreland to
whome he was very servisable; the rest of our
famaly through mariye are in good health as
I desire theas may find thee with the rest of our
ralations at Ballytore my wife & Children
joyns me in dear Love to thee as allso to Cusin
Abram & his famaly allso pleas to remember
my dear Love to Cusin Deborah Fuller & her
Children with any other friends or relations as
