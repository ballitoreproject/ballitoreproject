My dear Mary
I recd thy letter with the books wch. have been distributed & pd
for excepting the four for Dublin, wch. I have forwarded there to my son Thos.
& expect he has, or will soon; receive balance of subscription - I send
by our Nancy 2-9.3 1/2 amt due thee - & wish all the other subscribers
may be equally punctual in rewarding thee for thy labour
many of the poems I admire much, & in my opinion thou needest
not be under any unfavourable apprehensions about the animadversions
of the reviewers - I have no doubt they will be favourable in the
agrigate & highly honourable to the author at least to the goodness of her
heart - and if the heart be right - it matters little what the opinions
of men may be respecting us - since reading the poems & Edmd Burkes
letters I have an higher opinion of him than I ever had before - notwithstanding
thy unbounded eulogy on his person & character &c. appear rather
too extravagant - but poets & enthusiasts often take liberties not warranted
to other folk - I added my own name to all the copies sent me
among the subscribers & woud have done so wth the other names [underline]omitted[/underline]
had I known them, tho' a matter of very little consequence - yet individuals
who wish'd to promote the consequence of their particular friends
will feel hurt at the exclusion - Thy Sister Sally wrote abt some
[unclear]wise[/unclear] work wch. I intended having made 'ere now but on enquiry for
the artist find he has been dead some time - affy. farewell saith thy
fnd
