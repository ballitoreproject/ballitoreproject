Ballitore 8th month 8th 1755
My dear Love,
This day I received thine of yesterday, which as it was vastly agreeable, so it has still more
strongly endeared thee to me, so that I am ready to say, as dear Saml Spavold, when we were present
with him at my table, "What manner of Love is this?" O, my dear, I can't help secretly rejoicing
that, though I acknowledge myself in every other respect unworthy of thee, yet I love thee with so sincere
& tender an affection, that I am almost encouraged to believe I deserve a share in thine. ++
Perhaps it may be as well, that I went last week, & not this. Tis' true, I might [underline]now[/underline] have some
company of my dear friends who are messengers of the gospel, but I could have but little of their
conversation in the [insertion]short[/insertion] stay I must be obliged to make there; & as for their ministry - I dare not
hunt much after it - lest I should be found, like Nimrod, hunting [underline]Before[/underline] the Lord -
hunting after the servant [underline]before[/underline], or rather than the Master: the voice rather than the word.

- - shewed me a letter from her mother, I dont much like [insertion]the temper of it[/insertion] as it respects her husband - but there
are few such wives as - who punctually & religiously observe the marriage contract of love & fidelity, which
no wrong disposition temper or humour in either, authorizes the other to violate
Well, certainly, let people either oppose it, or forget it as they may, & too many do, to
have the mind a little tinctured with religion is, for every reason, a most excellent & happy
thing. As people by frequent retirement, keep short reckonings, the way to make long friends, between
themselves & the witness which God has placed in them, & so by keeping the rubbish of
the cares of the world, the briars & thorns of their own perverse tempers, & the hard dry
clods of indifference & lukewarmness, from depressing, choking & bringing the seed of the
kingdom, give it room to grow & flourish - whether young or old they experience to their
own great quiet & satisfaction that this plant of renown gradually, by its own spreading
nature, overtops, & keeps under these lower weeds above-mentioned, & by the continual dropping
of its excellent virtue upon them, they very much die & wither away. And these
persons who thus come to have their natural tempers kept under, have the truest satisfaction
in the things of this life, as it is said, "Blessed are the Meek, for they shall
inherit the earth."

+ + It is my desire, my dear love, that in this interval between the present &
the time of accomplishing our intentions, we may labour in a particular manner to
have our minds fixed in their proper [deletion]order[/deletion] center, that so the little preparation of
several kinds, outwardly, which may be making towards it, may not too much
hurry & discompose us; but let us, in that respect, marry as though we married not, &
be found wrestling in spirit with the Almighty that he may be pleased to own
our joining; & cause the solemnity to be to his Glory. That is more my desire &
thine too, I am persuaded than after any satisfaction or profit, which we can enjoy
in one another without the feeling sense of his blessing upon it.
My spirit craves at this time that he may ever be near us, & delight in
us, that so in the seasons appointed by his infinite Wisdom, we may delight
in Him, & rejoice before Him. But methinks, my dearest, earthly [deletion][/deletion]
friend, these seasons are yet far [underline]from[/underline] [underline]me[/underline], & [underline]I[/underline] must be contented to go on in
the same track of nakedness, poverty & sorrow, in which I have travelled in [insertion]spirit[/insertion]
these seven last years of my life. Contented, did I say? Yea, I rejoice in
these stripping, proving & tribulated seasons, & my soul longs more & more to
be made a partaker of them. And is not this a marvellous thing, that a
man of my cast of temper should delight in sorrow? Marvellous are his
works indeed! as said the psalmist from his own experience, & as every
person, who tells of his marvellous acts, must declare from his own experience
also,

+ + + My two lodgers who had the measles are finely recovered through mercy, but
another is drooping to day, & we suspect that both Peggy & Aby are taking it. How I long
my very dear love, for the accomplishment of this affair! O may it please divine & Good
Providence, may I well call him, not to suffer my hopes to be thwarted in this respect, & to be with
us with his tendering power on the solemn occasion
