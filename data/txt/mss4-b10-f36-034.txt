23rd of 9th mo 1833
My dear Eliza
It is most likely before thou gets
this thou wilt be expecting to hear from us, the
days run over so fast and I have so little where
with to fill a sheet of paper that thou must
make allowance. In the first place we are
all well [underline]here, both houses[/underline]. Sarah is out with
us at present & the two younger children & [unclear]Mary[/unclear]
they are here since sixth day. I brought my
Aunt out on that morning also, there was a
youth's meeting held on 5th day, to which E&S went
in, Stephen Gillett spoke a long time to the
young people, the children, & to their parents, I
am sure thou would have liked to hear him.
I staid in town that I might bring my Aunt
out my Mother met us at the [unclear]Ruade[/unclear] they
are all well there and were asking for you
all from that we went to Dalkey, my
Aunt did not come in. we found Mrs Henry
very poorly in bed, and Olivia [deletion]also[/deletion] pretty
well but she does not appear to any body
Bessie & Mary, we saw they look badly and
seem very dull, which is not to be wondered

at. they gave us a most dismal account of
poor Olivia's trouble and how very badly she
was off in Cork for some one to be with her,
Capt Gaston was only eight hours ill, he came
home complaining at four oclock in the
evening and was dead at twelve, how
dreadful to be snatched so suddenly away,
they were [insertion]in[/insertion] very uncomfortable lodgings & the
people of the house were most unkind, the
[unclear]soldier[/unclear] that was attending him even fastened
Olivia out of his room when she happened
to go out for any thing, and she found
afterwards that it was drinking the brandy
that was for the patient, untill he was [unclear]drunk[/unclear]
how shocking and what a situation she
must have been in, I almost wonder
she kept her senses she is now quite composed
and [insertion]talks[/insertion] of him it appears as if he was
in bad spirits and that a weight was hanging
over him, one evening as Olivia & he
were standing at the window which looks
out on a grave-yard he told her it was there
he was to be buried and pointed out two
trees and said it was to be between them,
how very dismal, he was buried there very
soon after. I dont think I ever heard of

any thing more dismal, Mary told me she
had written to thee it is most likely she gave
thee a better account than I could, they are
greatly to be pitied. every one has their trials
no one seems to be exempt, if perchance there
are any who remain a long time free from
them, they then seem to come four-fold.
was it not so with us? is it not so with many?
I told thee before that Sarah &c came out
on Sixth day. Eliza & Rebecca Pim called
here that day also, they were telling us of Mary
and why she left them. she could not agree with
any of the servants and staid out without leave
they also say that she took a sup too
much, what a pity that she should
do the like. seventh was wet. first
day we went to meeting & met Mary G &
R Shackleton whom I asked to come dine
with [insertion]us[/insertion], & he at once said he would after he had
paid a visit at Dalkey. we also had John
& Martha & Susan. brother F also honoured
us. Edward & the children drove out but
staid only a short time I believe now
thou hast all the news that I know of
It is quite true of Rebecca Pim my Mother
asked her & she did not deny it but [underline]her[/underline]
mother said it was not to be for a while

poor Shemus looks very dismal and walks by himself
from meeting, as [underline]he[/underline] is the only person thou art interested
about. I need mention none of the others. and now
to speak to thee about scolding me in thy last
letter, thou hast not the least right to do so for
it was by no means carelessness that made me
send thee what I did, thou did not tell me [unclear]where[/unclear]
to send, but said to look in both places and
so I did, and sent the old thinking thou would
rather not have the new ones there but keep
them till thou came home so do not set it
all down to my carelessness, for I did it for the
best. & I am sure I did not know [underline]Pat[/underline] ever
 wore drawers I thought it was a [underline]petticoat[/underline] he wore
I have the bed ready for the hyacinths & intend

if tomorrow be fine to get them put down. We took
a jaunt to day to Bray the Savages have not yet left
that. Thou asked about Patty in thy last I concluded
that my Mother told that she left this the day after
we returned and has been very busy ever since preparing
for Tom we called there this day week I believe
it was & she was very busy she expects Jane home
in a fortnight. I hope thou wilt write soon. I am
very sorry not to hear a better account of Emy
poor little thing I wish she could sleep, & so Regy has
got a tooth. I hope Lucy's spirits are better than they
were. Is the [unclear]lard[/unclear] going in faster. give my dear
love to Frank & Lucy and a share for thyself
from thy affecte
Sister Selina
This letter will be so old before thou get it I suppose it will
be less welcome on that account, as it is not yet sealed I
may as well tell thee what we did today. in the first
place it has been a particularly windy showery day. I
put down all the hyacinth roots &c this morning, Sarah
& I dined with Elizth & my Mother had visitors while

we were out and was very busy. they had not long done
dinner when Jos & Sally Jacob & children came out, she
got early tea for them I believe about five and they were
all at it when Thomas Henry came so she had him
to entertain also. The Jacobs did not stay long we
only caught a glimpse of them as they passed the
gate. TH has been very poorly with the toothe ache
but is better or I suppose he would hardly have ventured
out to night. did thou hear that he has given
up the business of attorney. I believe he paid
my Mother a [underline]pretty considerably long[/underline] visit. she
had all the visitors to herself. My Aunt G came
 to tea to the cottage, Richard did not come home
till late he was in town since yesterday. I
suppose Sally M will be going to you on fifth day
there is not much use in my mentioning that
as I suppose thou wilt see her before thou gets
this as she is to take it. This is third day night that

I have written this postscript farewell again
We have got the Memoirs of Sylvia Pellico's imprisonments
& it is an interesting book.
