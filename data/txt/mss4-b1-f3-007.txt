	“Dear Father,
		The meeting began this day for the nation. I have not much to say about it. It looks as if we must labour hard for our bread, through the course of the meetings: perhaps it may be best so, for what is hardly gotten is oftentimes carefully kept. And, indeed, I think I have seen great loss accrue to some of honourable rank, in this respect; that when good Providence, in unmerited condescension has favoured them with the bedenings [?] of his goodness, in order for leavening and seasoning their spirits for his service, (which is so much wanting,) they have, for want of knowing a settlement and abiding in the life, let there [sic] favours pass transiently over, and not be productive of the fruit intended by them. And with sorrow it may be too often said of them: ‘Their goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it goeth away.’
					Thy affectionate son,
							R.S.
