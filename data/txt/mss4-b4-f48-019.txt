Ballitore: 23/12 mo: 1825
I was glad to get my dear Betsy's letter this morning. We now open
the Carlow bag first. It is well to endeavour to possess our souls in patience -
but I am tossed often in my mind, perhaps good news from you
might help to settle it - but the thought of [underline]Self[/underline] seems quite uppermost
My health seems a mighty object with me, watching myself, & studying
what will do me good - then my spirits flag, & I am weak within & weak
without - yet I believe I am better - & often think little or nothing is the matter
with my health. As to my poor, long-neglected mind - that is an object
for mercy. Dear Abigail Knott, the companion of my early youth, who made
a wise choice & an early sacrifice spoke a few words in our meeting this day
"In the morning sow thy seed, & in the evening withhold not thine hand' I forget
the rest of the text, her Sarah had first spoken on the text "the kingdom of
Heaven is taken by violence" which implied the conflict to be maintained
in order to arrive at a state of happiness. Sister Sally & Jacob Greene also. Jacob
spoke & the boys were tenderly addressed: Jacob & his amiable companion
John Richardson visited poor Becky Widdows, Jacob in testimony John
prayed. Becky appears to be declining - thy acceptable message of love she
shall have to-morrow I intend. Mary Doyle & Abby are pleased with their
share
Carlow 26th - What an acceptable Christmas-box was thy letter which we
received yesterday morning before WL & I left home for this place! Poor
dear Lydia! Need I send thee an ample portion of all our love [insertion]for her, thyself & all[/insertion] to which

Bess Birkett (alias Conway) requested hers to be added. It would be a
superfluous message to say, "Be careful & trust not too much to present favourable
appearances," because Lydia is surrounded by excellent nurses, [unclear]forbye[/unclear]
the best in Europe. I often think what great cause for thankfulness we have, but
the sensibility of this favor is wanting I my heart however. Well, you called
my grand-daughter what you liked, & I am in duty bound to thank you for the
compliment. I hope Mary will be as good as her brother, "What can I say more?"
This was pleasant Qrly meeting news, & seemed to give universal satisfaction.
The meeting has now ended. This last sitting was remarkable by dear John Richardson's
appearance in prayer, soon after we assembled. Rebecca Ridgway frequently
spoke, & Jacob Greene. Of the leper prophets, our own Betty Barrington, Betsy Beale &
Sarah Knott; the latter prayed a long time yesterday morning. Katherine Few also
spoke, & some in women's meeting, that I did not know. Thy Aunt SS's voice was also
heard, & early dedication called for.
We are at Lucy Allment's where S.S. WL & I are most kindly entertained - but we
have not the opportunity of seeing so many friends as at Jos.a Haughton's. We
breakfasted with him this morning. He has agreeable accounts from Ellen who
is much pleased with her situation, had received a visit from Thos. Wilkinson, who
came with a friend to look at a school there - they left her at 11 at night, & had 11
miles to go - [underline]but the country is honest.[/underline] Who knows but our country may grow
honest too, if Jos. Pike's & Jos. Cropper's plans take effect! James Pike - think
of the private act of honour & charity which I was witness to. I suppose I should
not know him if I saw him, but I always esteemed him since that transaction. We
had a pleasant visit last 7th day evening from little Jos.a Harvey, accompanied by
our sweet Wm. Harvey. Jos regretted so often missing thee, whose company he
seems to prize highly - he is very agreeable & convertible. Saml. Tolerton is
now here, listening to Lucy's & Mary's account of a young girl who was for

years robbing the shop - Lucy thinks to the amount of £150. Perhaps the account
of the flood which was so destructive here may have reached you. The
bridge is frightful one battlement torn away & a frightful gap in the bridge
Hannah Wilson's & other garden walls levelled - the water rushed through her hall
door & parlour windows. It got into the kitchens of both Saml Haughtons
but Lennon the Inn keeper seems to have been chief sufferer - the flood coming
in the night, drowned his pigs & poultry, swept away potatoes &c & a table whose
drawing containing cash & bills opened & swam away. His loss is computed to £200.
& he could accommodate no company but James Forbes. I saw dear old Samuel & [unclear]strong[/unclear]
Mary & sally with her lovely children, also thy letter to her, & heard of G Connor's welfare.
John Chandlee is here. 68 of us were entertained at Mary Lecky's last evening, where Hannah
Shackleton & I contrived to break a wine-glass, & where Mary Strangman told me she saw
"My Neighbour" printed in a little Almanack, called, I think, "the telescope," with my
After tea Jacob Greene, John Richardson & Saml. Bewley each of them spoke
very sweetly. Both our Richards were there. Geo: is on a Committee for a visit
to mo: meetings - I am glad of it. I saw Betsy Lecky yesterday followed by her daughter
in-law & daughter - the rear brought up by Eliz & Anna Watson dressed in mantles of a
dark colour & peculiar shape with a row of buttons behind (I believe not like Paddy's
from Cork) I had a good view of the bride, whose velvet hat both round & square apparently
& placed a little one one side was surmounted by a veil - her gown was red
silk - her face delicate & smooth, farther sayeth not - I regretted not having asked her
mother to introduce me to her, & told her so to day - she said she wished to do so, but could
not get us near enough. I did not see dear John, but George says he is just the same
& that they paid an agreeable visit. I am glad they paid it, & shewed that simplicity
&c is not incompatible with politeness. John wrote me a kind note, & sent me
Cropper's paper. Betsy & Lydia Lecky were much pleased to hear of Lydia. I believe they
thought of dear Hannah while they spoke to me, I thought I read it in their looks. Thy
dear Mother was at meeting on 6th day, & we have good accounts from her, as
I suppose so hast thou. WL just come in, sends dear love. MA Higginson
settled in Carlow. Harriet in the house with her, & no better, but cheerful

which is an ease to their minds. Julia& Will lodge here. To day [unclear]late[/unclear] next
thy aunt Sally & helped her with her dinner - that Sarah Watson who incurred
the censure of friends - her daughter Ellen who exposed her was here too, & lodged
here - & neither seemed [underline]a bit ashamed.[/underline] Supper is coming. Farewell ever loving
thee Lydia, Sally & all.
Dear love to Somerville house. Wm grows tall & very handsome
I always admired the lending system, & am glad it continues to succeed. Jane
Williams said a great deal about her visit to Richmond. She has been very ill since her
return with a cold which attacked several. Henry Williams has returned to Ballitore
to be agent instead of [unclear]Bourke[/unclear]. Eliza Mulronney is kind to her Mistress. Johnny reformed &
doing business - Success to your [unclear]quill[/unclear]. Mattw. Waring & his sister quite executive at Mary
Lecky's. Rebecca Grubb, a fine woman. D Stephenson, a good woman. Sarah Clibborn a pattern of
artlessness & humility were at this meeting, & many choice persons, old & young. Thy Aunt Sallys
eyes are poorly - she has the greatest messages of love to thee & Lydia, & thinks of dictating a letter
to thee while here - she is pleased to hear of Mary's nails
