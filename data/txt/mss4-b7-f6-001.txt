Greenbank 26th Feby 1823
My dear friend
I am sorry that I could not, with
Satisfaction, sooner acknowledge the [unclear]need[/unclear] of thy
interesting letter, dated the 10th of this month, but it
was forwarded to me at Manchester, where, with
my Cousin Richd Ball, I was on a visit to my Neice
Abigail Dockney, and on our return my Cousin engaged
my whole time, since he left us, I have looked
over all my dear Fathers papers, and letters, being very
unwilling to think the very few sent here with
were all, that he had recd from thine, but my
search has been so diligent, that I can no longer
hope to find more; - many packets of letters were
found directed for, and which were duly sent to, the
several writers, - my Sons cannot recollect forwardg
any to your family, - but I will write to my Bro:
and ask if he does, - in the mean time I am
anxious to send the small, but valuable portion
of treasure, which I hope though will receive safely
and that thou will believe in my willingness, and
desire, to forward thy views, if it were in my power,
or in any way to manifest the esteem and regard

which I have long felt for thee, and thy
family, tho personally known to so few
of them, to my dear, kind friend, thy Sister
Sarah, I beg to be affectionately remembered,
I often think of her, tho it is now so long
since we met; - also to Ebenezar and his
Deborah, of whose better health, I should be
thankful to hear; - I am almost ashamed to
say that I remember S Hanghton with [unclear]sineene[/unclear]
affection, because I have [underline]appeared[/underline] so inattentive
to her, - but I was always so poor a letter writer,
that now, old age furnishes an apology for not
attempting, to write, tho my heart often dictates
the language of affection, sympathy, and
gratitude to, and for, my absent friends. -
My Sister Benson has generally enjoyed good
health, at least better of late years, than when
she was much younger, but has lately experienced
some interuption to it, she is however again
better, and will I trust be spaned to her family
with comfort to herself; - her son Robt- who is
just now confined by the gout - has three children,
her daughter Abigail seven, all, with her daughter

Maryl, in good health, I know they wd like to send
their love, tho I have not had an oppy of necg
this message from them. - I have seven
grand children who with Parents, and my
three unmarried children, are pretty well, but
none of them present; - we often hear
from our friend T Houlbrooke, whose good wife
makes him very happy, he has also very comfortable
health, tho he speaks of being affected by some
of the infirmities of age. - I presume thou knows
that Edward Rushton has been dead some years
his son resembles him in many respects, he
has the same integrity - good sense, intrepidity,
and eloquence, - I do not known that he is a
poet. - - I cannot doubt your possessing
many copies of "Verses addressed to John Gough."
"On coming to C: Dale in the night time." -
"On Pleasure to M S." - "On the birth of his
Grandson." Lines written in the year 1753 -
"What thanks to thee, oh gracious Power we owe, "
which are all I find, with thy dear Fathers name,
there is also a copy of a letter addressed to the
Mens and Womens meetings at Bristol - 1780 - signed
by him, Thomas Gneer, and Robt Dudley; - and two
extracts from letters, in a book of manuscripts,
without name, or date, which I believe to be thy

Fathers writing. - If thou canst make me
of use to thee, in any way, I hope thou will do so
freely, and believe me with best wishes for all who
are dear to thee, thy affectionate friend
