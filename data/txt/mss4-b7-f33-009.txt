My Dear Friend
Wm & M Leadbeater
I yesterday heard of a most affecting
and melancholy accident that has fallen to
your lot that must draw every feeling mind
into a near sympathy with you I am [insertion]sure[/insertion] it did one
if report speaks truth you have lost your oldest
Child by being burnt in a most sorrowful way
the Dear little innocent creature is early but not
untimely gone I trust tho it may be said came to
rather an untimely end, but the ways of Providence
are unsearchable and past finding out by us poor
shortsited creatures I hope your grief will be
moderated under this consideration that she is gone
from an abundance of trouble, for what she is

there to be met with here you have known it you
have often felt it, and how have you been carried
thro & by whom, by the power of matchless love
that I believe if you seek after it, will help over
this also - and sweeten this bitter cup and make
it more easy than you cou'd expect, and you know
it is better she shou'd be taken now in a state of
innocence than live to a more advanced age and
do that - that might be a thorn in your sides
think of my Dr Companion & then who can lament
the loss of an innocent child Yet I feel with you
and for you in near & dear Sympathy & if it was
not so I wou'd not put pen to paper at this time
Since I beheld your faces you have been closely tried
many ways & none of us knows what is yet to come
both within & without nor how much is sufficient

for us to make us what we ought to be & what the Lord wou'd have
us be, we all know this that the Lord's judgements are in the Earth
but how few thereby have learned Righteousness this my Dear
friends I dont hint to you far be it from me, for thro all the wars
and fluctuations of the times we as a people have been marvously
car'd for, & you have in a wonderful manner escap'd the hands
of wicked & bloodthirsty men & I trust he will not leave nor forsake
in this day of deep trial -- in near & dear love & sympathy I salute
and bid you farewell may we all farewell in the Lord is the ardent
desire of your poor friend
my love to all my friends there
