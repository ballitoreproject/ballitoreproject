My dear E
It was very well my
father came to take home
all my notes as I had not
time to send any by R S
I was glad to hear that the
account from E Gough was
agreeable no one here had
heard lately from her at least
that I know of - did I tell
thee that the 25 caps came
quite safe to Richd an ample
supply! my father brought the
little frock - D Johnson is
recruiting she has been in
the country a second [unclear][/unclear]

time I have not seen her
lately as I was confined to
the house for a week with
a cold - When convenient
please send the butter but
dont hurry thyself, how
is Hannah S? it is a very
long time since I heard
from Lyddy I mean to
write to her soon, she
is happy to have Betsy
with her, she is well off
to have so many kind friends
about, if they were to be had
at all she would attract
them to her, she is so gay
& pleasant
Margt does not forget Ballitore
I often hear her repeating the little
songs you used to sing for her
there - to day I was puzzled to
understand her, saying she had
a little dog at home, at last
she mention'd the little petticoat
all round about -
farewell thy SB
write soon & tell me some
news, Susy Jessop is dead
