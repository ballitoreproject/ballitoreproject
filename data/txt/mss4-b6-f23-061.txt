There you might see them all
[deletion]walking around the [unclear][/unclear][/deletion]
sitting in rows, one seen
over another while the mistress
was pointing to a picture
the first happened to be a
zebra - "What [deletion]pr[/deletion] animal is
that" says she - he [unclear][/unclear]
answered with one voice "It
is an ass" - one said
No It is a zebra with pretty
stripes" - They were then asked
which they liked - an ass or zebra
"A zebra! a zebra! "Why"
"Because it is pretty" [deletion]are[/deletion]
"But the ass is more useful"
A little moralizing then went
on between mistress & children
the mistress seldom gave
her opinion, but asked them
1
Infant school
Son - As I often
have good sale
for my wares at
schools, I stopped in
Dublin at a house
where I saw "North
east Infant school" painted
on a board over the door
The mistress [deletion]came[/deletion] bought a
few pictures from me
which delighted the children
very much - Seeing them
so young, I made bold to
[deletion]ask[/deletion] enquire what they
could learn -
Father - Why, how old

2
were they?
Son - the oldest
was only 7, &
there was every age
between that & 2 years.
Father - oh! that
is all folly, a child
of 2 years old or 3 either
ought to stay with its
mother
Son - Well! I believe they
ought in a general way,
&, that it is better for the
mothers too, to be obliged to
take care of their children,
when very young, but I am
told that in large cities
both mothers & children
[underline]sometimes[/underline]
3
are often so situated that
an Infant school is of
great service to both -
The children are corrupted
by [deletion]the[/deletion] crowds of little companions
[deletion]before one[/deletion] incredibly
soon - A widowed mother
may have no other way
of gaining a living but by
hiring herself to work out of
her own house.
Father - There may be such
cases, & I hope before a child
is admitted all these enquiries
are made.
Son - Well father! I was going
to tell you that the mistress
was so civil as to ask
me to look at her school, &
indeed it was a pleasant sight
