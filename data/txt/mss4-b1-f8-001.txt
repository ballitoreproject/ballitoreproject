A brief account of some remarkable visions &c of John Adams
of Yorkshire, a little before and in the time of his Travels in Holland
and Germany. Supposed to be in ye. 2d. & 3d mo. 1712 he not being
positive in ascertaining the time thereof [insertion]exactly[/insertion] when he gave this Account
in Dublin, in Ireland.
I the said John Adam[deletion]s[/deletion], having drawings on my Spirit,
to go to Holland in Truth's service was under great reasonings
[unclear]of[/unclear] mind before. I could give up thereunto, considering my want
of Qualifications to go to a people of a strange Language, but in some
time received encouragement, by a vision or dream on the night-season, 
in substance as followeth, viz!
I was in Vision in a very pleasant, delightful plain, where
I was filled with Heavenly enjoyments, and in a little time beheld a
bright appearance approaching as a man, but exceeding glorious
beyond what I can express, and the nearer he drew to me, the more
my heart was filled with love to him, & also with holy admiration, reverence
and fear, but when he came nigh he spake unto me, and said,
Wilt thou go with me to preach the Gospel in Holland?, To which I
answered, "I think myself very unworthy, and unqualified, to undertake
so great a work, yet if it pleaseth thee to accompany me with
thy sweet and comfortable presence, as I now enjoy it, I dare not
deny thee," He said, "Thy request is granted: fail not to do it." Whereupon
awoke with this evidence, that it was the Lord Jesus Christ who
had so appeared unto me, and therefore I freely gave up, & made
ready for my Journey, and accordingly.
I went to Hull intending directly from thence to Amsterdam,
and found that several Ships were ready & putting out
to Sea, for that Port, but I was so seized with an Horror of darkness,
and as it were Death, [deletion]y[/deletion] [insertion]that[/insertion] I could not go aboard any of them, seeing   
no way to escape Destruction if I so went; but there being
some other Ships bound for London, I was more easy to go in one
of them than in any of those to Holland, tho' y! also seemed [insertion]very[/insertion] dim
and afflicting; yet there appeared a little Glimmering of light, and
came to pass, ye. first night we were at sea, after a time of calm
there arose a [insertion]sudden[/insertion] storm, wch. increased so yt. the waves beat into & over
the ship, besides wch. about midnight another distressed Ship came

came foul upon us, and fastened to our's, so that both were like to sink and
perish together, and four Men from that Ship were cast thence by
[deletion][/deletion] the Waves into our Ship and so saved; but after sometime the
said Ship loos[insertion]e[/insertion]ned or broke it's hold from our's, and about passing
athwart our Stern sunk down, and all therein perished, the [unclear]shrieks[/unclear]
of the People were very dismal, and piercing to us, but through [unclear][/unclear]
Good Providence of God we got safe to London, where I met
Companion Joseph Richardson, and from thence had a good passage
together to Holland. It is also to be noted as very remarkable
[insertion]& signal[/insertion] that the aforesaid Ships which had set out from Hull [insertion]directly[/insertion] for Holland,
in one whereof I purposed to have gone, had not Providence
marvellously prevented, were all lost the same night, being nineteen
in number, and the people perished.
We landed at Helvoetsluys and travelled through Holland
to Fredrick-stadt in Germany, where that night I had a Vision as followeth,
vizt.
I thought I was standing alone in a large Plain, wherein [unclear][/unclear]
other living Creature, for a time, appeared; after which I saw [unclear][/unclear]
Appearance at a great distance, which advanced gradually towards
me, and as it came nigh [deletion]nigh[/deletion] a Sense livingly arose
 my heart, that it was the Devil, and also a [insertion] caution or [/insertion] warning to prepare
[unclear][/unclear] so he came up and stood as I supposed within ten yards distance
me, in figure of a mighty Giant, of greater stature than any [unclear][/unclear]
I have read [insertion]of[/insertion]; his raiment (if any) [insertion]& Colour[/insertion] was black, and shining; his [unclear][/unclear]
dreadful, and on his head as it were a Crown of moving fire, his
Aspect grim and frightful; but I was not at all afraid of him; [unclear][/unclear]
after a while he spoke to this effect, "So, John, thou hast got here." Yes
I, "I have [insertion]got here[/insertion]." "More shame and contempt, said he, that thou art [unclear][/unclear] hither."
"Why so"? said I. He said, "Because thou art led by a [insertion]w[/insertion]rong spirit,
and fled from thy Reputation; thy business and concerns
"which thou has left behind are made wreck of, and it's [unclear][/unclear]
"a great reproach to the country thereabout; the religious People [unclear][/unclear]
"filled with mourning and sorrow of heart, and the more loose sort
"their Heads and hiss, saying, "This is he who pretends to Inspiration
"now we see the bottom of him, that he is a deceiver." I answered, [insertion]that[/insertion] "I [unclear]cannot[/unclear]
"not "believe him, nor his Doctrine, for I was apprized who he was,
"besides I left all things at home to my own and my friends' Satisfaction
"committing them all to that hand that always provided for me

and is with me still, therefore I would have thee to desist; for I believe
thee not." "Oh, said he, thou art hard! but I will convince thee before we
have done, for thou readest," Out of the mouth of two or three witnesses everything[deletion]s[/deletion]
shall be established." "I grant it, said I, with a Proviso,
that those two or three witnesses be credible; but if thou brings two or
three hundred, there are none of them worth believing." Then, said he,
the main reason [insertion]why[/insertion] things are so, is, thy Wife is dead, that used to be at
the Helm in thy absence; and this is not the first time that thou hast been
deceived in such like undertakings; but the Lord being long suffering
brought not his judgments upon thee until now." So he being silent a while,
I saw at a distance something sliding along on the ground, and when it came
nigh, it appeared to be a Coffin, and settled between him and me, with the
head towards me, the Lid whereof opened or slided back of it's own accord,
so that I saw an appearance as if it was really and perfectly my Wife's
Corpse; but a caution arose in my heart, thus, "Touch not the dead, nor believe
the living." Then, said I to the Enemy, "this is but like the second part
to the same Tune; Pry'thee who was the Master of all the Magicians in
Egypt? was it not thyself? And I suppose thou art no less cunning now,
therefore I believe no more [insertion]now[/insertion] than I did before. How came it to pass that
you could make appearances of great things fals[insertion]e[/insertion]ly, which the Almighty
was pleased to do really, for the Confirmation of his people and
confounding their enemies; but could not all make a Louse"? To which he
being silent, I told him "though they were permitted to do great things, yet
[unclear][/unclear] pleased the Almighty to shew that he could confound them in so small
a thing"; to which he made no Answer.
After sometime of silence; I saw afar off an Appearance like a Man,
which drawing nearer towards me, was so exact a Resemblance of a
Neighbour of mine who had formerly dwelt with me some years as a
Servant, and behaved faithfully [deletion][/deletion] [insertion]that[/insertion] forgetting or disregarding the caution
given me not to believe the living; I said in my Heart, "there comes
my Neighbour Thomas, who, being come directly from Home (I believe
he will tell me truly." And when nigh, I said, "So, Thomas, how dost thou
And how does my wife, and Friends and Relations, and Concerns
at Home? He answered with much seeming Gravity, and solemnly confirmed
what the Enemy had said before, with great Illustrations, desiring
me for the Lord's sake, and for my own soul's sake, and reputation, to return
home, and said he had faith to believe that if I returned speedily,
I might, with his Assistance, which he would give me, with
other

others, retrieve and bring things to a degree of reputable order before I [unclear][/unclear]
but he said, "If thou dost not comply with my Advice, and believe the
"foregoing testimonies, there's nothing for thee but Hell and damnation."
Whereupon I awoke under a sense of horror, afflicting my Companion
and prepared myself to hasten homeward: But in the interval a
Messenger came to the door with a letter for my Companion Joseph
Richardson, which I staid to hear read, the conclusion whereof
gave an Account of the welfare of my Wife and family, Friends
affairs at home, whereby I was relieved in my mind, and confirmed that
I was in my place, and that it was Satan, by transformation
who had so deceived and distressed me; and then I resigned to stay
and to do what Service the Lord had for me in those parts.
