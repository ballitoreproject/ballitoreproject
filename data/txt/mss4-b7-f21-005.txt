Whatever comes from you, my dear Friend, comes so kindly
from the Heart, that with me it has always a sweet savour.
Thanks for the Ointment & Recipe - also for your papers - I have
been much pleased with your continuation of your Village History -
for it has made me intimately acquainted with your associates
as well as with yourself, & the more I know of you, the better I am
pleased - Great A's Ltrs rather raise him in my estimation,

Yrs very affectly [unclear]JW[/unclear]
I keep the Ltrs till the Capt. returns.
