Tell Eben that the wine is ready for the [unclear]cower[/unclear],

My dear S
I do not think after, or provided, I tell you
how the children are, that I can devote this sheet of
paper to a better purpose than by transcribing the
following extracts, which are easily reduced to practice
and which having read with attention myself I submit
to your [underline]careful perusal[/underline]. "As most of the unhappiness
of the world arises rather from disappointed desires, than from
positive evil, it is of the utmost consequence to attain just notions
of the laws and order of the universe, that we may not vex
ourselves with fruitless wishes, or give way to groundless and
unreasonable discontent. The laws of natural philosophy, indeed,
are tolerably understood and attended to; and tho' we may
suffer inconveniences, we are seldom disappointed in consequence
of them. No man expects to preserve orange trees in the open air
through an English Winter; or when he has planted [insertion]an acorn[/insertion], to see it
become a large oak in a few months. The mind of man
naturally yields to necessity; and our wishes soon subside
when we see the impossibility of their being gratified. Now,
upon an accurate inspection, we shall find, in the moral
government of the world, and the order of the intellectual system,
laws as determinate, fixed, and invariable as any in Newton's Principia.
The progress of vegetation is not more certain than the
growth of habit; nor is the power of attraction more clearly proved
than the force of affection or the influence of example. The man
therefore who has well studied the operations of nature in mind
as well as matter, will acquire a certain moderation and equity
in his claims upon Providence. He will never be disappointed
either in himself or others. He will act with precision, and expect
that effect, and that alone, from his efforts, which they are naturally
adapted to produce. For want of this, men of merit & integrity
often censure the disposition of Providence for suffering characters
they despise to run away with advantages which, they yet
know, are purchased by such means as a high & noble spirit
could never submit to. If you refuse to pay the price, why
expect the purchase? We should consider this world as
a great mast of commerce, where fortune exposes to our
view various commodities, riches, ease, tranquillity, fame
integrity, knowledge. Every thing is marked at a settled

price. Our time, our labour, our ingenuity, is so much ready money
which we are to lay out to the best advantage. Examine, compare,
choose, reject; but stand to your judgement; and do not, like children,
when you have purchased one thing, repine that you do not
possess another which you did not purchase. Such is the force
of well regulated industry, that [underline]a steady & vigorous exertion of[/underline]
[underline]our faculties, directed to one end, will generally ensure success[/underline]
Would you, for instance, be rich? Do you think that single point
worth sacrificing every thing else to? You may then be rich.
Thousands have become so from the lowest beginnings by toil,
and patient diligence, and attention to the minutest articles of expence
and profit. But you must give up the pleasures of leizure,
of a vacant mind, of a free unsuspicious temper. If you preserve
leave your integrity, it must be a coarse [unclear]opion[/unclear] & vulgar [unclear]honer[/unclear]
Those high and lofty notions of morals which you brought with you
from the schools, must be considerably lowered, and mixed with
the baser alloy of a jealous and worldly minded prudence. You
must learn to do hard of not unjust things; and for the nice
embarrasments of a delicate and ingenuous spirit, it is necessary
for you to get rid of them as fast you possible. You must shut
your heart against the muses, and be content to feed your understanding
with plain household truths. In short you must not
attempt to enlarge your ideas, or polish your taste, or refine your
sentiments; but must keep on in one beated track, without turning
aside either to the right hand or the left. "But I cannot submit
to drudgery like this - I feel a spirit above it." Tis well: Be
above it then; only do [underline]not repine that you are[/underline] not rich. 20th Mar
My dearest S. I had written thus far, during my breakfast hour this
morning and since I have rec'd your letter of yesterday. If I had known
that I could have saved you the feelings you express, most assuredly
I should have written [insertion]on the 18th[/insertion]. Now to make amends, you have my most
hearty concurrence in delaying your return, if it will be beneficial to
your health, your acct of which troubles me much. I am puzzled
about it. The debility you mention should be overcome without any
delay whatever; and of the means which nature points out be not
sufficient, I entreat you to obtain some medical advice. My
prescription would be principally [insertion]composed of[/insertion] a contented mind, fresh air, [underline]regular[/underline]
[insertion]daily[/insertion] exercise, if walking fatigues too much, a carriage of some kind should be had and
I am sure this would be afforded most willingly by our kind friend, and
last & perhaps not [insertion]least[/insertion] [underline]nourishing[/underline] food. If you wish, therefore, my dear S -,
stay as long as [underline]your health[/underline] improves, the [unclear]re'attachment[/unclear]  of it with me
supersedes every other desire that I can have. When you think my
presence will contribute to it, write me word and you shall
have it. Before I rec'd your letter to day, I thought that if you
staid till next week, I should go down, whether you sent for me
or not. Do as you please now. I slept at the Glen on Friday,

night and found the children better than ever I saw them in health. Richd
came from that this morning and can hear the like testimony. Johnny says
very well for him "Dog & Cat". Margt can use her limbs in a much
more masterly style. She walked uptowards the haygard gate the other
day looking for my Mother. When she went out [unclear]first[/unclear] she would [unclear]sear[/unclear]
attempt up or down hill. When she was undressing the other night, some
one said. " Margt has a nice little calf to her leg" after a bit, she spoke,
"and have I a calf to my leg, aunt Lucy have [underline]you[/underline] a Cow to
[underline]your[/underline] leg". I did apologize to my Mother for leaving them so
long with her, but I believe she takes a pleasure in having
them [deletion][/deletion], even besides that of obliging us." You will
be glad to hear that trading concerns are not getting worse,
consequently some would say they are mending, and if I cannot
subscribe to them, I may tell you, that on looking more narrowly
into our Profit & Loss acct this year, it promises much better than
we were led to suppose. So we plod along with great vigour.
I should have told you that one reason I did not write on
Saturday was want of time to do it as I wished. I wrote
a long letter to you yesterday however, but you will [unclear][/unclear]
may I hope, see it for many a day, being one t[unclear][/unclear]
I alluded some time since when I shewed you another [unclear]document[/unclear]
Which I was also employed in correcting yesterday. My [unclear]thoughts[/unclear]
were with you all day almost. If you were in good health
I do not know at this present time that I could
fairly complain of any one portion of my lot, so now
make up the deficiency as fast as you can and let me hear [underline]soon[/underline]
how you are; whilst I remain yours as ever EB. PS I prize
much the few lines from your mother, thank her for them
with my dear love. She said I was kind & good, but alas!
it was her good nature, not those qualities in me, made
her say so. I mean to be kind, but am not so too often.
I endeavour to do good, but deserve not the appellation. EB
Shall I go on with the extracts. "Is knowledge the pearl of
price? That too may be purchased - by steady application,
and long solitary hours of study & reflection. Bestow these, and
you shall be wise." But (says the man of letters) what a hardship
it is that many an illiterate fellow who cannot construe the motto
of the arms on his coach, shall raise a fortune and make a figure,
while I have little more than the conveniences of life! Et tibe
magna satest - Was it in order to raise a fortune that you consumed
the sprightly hours of youth in study and retirement? Was it to be rich that
you grew pale over the midnight lamp, and distilled the sweetness
from the Greek and Roman spring? You have mistaken your path
and ill employed your industry. "What reward then have [unclear][/unclear]

labours? What reward! A large, comprehensive soul, well purged from
vulgar fears and perturbations, and prejudices; able to comprehend [deletion]the[/deletion]
and interpret the works of man - of God. A rich, flourishing, cultivated
mind, pregnant with inexhaustible stories of entertainment and reflection.
A perpetual spring of fresh ideas; and the conscious dignity of superior
intelligence. Good Heaven! and what reward can you ask besides?
"But is it not some reproach upon the economy of Providence
that such a one, who is a mean dirty fellow, should have amassed
wealth enough to buy half a nation? Not in the least. He made
himself a mean dirty fellow for that very purpose. He has paid
his health, his conscience, his liberty for it; and will you envy him
his bargain? Will you hang your head and blush in his presence
because he outshines you in equipage and show? [underline]Lift up your [unclear]brow[/unclear] with a[/underline]
[underline]noble confidence[/underline], and say to yourself, I have not these things it is true;
but it is because I have not sought, because I have not desired them;
it is because I possess something better. I have chosen my lot. I am
content and satisfied. "You are a modest man - You love
quiet and independence, and have a delicacy and reserve in your
temper which renders it impossible for you to elbow your way in the
world, and be the herald of your own merits. Be content then with a
modest retirement, with the esteem of your intimate friends, with the
praises of a blameless heart, and a delicate ingenuous spirit; but
resign the splendid distinction of the world to those who can better
scramble for them. "The man whose tender sensibility of conscience
[unclear][/unclear] regard to the rules of morality makes him scrupulous
[unclear][/unclear] of offending, is often heard to complain of the disadvantages
he lies under in every path of honour and profit.
"Could I but get over these sure points, and conform
to the practice and opinions of those about me,
I might stand as fair a chance as others for [unclear]dignities[/unclear]
and preferment." As [unclear][/unclear] can you not? What
hinders you from [unclear][/unclear] this troublesome
