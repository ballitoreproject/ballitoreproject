Dear Cousin,
Tis now several years since the Correspondence
betwixt thee & me was dropt: but notwithstanding that,
I have often thought of thee particularly of late, I think few if
any days have gone over my head, but I have had the in Remembrance :
many & various are the Scenes I have passed thro'
since I wrote last to thee, & tho' I am still but young in years, I
have met with a good deal of Trouble on various accounts, part
I confess of my own bringing on, a Consideration tending rather to
[unclear]a[/unclear]ggravate than alleviate them. I have been near six years married
[unclear]to[/unclear] a [insertion]young[/insertion] man, a neighbour, with whom I had contracted an Acquaintance
when I was but a Girl, but knowing how disagreeable the match would
be to my Father, I durst not on any consideration consent to it in his
[unclear]Li[/unclear]fe time, but engaged my myself to marry him. if I shou'd survive my
Father; who was suddenly removed from us by Death, presently after the
[unclear]A[/unclear]ffair got out, & reached the Knowledge of [underline]Friends,[/underline] who took unwearied
Pains to prevent it, & laboured with me in much Love to desist & refrai[unclear]n[/unclear]
his Company, but all to no purpose; I can't express, nor believe I tho[unclear][/unclear]
[unclear][/unclear] Conflicts. I had [unclear][/unclear] known [unclear][/unclear]

twin; the last prevailed, & I fled from the faces of my best friends,
(I thought them so even then,) to rid myself of their kind & well meant
Importunities. I was greatly dissatisfied with the Step I took, even
at the very time I was taking it, I knew it was wrong: & after my marriage
was for three years (tho' I regretted my unhappy State & the
Cause of it,) in a kind of a gloomy lethargic Disposition of mind; but
afterwards growing more [insertion]& more[/insertion] uneasy under it, I became desirous to make
publick Confession of my Error & [insertion]beg[/insertion] to be reconciled to my Friends, for whom
I had all along entertained a loving Regard. I accordingly writ a
paper in much sincerity of Heart (& I hope some degree of [insertion]true[/insertion] Repentance)
to the monthly meeting, desiring & hoping it might have been
accepted without my Personal appearance; but [underline]Friends[/underline] thinking
[underline]that[/underline] necessary, two months after, the monthly meeting being held here,
I had notice of it given me, & that [underline]Friends[/underline] expected me there. I went
into the men's Meeting (I may truly [insertion]say[/insertion]) in much Awe, fear & trembling:
the paper being read, Questions agreeable & necessary to the Occasion
were asked me, to which I was too much aff[deletion]l[/deletion]ected to return any
[unclear][/unclear] but broken & almost unintelligible answers: Friends compas[unclear][/unclear]
[unclear][/unclear] Care, & [unclear][/unclear]& Charity granted my Petition:
since
since which Time I have been favoured with their tender regard
& notice; tho' I can't get to meetings as often as I cou'd
wish, my Husband has no aversion to Friends, yet he is not
willing I shou'd go when I am likely to be wanted at home, which
on week days especially, is frequently the case, as we keep a little
Shop, & my Husband often works at his own Trade.
And notwithstanding my Heart is in some respect more
at ease than before, yet I have still many difficulties to encounter
with: I have three Children living, my oldest a fine Girl, who was
taken from us before she cou'd go alone, & has continued with my
Husband's mother ever since, who is unwilling to part with the
Child; & the poor little Creature is already often distressed to
know how to behave betwixt us; she wou'd go to meetings with me,
& use the Jingle Language, but tells me she dare not for fear of
offending her Grandmother, whom the Child is very fond of. I
long to have her home, but my Husband will not allow me so much
as to hint my Desire to his mother; but I hope if I live yet to gain
that point. my little boy & Girl at home if don't live to see them
up, (or probably if I do), may fall into improper Hands, under the
Tuition of people, who, for want of having a proper Care over them,
may expose them to Temptations & Difficulties they might
have been exempt from, had mine been a more prudent Choice.

And now; dear Cousin, I have in some Degree informed thee
how things have been & are with me, [insertion]tho'[/insertion] I and pretty much a
Stranger to the Particulars of thy Situation -
I heard some time ago with concern that thou enjoyed
but poor health, & was under a great depression of Spirits, a
State I have been little tried with, tho' many who were never
so faulty as I have been, (many good& worthy People) have known
it. I believe 'tis a painful trying Time, & tho' Providence is all
Sufficient, yet the Company & Regard of good [underline]Friends[/underline] may be of
great Service, & a means of pouring the Balm of Comfort & Consolation
into an afflicted humbled Heart; 'tis far from my design to
give thee any offence, of take upon me to advise, knowing myself
a very improper Person to do it, & I hope I dont value myself upon
my own Reconciliation with [underline]Friends.[/underline] I'm sure every time I think of it,
Tho' it's a Comfort to me, it rather helps to humble than exalt me in
my own opinion: Shall be very glad of a Line or two from thee whent it's
convenient, & should be very pleased if thou wou'd write to me with the same F[insertion]r[/insertion]eedom
& Confidence I have used to thee, & shou'd be rejoiced to hear thou wert perfect[unclear]ly[/unclear]
reconciled [insertion]& re-united[/insertion] to thy Friends & Parents, & that thy worthy Father & mother
might yet live to have Comfort in thee, & thou in them: my good
Wishes attend thy Husband & Children, from
thy affectionate Kinswoman
Eliz. Dale.
