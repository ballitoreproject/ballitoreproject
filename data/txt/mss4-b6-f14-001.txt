Dublin, 4 January 1781.
Dear Molly
According to your desire I write these few lines
to you informing you that I arrived safe in town only that I got
a very violent cold when I was in the stage.
I have not yet gone to any business, but my mother intends
bringing me to Lord Naas very shortly, who, I expect will do every
thing in his power for me.
I am very happy to have to say, that my step-mother
[unclear][/unclear] me in everything I want as if she was my own mother
I strive on that account to obey her in every thing she requires of me
to do.
I beg you will tell old Mr. & Mrs. Shackleton that I am
exceedingly thankful to them for the good advice they gave me
which I hope will be of advantage to me [deletion]in f[/deletion] as long as I
live.
My Mother joins me in best respects to you & old
Mr. & Mrs. Shackleton, though not known to you.
I am, dear Mary
your loving friend
John Conway Hughes
P.S.
I beg you will excuse the writing,
as I wrote it by candle- light, have a
sore finger & besides thought I would not be
time for the post

Miss Mary Shackleton
