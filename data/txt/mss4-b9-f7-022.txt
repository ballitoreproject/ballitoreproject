My dear Elizabeth
Thanks for your letter of
the 31st Ult & 2nd Inst. untill I rec'd it I did
not know that McDonald had quit.
I hope he paid you. Do just what you
think best regarding Jas. Lynch as I
know nothing of him. Jim Murphy
may get the stones as I believe we
[insertion]should[/insertion] not [deletion]to[/deletion] be too kind as a man who
has so lately met his great loss. It will
he request to inform John Doyle of this
who might not to let him injure the
quarry. What is the cause of him
being so dilatory? has he been paid
Eben? I am pretty certain that
both Dr. Goattan and Miss Ardells received
your communications, it is not
surprising they have remained unanswered
by them. Let us know from
time to time how Debh gets on and
thank Aunt Grubb from me for her
kind messages and good wishes towards
us; I often regret that I am so little
acquainted with her and our cousins
her children to whom I have become
related by marriage I remain yours
affectionately
EB
