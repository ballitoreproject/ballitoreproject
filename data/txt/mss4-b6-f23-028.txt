Henry
Poor Idiot, on thy graceful form
Thy shining locks & polish'd brow
We gaze with pity & regret
Oh what an early wreck art thou!
The mind that once inspir'd that form
Beam'd brightly in his sparking eyes
While on his couch to seek repose
Heedless of ill, young Henry lies.
Soft slumbers steal oe'r every sense
Alas how quickly did they fly!
He wakes - he sees a [deletion]monstrous [/deletion] [insertion]hideous[/insertion] form
With horrid glare approaching nigh
In vain he seeks [insertion]his eyes [/insertion]to veil [deletion]his eyes [/deletion]
His couch unwonted movements heave
now terror has the triumph gain'd
Malignant powers, your victim leave
Oh there are no malignant powers,
Young Henry's blithe associates they,
With thoughtless & unfeeling hearts,
Who rashly plann'd this cruel play
The morning comes [deletion][/deletion] oe'r natures [insertion]face [/insertion]
She spreads her cheerful rosy light
The morning comes but Henry's soul
Is wrapped in shades of deepest night
The vacant look, the [insertion]idiot [unclear]causeless[/unclear][/insertion] laugh
Proclaim the cureless mischief done,
The opening buds of [deletion]youth are[/deletion] [insertion]promise[/insertion] crush'd
And Reason banish'd from her throne.
Yet memory, breaking thru the cloud
Will oft the dreadful [deletion][/deletion] scene restore
"They come," he screams - the vision flies
And hapless Henry feels no more
