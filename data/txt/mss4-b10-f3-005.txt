My dear Eliza
After sending the few
lines to you on 22nd last, I received
your letter directed to post office
and am obliged for same.
I cannot say that I was surprised
at the remarks you mention, and will
tell you the reason, merely premising
that you are the [underline]first[/underline] person to whom
I have written or spoken on the
subject. When I went to Kilkenny
for a few days last summer, I was
greatly astonished at some [deletion]things[/deletion] [insertion]remarks[/insertion] I heard
there both in the [unclear]Deurock's[/unclear] home
and out of it, the purport of which
was, that I was the acknowledged suitor
of Mary; who it was originated these
I do not know, but cannot help
thinking, that there was some kind
of a [unclear]plot[/unclear] on foot, I will not say to

entrap me, perhaps the word is too
strong, but to give me a fillip if
I was inclined that way; it was bad
policy on the part of the author, for I hope,
(although vain enough God knows) that I am
not quite so bad as to be flattered in
to a proceeding which I might repent
during the remainder of my life.
In this affair I attach no blame to
A.D. I believe him perfectly free from
any imputation of the sort, nor can
I find any thing to blame myself for,
except that I no doubt paid the Ds
some attention, when they were at the
Parade last summer, but not more than
I felt myself called upon to do, from
having been on a visit with them previously,
and from the very great regard
I had for Aby. It will [insertion]however[/insertion] be a lesson
to me which I shall not forget in
a hurry, but which will not I trust
be without its use, as it will make
me more cautious in future how I
act where there may be danger of a
like occurrence. I did not intend
going home for a few weeks, even before
I received your note, so you
may be sure I will take your advice
in that respect. Here I will let the
subject rest, merely stating that my
conscience is perfectly clear and free
from self reproach in this unpleasant
affair. you may make what use
you think proper of this letter, I
hope you may have no occasion to
let it be seen but by [underline]one[/underline] or [underline]two[/underline] of thou
[underline]most dear[/underline] to me.
I received a letter from Martha
same time with yours for which
please thank her. It mentioned
the [underline]two[/underline] great marriage affairs,
when we had only known of [underline]one[/underline],
so you may think we were in
a fine way guessing who the second
could be, nor did we know until
this day when we learned the
whole affair from Dolly & Selina
to whom we paid a visit, John
(for it will not do to call him Johnny
now) [deletion][/deletion] is determined to lose in
now) [deletion]was[/deletion] [insertion]is[/insertion] determined to lose no
time, and I sincerely hope the old

adage will not come true in
his case. The girls look very
well and seem in great spirits
we intend seeing them again too
I am sorry to hear of Manliff's
accident and hope he is nearly
recovered by this time, please
write and let me know on receipt
of this, also whether there is any
one in London of my small stock
of acquaintance whom I could call
upon. We are very comfortably
lodged here, our rooms overlook
the Thames, we only sleep and
breakfast in the house, as we
make out excellent dinners and
coffee much cheaper than they
would give them to us.
Give my love to all at home
particularly my dear mother, [deletion][/deletion]
 Thomas, and all at the [unclear]Glen[/unclear]
not forgetting Martha and Fred and
believe me my dear Eliza
your affectionate Brother
Arthur
