The Santon Barsisa
The Hermit abandoned by God pursuant
to this Advice killed the princess buryed her
in a corner of the Grotto & the next day
told the Officers what the Devil bid him say.
They made diligent enquiry for the King's
Daughter but not being able to hear of
her they despaired of finding her when the
Devil told them that all their search for
the princess was vain & relating what
had passed betwixt her & the Santon
he told them the place where she was
interred. The Officers immediately went
to the Grotto seizd [unclear]Barsisa[/unclear] & found the
princess's Body in the place to which the
Devil had directed them whereupon they
took up the Corpse & carryd that & the
Santon to the Palace
When the King saw his daughter dead
& was informed of the whole event he broke
out into Tears & bitter Lamentations & assembling
the Doctors he laid the [unclear]Santons[/unclear] crime
before them & asked their advice how he
should be punished. All the Doctors condemned
him to death upon which the King
ordered him to be hanged. According[unclear]ly[/unclear] a

Gibbet was erected. The Hermit went up
the Ladder & when he was going to be turned
off the Devil whispered in his ear these
words; O Santon if you'll worship me I
will extricate you out of this difficulty &
into a Country where you shall be reverenced
by men as much as you were before this
adventure. I am content. says Barsisa 
deliver me & I will worship thee Give me
first a sign of Adoration replies the Devil
whereupon the Santon bowd his head & said
I give myself to you. The Devil then
raising his voice said O Barsisa I am
satisfied I have obtained what I desired
And with these words spitting in his face,
he disappeared & the deluded [unclear]Santon[/unclear]
was hangd-
Dear Molly.
This story informs us what a sad
thing it is to obey the word of the Devil
rather than God Tis a dreadful case
I hope we may be supported in the time
of tryal for the false one is always about
us to tempt us.
[unclear]Juston [/unclear] will go to the Mill tonight
to look at thy Garden (I believe); he gives
his love to thee. Williams wont go/he
says/this great while. I dont know the
reason he gives his love to thee & wants to
know did thou get an answer from A.
Forbes for he is very impatient
I would like such a story as thou
sent me last very well I have finished
my one & intend to bring the book
to the mill that I got it out of to see
dost though like any other thats in it.
Juston is in partners with us again
& fulfill'd the proverb Second thoughts
are best we are making a New hedge
about our Garden
I am &c W R.
Thou spelled language wrong
transport you 2000 Leagues from thence
