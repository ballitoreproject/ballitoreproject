My dear Aunt
As I expect Governess will see thee
in Dublin I seize the opportunity to write a few
lines to thee tho' it may seem soon after seeing
thee so lately, yet I have not a doubt [insertion]but[/insertion] [deletion]that[/deletion] thou
wilt like to hear from me as thou desired me to
write when I had an inclination which being the
case at present I did not like to put it off.
I suppose Mary Doyle told you that
we dined at Rheban; John Haughton came a good
piece with us, we did not go across the Heath, and
it was well we did not, for that evening a man
was robbed of a gold watch and thirty guineas on
it, and perhaps we would have been attacked also,
we got safe home about 8 o'clock.

I did not send to Charlotte Courtenay for
I thought thou could get the verses from James
Clibborn when he got to Ballitore, but if thou
chuses I will send to her for them; I believe James
will be very soon with you, as I heard he intends
bringing two of his sons to school in a very short
time; has cousin James got any more scholars since
I left home?
If thou should see Jane Stephens please
give my dear love to her, and tell her I long to
hear from her, if she writes, Governess would (I
believe) bring me the letter.
Perhaps thou wilt see Eliza Barrington,
if so, please give Eliza Gough's and my love to her.
I have to write to my father as I suppose
he will be in Town, so must bid thee
farewell thy very affectionate niece
Elizabeth Leadbeater

I hope when thou feels an inclination to write to me
thou'lt indulge it.

Elizabeth Leadbeater
