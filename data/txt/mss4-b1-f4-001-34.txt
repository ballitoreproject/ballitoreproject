Remember us very affectionately to thy husband. I much desire your
welfare and happiness, and that it may please Divine Providence
to take you and your little family, and keep you under his continued
care

Foston, 8th of Seventhmonth, 1784.
** I am often, I think, favoured with a capacity to
recommend me and mine to the protection of Omnipotence; and
I humbly trust the contrite petition and wrestling travail of
spirit is graciously heard and answered. Indeed, if merciful
help and regard were not renewedly extended to us, what would
become of us in any sense or respect? But He who is Lord of heaven
and earth, and holds spiritual and temporal blessings in his hands,
perfectly knows and sees what we stand in need of, and what is
best and most suitable for us. If, by his holy help and special
grace, we be happily preserved in his fear, walking acceptably
before him, we shall do well, and want no good thing. His Spirit
