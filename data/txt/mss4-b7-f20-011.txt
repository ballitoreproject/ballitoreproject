January 5 - 1815
Dear Madam
Tho I have been long silent
it is not from not being much
interested in the contents of your
last. I much regretted the loss
of your Friend so amiable, so useful
& so deservedly beloved. She was
the greater loss thought the fitter
to die. - It is a happy circumstance
that her sister can take her place
in the family. I am particularly
happy to hear that your Schools
go on so well on the plan that
you still call Lancasters, though

with us his unfortunate conduct
has totally blotted out that name
& we style them the British
Public Schools but however whatever
be their name they are amongst
the greatest benefits to Mankind
I rejoice much that the Children
of the unfortunate Owen Finn are
so good, so useful, & so great
a comfort to their conscious
parent. It is the best intelligence
you can possibly send me. Pray
tell Owen & the girls that to hear
of the continuance of their good
conduct will ever afford me the
greatest pleasure. Mr & Mrs Clarkson

have lately been spending some
time with us. they are just returned
from France where he went to
forward the good cause of abolishing
if possible, if not, of decreasing
the Slave trade. With every
good wish for your happiness
Believe me very sincerely yours
Frances Smith
