Yatton 6 month 15th 1782
My Dear Cousin
	That I should have to acknowledge thy most welcome & valuable epistle in a direct manner, is a favour I did not in the least expect, till I was informed by my Mother that thou wouldst allow me to write to thee again; and I hope thou wilt not think me affected when I call the permission an instance of great condescension -   I have been by many (in that respect) unfavourable circumstances debarred from the pleasures & advantages which might have accrued to me, from learning some small part in the near intimacy which subsists betwixt your family, & my father & mother; I have hardly enjoyed the least personal acquaintance, & can just & but just say, that I have some recollection of seeing thee when at School, yet I believe, nay I feel it possible for me to love & respect the name on many accounts.  I need not say how I should rejoice to accept thy kind invitation to accompany my Mother to Ballitore but I imagine thou art better acquainted with the probability of her again venturing the Passage, than myself, for she has not mentioned it to me since the yearly Meeting.      Thy remarks respecting Philosophical Pursuits encouraged me exceedingly, and I went on in my narrow track with fresh eagerness -- paid more close attention to my French, to natural Philosophy and even was bold enough to attempt astronomy, but in the last, I hardly deserve the name of a smatterer, & am nothing more in the others; thy letter continues to be a fresh incitement, whenever I read it, & I hope by continually pressing forward although by slow degrees, I may at last find beauty & utility in the pursuits themselves, to reward, & encourage me still further -- I fear lest I should never experience the Truth of that beautiful companion respecting the memory; for as the strength of an arch consists as much in ^the^ regularity and propriety with which the materials are disposed, as in their weight; so, the arrangement of the Thoughts, & several other faculties only the names of which I am acquainted, with may constitute the excellence of retention.
	Mary Davis is with us at present on a Visit, she desires me to present her dear Love to thee & Molly & to say that the sympathetic part you have taken in her affliction, has been as balsam to a wound - She accepts the copy of that Elegy thou left for her in London as a particular favour & remarks the sensibility of expression which denotes the near sympathy of its author.		A Message of this kind she commissioned me with - I wish I could have given it in her own words -- for they are words of sweetness [ stamp covers end of word]

       I am my dear Cousins Affectionate

Morris Birbeck Junior

I expect this will be enclosed in a Frank at Tottenham, so I need not mention the favorable situation of my Mothers Health
