Dear Brother
Thine of the 18th of the 6th mo we reicd.
and wear glad to hear of your wellfare and
should be glad to be favoured more often with
a few Lines from thee or brother Mason for
the distance of our habbitations doth not admit
us of conversing any other way then by writeing
which I think hath been too much neglected
by us I have writ twice to Brother Mason
but have had no answer to either of my letters
which both I and cosen Mally somthing wondereth
at thear is as yet nothing offereth for
Cosen Mally as to a place allthough I have
made application to sevorall friends in her behalf
but good places amongst frends is verry
hard to com at and as Cosen Mally is a young -
woman of a pretty genteele & toping appearance
above what is common in theas partes
for people in her sercomstance it makes frds
expect shee would not submit her self to busine[insertion]ss[/insertion]
as is genoraly expected from a servent for even
the richest amongst frends hear expect a good
deal of work from their servants and thearfore
endevour for such as have been brought up
with business whearin we find her very mu[insertion]c[/insertion]h
defisiant but have since thee came hear endevoured
to keep her to in som degree allthough
her inclination is not so much for it as I coul[insertion]d[/insertion]
wish shee and our daughter Deborah have-
been two weeks at Treeton and are at present
at Wikersley at Cosen Yatses who was cosen
Marth Marsh & are to stay thear till next
week & then to com home I could be glad to
know what Brother [deletion][/deletion] Masons thoughts are
concerning her for as nothing offereth for -
her hear I hope he will take som thought about
her for my abillyties will not admit of
of me to keep her for my sircomstances are not
so great as to admit of an additional charge

or else could do it with a great deal of pleasure
shee & Debby have been somtime at the pastry
schoole and I would have sent her a while to the
writeing schoole but shee had no inclination
to it we should be glad to see thee hear next
spring I think if I was so much disengaged as
thou art from a famaly I should have seen
Ireland before this time but a great [unclear][/unclear]
and a continewall Care for their subsistance
hath hitherto kept me allways engaged to
keep them in a tollarable manner allthough
through the goodness of devine providence
we hitherto have not wanted a comfortable
plain subsistance - neither I hope ever shall
whilst [insertion]our[/insertion] eye is to the Lord the father and fountain
of all our mercies he who provides for
all liveing cratures is still as suffitiant to
support as ever can I truely say whose life
hath hitherto depended an him for supplies
both spirritual and temporal and can at
times truely say his mercies are more in number-
then hairs of my head mey I for ever hav
them in my rememborance & be bowed in the
sence thear of to walk humbly and revorant
by before him who allone is truely worthy
of all revorance both now and for ever by
all who at any time are made sencabel of
his loveing kindness & mercies which indeed
are many to them that fear him; my wife
joyns me in dear Love to thee and sister as allso
to Brother Mason and Cosens as if named from
thy Loveing and Affectionate Brother
John Barnard
PS when thou sees Brother
& sister Bewley pleas to give
our dear love to them & I hope
to give them a few Lines in a while
