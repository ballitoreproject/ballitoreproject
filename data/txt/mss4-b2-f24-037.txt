My dear Father,


        Yesterday I was favoured with thy acceptable letter & had the pleasure of perusing thine to E: Pim first: she was growing very jealous & down at not getting a letter, but I suppose she is eased in her mind at that account, I told her I was willing to wait with patiences for an outward sign of that love I was well convi^n^ced I possessed (or to that effect) It was comfortable to find by thy letters ye go thro the visit to your satisfaction, & altho fruits at present may not be seen equal to the labour & travail of your spirits, yet it may hereafter appear that good has been done, & that it has strengthened the things that remain, which were ready to die; only for such gracious helps I believe things would be much worse in our Society, & it is a mercy Providence is continues to qualify instruments for his work & service: & it is also of his great goodness that such instruments are preserved in true humility & nothingness of self. I sincerely, & secretly wish those of the generation, who may be designed (& as on the wheel of formation) for service, when those standard bearers now extant are removed; may also experience preservation from this Monster self, & be th^o^roghly [sic] reduced by the humbling power of Truth, else they shall never be what is wanting in the Church. I notice thy judicious remarks on your feelings in places abroad, & that it will not do to judge by former sensations, also of your visit to Joshua Pims family mentioned I believe in thine to Betsy, (its [sic] no matter which, my love is so great for her, that I love to have her comforted) my desires are for the youth there making strait steps, & growing according to the will of him who has sown the seed & watered it by the visitations of his love; whatever becomes of me, I hope I desire for those who are the hope of the succeeding generation, that many may be the preserved of the Lord; I am indeed exceedingly low & cast down, & discouraged in myself, I think sometimes of Pilgrims progress (a book not of thy fancy) when he was in doubting Castle, locked up there, I have some recollection he found a Key that let him out, but when I shall find this Key I know not, or whether it is only a conviction that I have been under some deception heretofore. I am not fond of making myself the subject, it is so worthless a one, but when conversing any way with my dear parent I am apt to speak of what is uppermost. It is pleasing to hear my Brothers Children are so well recovered after the Chin-cough, our children are all pretty well, except Eliza who is gone back again ^in health^, has a sore eye & cough, I have her & Margaret now at home with me in town, Eliza is losing her fine fresh colour, but is sprightly & plays about. We are comforted with your accounts of Abraham, it brings tears in his poor Fathers eyes, may he continue like the wise Son to make a glad Father, it is a fine thing to have him with you, Brother Thomas talks of sending his Son, a sweet wellbehaved [sic] Child: he is subject to sore eyes, which has put him back in his learning, he has an issue in his arm on that account. My Mother is very poorly, seems declining much. Mary Dudley thro divine favour recovering we hope, gets up, & sits in her chair, & her little Baby likely for this World too, sleeps & sucks, & is a little curiosity lying in a basket, wrapped up in a flannel. Poor Nanny! the Season will be apt to try her: my dear love is to her, I wish her to experience the inward Man to be renewed day by day, tho ^the^ outward may be in a state of decay. As to Johny [sic] & Betty Wilson I have not much now to communication, they seem industrious, & to have enough of employment, Bettys breats is well long ago, I saw her twice at meeting yesterday
Sister Molly wrote to me about a sister of Molly Roberts that had a child some years ago, & spoke of her as an acquisition for me to get, I should be pleased to get a young Woman to assist me to stir sometimes about the house, & when the house did not want her to be ready & clever at her needle, as I have a good deal of mending to do for the family. I spoke to her sister Nelly, who said she was not handy at her needle having received a hurt formerly in her ^fore^ finger, & she could not well say much about her. I would not chuse to take a person who had so suffered in her character unless it appeared that she had witnessed a religious change, I think as my daughter is growing up very keep & sharp I ought to be careful in this respect on her account, & also having young men in the house, if I should go abroad might make me uneasy. Barcroft Haughton told me he wanted a young Woman exceedingly to assist his wife, perhaps this young Woman may have known this change of heart I mentioned, & if thus cleansed, none should call her unclean, I would be obliged to thee to mention more particularly of her. Debby Coackley [sic] has been with me for about 6 weeks past, she was engaged to live with Mary Dudley, & came on a visit to me till Molly was ready to take her, but her illness coming on Debby remained here, she has been very helpful to me, but expects a summons daily, & then I shall miss her assistance, I would not chuse to take any girl that could not sew well & quick: as I would rather be Housekeeper myself, than be confined to the needle. I am obliged to my Mother for her thought of me, my dear love is to her, & to all my ^near^ relations there: also to poor afflicted Anna.                I have written this in Noise & interruption therefore excuse it, & accept of my Husbands & my dear love  Sally Chamberlain &c. got here well & I hope home.
        Thy affectionate dutiful daughter

Cousin E: Grubb desires her dear love to both houses
