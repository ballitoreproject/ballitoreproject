Richard Shackleton to - -
Ballitore: 18th of 5th month 1756

Dear friend,
	The chief purport of this is to desire thee to let T.H. know that his brother B. lies in a very weak way, I suppose much as his late brother was held, & likely to go the same gait. Happy exchange for the innocent lads! I wish the consideration of a subject so nearly affecting him in the persons of his brothers may stir up solid thoughts in T. & awaken him to a preparation for so certain & yet so uncertain a change; & this would incline him to sobriety in words and actions, to choose the most edifying company, & avoid the conversation of such as may ^might^ insensibly leaven his mind into the profaneness, hardness & grossness of their own spirits. I know not but he behaves himself well, hearing nothing to the contrary, but as matter occurs so I write, being sensible that an innocent state, like white paper is easily stained. +++
	What ails thee that thou didst not offer thyself willingly to go to London this year? __When thou art favoured with the best mind, then thou art willing, I suppose, to do any thing, and be any thing, or any where. --But what signifies the sacrifice which obedience does not follow? Is it justice to receive earnest, and, when that is spent, devote ourselves more to our own affairs than to that for which we were hired? --Or, in other words, what signifies thy feeling thy heart warmed to this ever-blessed-cause, and thy having thoughts of going here or there, or doing this or that for the service of it, if thro a multitude of outward business clog thy heels & thy head, & dont not effectually so order it that it may not become thy Master, & thus endeavour^ing^ to serve two Masters, which we are told is impossible.
	I have such perfect love for thee that it casts out any fear of disobliging thee by the abrupt plainness of this, which I had no thoughts of mentioning when I began--I wish I may take my own share of it to myself.
