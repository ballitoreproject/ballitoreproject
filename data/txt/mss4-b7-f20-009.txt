February 1810
My dear Madam
I am much concerned to
think that your letter has so long lain
unanswered but we returned only a
very short time since from a long
journey into Scotland - the frank
will be quite at your service both to
receive your letter & to forward it
In haste, Believe me
dear Madam
Very truly Yours
MF. for Francis Smith
Senr.
