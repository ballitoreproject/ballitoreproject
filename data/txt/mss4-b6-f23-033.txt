So [deletion]Thus[/deletion] deem'd I to have closed my humble strain,
When War her sounding trumpet waked again,
And Waterloo's red field was drench'd with gore,
And Peace on timorous wing returned once more.
In those disastrous or triumphant days,
'Twas not for me my feeble voice to raise.
But now my heart, my [deletion]tongue[/deletion] [insertion]pen[/insertion] my eyes o'erflow
To wail the anguish of a private wo.
With tears my [deletion]song[/deletion] lay began, with tears must end.
For I have lost thee, oh, my faithful friend.
Oh Lefanu, veil'd in Philander's name
The applause of those who lov'd thee thou wouldst blame,
We [deletion]dare[/deletion] [insertion]might[/insertion] not tell thy worth - thy modest ear
Turn'd from the theme - but now it cannot hear,
[insertion]Nor could it[/insertion] [deletion]It cannot[/deletion] hear those groans, which burst their way,
When that loved form was [deletion]given to[/deletion] [insertion]laid in[/insertion] kindred clay,
Nor hear those sobs, which [deletion]stopped the solemn song[/deletion] [deletion]mingled with[/deletion] chok'd the solemn song
Hymn'd by young voices, while [deletion]they[/deletion] [insertion]slow[/insertion] movd along
The sad procession; for the friend who gave
[deletion]Learning & hope[/deletion] [insertion]Instruction & ore[/insertion], they follow'd to his grave.
No more our hearts thy gracious aspect charms
No more our fancy thy gay converse charms

Guiltless as gay - there sportive humour play'd
And sparkling Wit engaged in Virtue's aid
Genius with eagle eye - but how benign,
How lenient to inferior powers was thine!
Science for thee unlock'd her treasured store
And taught thy matchless pen her various lore
Yet could simplicity obtain thy love,
Wise as those w[deletion][/deletion][insertion]a[/insertion]st [deletion]all[/deletion] [insertion]yet[/insertion] quietly as the dove
Wise as [insertion]though[/insertion] thou wast - [deletion]all[/deletion] [insertion]yet[/insertion] guiltless as the dove
Oh what a soul was thine - thy [deletion]princely[/deletion][insertion]noble[/insertion] mind
Oerflow'd in boundless love to humankind
The true disciple's mark 'twas thine to bear,
Thy love of heaven, thy heavenly deeds declare,
Oh 'twas no marvel that beside thy door,
Alarm'd, afflicted, wept & pray'd the poor,
[deletion]Thou wast their generous friend for them resign'd[/deletion]
(For [deletion]when[/deletion] [insertion]this[/insertion] thy generous heart had oft resign'd
Pleasures, adapted to thy taste refin'd,)
To [deletion][/deletion]love[deletion]d[/deletion] the home of want, the [deletion]scenes[/deletion][insertion]couch[/insertion] of pain,
Bid misery hope, & sorrow smile again, (For this &cc)
For [deletion]whom[/deletion] [deletion]them [/deletion][insertion]this[/insertion] the [insertion]healing[/insertion] art[deletion]s[/deletion] of [deletion]of healing[/deletion][insertion]thou[/insertion] sought to know
And oft thy [deletion]care[/deletion][insertion]skill could[/insertion] ward[deletion]ed [/deletion]the threatened blow
