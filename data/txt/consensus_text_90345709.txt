6th Sunday. A very find and
unusually mild day. It's very
early as the trains by which we are
to go to Belfast leaves Portadown AD[unclear][/unclear] at
9 O'clock. Avy and I are persuaded
to accompany the others so we all
started off. The train picked up
numerous friends besides us on its
way to Belfast; and the meeting
was considered a large one I heard.
As it did not begin till 11 we were
there very early but by no means
the first, and should after while come
into our cloak room to warm his
feet at our snug little fire but old
John Richardson whom we met at
Blarney. As he was greeted by
so many friends and I had no good
opportunity to speak to him; I had
not that pleasure, besides I was partly
afraid he might not remember me,
Jane Hogg, M Alexander, Eliza Pim jr
Jane Pim, and Henry Russel, were
Belfast Meeting
