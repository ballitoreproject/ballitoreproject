R. D. being favoured with Samuel Fothergill's Company
in returning from London Yearly Meeting 1770 they lodged
the first Night at Ockley in Buckinghamshire & that Evening
Samuel related the following Occurrences -
That some Times, before this he was at Scarborough & observed
Admiral Tyrrel attended several Meetings of the
People called Quakers in that Place & took particular Notice
of the Solemnity & Reverence of the Admiral's Behaviour
during the Meetings especially during the Time
of Silence - One Morning after this the Admiral came
up to Samuel in the public Room before many of the Nobility
& Gentry saying Mr. Fothergill I have a very high
Opinion of your People's Principles & Practices especially
the Inwardness & Spirituality of your silent Worship,
Samuel replied, Admiral I think such a Testimony
rather extraordinary from thee (as a Man of War) concerning
us & our Principles, which are against all
Fighting, the other answered Sir, I am of your Principles
in that Particular & fully believe the Time will come when
Nation shall not lift up Sword against Nation neither
learn War any more but as every Dispensation of unerring
Wisdom must have a Beginning, so this has
[deletion]has[/deletion] had amongst you but has not reached us yet -
And as to what you hold of an Union & Communion with
the divine Intelligence I know by a happy Experience it is attainable
in this Life, one Instance of wch. now occurs to me when
I had
Samuel Fothergill's Conversation
with Admiral Tyrrell.

I had the Honour of commanding three of his Majesties Ships
of War as Commodore some time before the late Peace was
concluded account was brought in that five large French
Men of War were bearing towards us all superiour to
any of ours in Men & Guns, a Council of War was call'd
& while they sat I retired into my Cabin, alone & after
getting into perfect Silence, I heard in the Secret of my
Mind a Language intelligible to my Understanding
as any Words ever were to my outward Senses, Go
fight the French Fleet for I have deliver'd them into
thy Hand, I rose reverently thankful for this gracious
Intimation & went to the Council letting them
know we shou'd fight the French Fleet, & that I was sure
of Victory all was made ready & we engaged & the
Event proved the Certainty of this divine Intimation
we having gained a compleat Victory as set
forth in the History of that War -
