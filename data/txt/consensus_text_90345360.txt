17th Philip Charlie and I went to meeting.
We left Erasmus at Bray corner on
his way to town for Papa's keys and
letters. I saw at meeting Florence
and Jane - and at Glendruid, Uncle
Thomas and Aunt Eliz a, who had
returned from their tour last 4th
day - Fanny was there also and
was invited to spend the day here.
but could not well leave grandmamma
as Mary Gough had not returned.
Papa went over by the train to dine
there, and the car and Charlie have
just gone down to meet the train
by which he intends returning.
x 18th Papa went to town this morning.
This was a very windy day and rather
showery. Both Papa and Charlie came
out by the eight O'clock train.
Erasmus now has a tutor named [unclear]Murphy[/unclear]
from Enniskerry attending him.
he comes at about seven and stays
till nine so Erasmus has to be [insertion]early[/insertion] up.
