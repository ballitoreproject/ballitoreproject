Mt. melick 13 of 10 mon. 1790.
If the assurance of my continued sincere regard,
with a secret hope that it will be permanent,
will in anywise contribute to the ease & satisfaction of
my best beloved friend, then let me take this early
opportunity of saying so - I often regretted since we
parted that I had not concluded on returning to Ballitore
with thee, thinking that if I was at all capable
of administering any comfort to thee, thy present
situation claimed it, for I have felt abundance
for thee. I hope however that this trial will prove
for thy profit - We had an agreeable passage -
to Rathangan, & lodged that night at Tullylost, took
an early dinner next day with Wm. Pim, & then set
off for Mt.melick on a Car on Favourite where we
arrived safe about 6 oClock in the evening. Wm.
Gatehill took good care of the Children since [insertion]I left him[/insertion]. I think
& therefore I expect it will [insertion]be[/insertion] the more unnecessary
for me to make any long stay here, perhaps the
day after our next [underline]monthly meeting,[/underline] which is to be
held here next 6th. day week, I may again revisit
Ballitore, wd. that be too long, indeed, I wd. like to
go sooner, but I believe it is best wait till that is
over

over, I mean the Monthly meeting ~ Now wilt thou
be kind enough to tell me thy mind, how thou
feels towards me? Would it not be best not to say
much to others, or to look outward for help? Dost
thou understand me? I am not very communicative
to be sure, but thou sometimes makes
me out when others cannot ~ I saw my brother
John today who informed me that Medlicott had
told my Sister Harper all about our affair, & that
she now looks on me no more as a brother, that
I matter little, I wish they had as clear a conscience
towards me as I have towards them ~ Our dear
Anne Shannon was glad to see me as well as
many other kind friends. I told her nothing of
what happened, farewell my dearest Mary, &
believe me to be with continued affection thy
Wm. Leadbeater
M. Pim sends love

Turn at Killcullen
