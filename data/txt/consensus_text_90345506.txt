to please me - I dined on
1[underline]st[/underline] day at Philp's & on
2[underline]nd[/underline] at Mr Uprichard's, [unclear]Pa[/unclear]
Chandlee told me that her
brother Williams wife is very
ill, not likely to recover -
ill , not likely to recover -
Tommy Chandler has gone
into partnership with
Isaac Carroll as [unclear]commission[/unclear]
merchants in Cork - I had
a letter this evg from
Maggy & some of her [unclear]journe[/unclear]
both of which I enclose - thou
can send back the letters
when writing [unclear]next[/unclear] - it
looks as if we would soon
have them home again
& I fear it is doubtful
whether E will get much
benefit from so short a
trial of the baths - I wonder
John who is so affable generally
acquaintances there but I
aquaintances there but I
suppose the language is
the great obstacle - he must
find it slow to be waiting
to get home [deletion][unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] to old
Ireland again -
has not made more
