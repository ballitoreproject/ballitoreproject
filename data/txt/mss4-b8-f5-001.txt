My Dear Cousin
I write to thee to tell thee that I like the
book thee sent me & I am very much obliged
to thee for it, & I think Daniel Lambert is a very
fat man, I think it was very pretty to see
Anne Johnson, a poor blind woman, making
lace and poor John Statham was blind
also, and I think it was very cruel of the
people to send him of errands, and
when he would go the people would tell
him there was no such person or no
such thing wanting: my Uncle liked the
book so well that he would not part
with it untill he had read it. There
was an Elephant here in a house drawn
by six horses. I went to look at it & I
think it was very curious; it was at Wm
Walsh's it took up a bucket with its trunk
And took up a five penny and put it
in a box, & took it out again, & bolted
& unbolted a door, all when the man
desired it. Lydia desired me to tell
thee that thy garden looks very well for
the time of year & she bid me tell the

that thy mignonette is still in [unclear]blow[/unclear] she
she sends her love to thee Sarah also sends
her love to thee & she bid me tell thee
she would soon write to thee,
Father & Mother send their love to thee
I shall conclude my letter with saying
I remain thy affectionate Cousin [unclear]Mary Anne[/unclear]
