My dear Elizth
I send by G Downes, who was so kind as
to let me know he intended to go to Ballitore tomorrow
a letter for[deletion]m[/deletion] thee [insertion]from M. R.[/insertion] which came along with a Damask
table cloth a present to me from my aunt Grubbs, I wd.
he obliged to thee when thou writes to M R to say
that it arriv'd safe & that I am much obliged to
[unclear][/unclear] for her care in sending it -
The jam came without any trouble as Adam
sent his own messenger [deletion]along[/deletion]with it I think
I am now amply supplied & [deletion]for n[/deletion] lest you should
make catsup for me too I must tell that I have
made a stock of it myself - I hope thou liked
the earthenware I was sorry we could not get the
knives but Edw tried different places in vain
I long to see you again farewel for the present
ever thine SB
