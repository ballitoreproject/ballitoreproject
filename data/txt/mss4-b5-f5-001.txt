Dear friend,
M. Leadbeater
I recd. thy acceptable lines per J. C.
and agreeable thereto attended to what thou
requested. Thou need not have made any apology
for the trouble. for it is pleasant to be in the
way of serving a friend. I have not been
yet able to procure the pens but expect I
shall in some time and intend to send them
when ready. Thine is the only communication
I have had from Ballitore since I left it.
Thus I intend by Thomas Jacob, who with his
cousin and J [unclear]Pemore[/unclear] purpose going back to
School on 4 day. I much wish James' new
assistant may give him entire satisfaction.
The Jacob takes £4. 11s. 7d. to thee
an account of which at the other side.
 I am with love thy aff' friend
R Allen
