Waterford 14/1 month 1781


My dear Uncle,


        I received a fresh instance of thy kindness at the return of my host & hostess by thy valued favour & was concerned to hear of my Aunts indisposition which I hope she has entirely got shut of ere now; as also Cousin Lydia of hers [sic] & poor little Richard. Peggy Rogers is pretty well after her journey & has not been much fatigued contrary to her apprehensions at the beginning of it. I saw Sam Grubb some days ago who informed me that Cousin Peggy & the Children were well: he & his brother Joseph have formed a very snug plan for accommodating their wives for travelling by getting a Post-chaise at their joint expense each to supply horses for their separate use. Archibald has been so well as to to [sic] Cork to the Meeting he is now returned & get [sic] his health after his best fashion, his Wife was confined this considerable time but ventured out to-day. I heard it said but know not whether it be true or no that Sarah Wily had an intention of residing in Cork she has been there ever since the Meeting of Clonmel. I am sorry to hear of the melancholy account thou gives of Sally Haughton she would be a great loss to her family & friends.
        Please to present my dear love to Aunt & Cousins
                I am dear Uncle
                        thy dutiful Nephew
                                William Rayner
