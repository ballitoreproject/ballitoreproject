Dear William
Beaut[unclear][/unclear] handed [unclear][/unclear] thy letter inclosed
B. notes etc. 56.12.2 including a Bass note wch I expect
I may get off - they are not negotiable here - .
We are concerned to hear of [unclear]T[/unclear]. Bewleys' [unclear]indisposition[/unclear]
hope it may not be of long continuance - I
expect some of you will let us hear frequently
how she gets on -
Dr. Mary White left us yesterday
on her way to Waterford my Saml. accompanied
her to Royal [unclear]arch[/unclear] where she was met
by Henry Haughton - she left us under great depression
of spirits, not as her own but, her innocence
& Christian fortitude being far above
the [unclear]censure[/unclear] of unfeeling insensability - but alas
what can administer comfort - to around
later have thy Dr Molly can & I believe will
feel for her [unclear][/unclear] to her. farewell
Saml. Haughton
