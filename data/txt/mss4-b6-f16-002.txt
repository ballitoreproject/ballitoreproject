Clonmel 8 mo 30th 1823
Dear friend
Mary Leadbeater
John White intending for Ballitore
affords me an opportunity of sending
37 letters written by thy dear father which
very fully evince the affectionate and
religious intercourse which subsisted between
our predecessors & I hope will afford some
materials for the collection thou hast in
hand, [deletion]as[/deletion] I have read them over lately to my
Jane to our instruction (I hope) & we are both
of the mind that they contain fragments
worth gathering up - It was
pleasant to me to receive a few lines
from thee when thou returned the former
letters, for notwithstanding the vicessitudes
I have met with in this life my love
continues unabated if not quickened
thereby

towards my dear friends & particularly towards
[insertion]my[/insertion] [deletion]the[/deletion] early acquaintances, descendants of those
whom I loved & honoured & amongst these
I rank & esteem thy dear sister Sarah & thyself
It is just at this time 53 years since I
was placed in a state of childhood under
the fostering care of thy truly worthy Parents
& ah. how fresh in my memory is & often
has been the remembrance of their religious
care & pious instruction to myself & others
altho very sensible of falling very short
of fully improving the many advantages &
priviledges I was favoured with [insertion]under their tuition[/insertion]
Thy sister Grubb has been spending some
weeks at Clagheen & we have heard favourable
accounts of her health since she went there.
Please to remember me affectionately
to thy sisters Deborah & Sarah - thy sister Lydia
& her daughter Elizth - thy husband - my
Cousins Thos. & Fanny Bewley & Lucy - Jno Davis -
thy daughter Elizth & believe me thy affectionate
friend Isaac Jacob

If Anne Stott Junr. is at Ballitore please
hand the enclosed to her & if not please to
have it forwarded to her
