My dear friend
        I sent a copy of the enclosed letter, to Munster & Ulster provinces, in order to get a clear Account respecting the information requested, but as yet have not received any; And begin to fear I may be blamed for delaying to reply.I was thinking that the state of our province, Might answer for the Nation, & as thou & thy beloved companion are Masters of that, if thou would be kind enough to draw up a suitable Answer, as I expect thou art at present more at leasure [sic] than I am [word crossed out] being pretty much engaged on the family visit from about 10 in the Morning, till [sic] the same at nightI would be much obliged thereby& if from advanced age, or infirmity of body that may be permitted to attend thee, thy Natural faculties might fail& mine from being ten years younger, able to render thee any similar service at such a periodhope I should be ready & willing to do it: please bring the letter with thee to Mountmelick.I have compared our Dear friend Mary Watson to a live coal, taken from the alter [sic], & sent by the great Master to kindle us up to the discharge of duty: She has applied herself very closely to the service, for now near five weeks, conducted herself in a very becoming manner, by giving a preference to the service & refuseing [sic] all invitations of gratifying the affectionate part. I think she is growing in religious experience, & for Useful service in the ChurchI have given her close attendance, & cant perceive that my company was burthensome to her from the general state of the society in this city, thou may reasonably suppose our feelings were often yea very often painful& at times deep wadeing [sic] to get to any thingtho in the general she was pretty quick, lively & pertinent to the states of families & individualsfrom some little circumstances, that turned up since she came here, as also from what Jonathan [?] Davis informed thou & I, that she has some thoughts of joining on the National Visit, & think it a pity she should be thrown out. do [?] think of it.please inform Dear Abraham I received his letter & was beginning to wonder I had not before now since I saw him received some of his greek writing.
