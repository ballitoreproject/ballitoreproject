My dear E
I had no idea that I shd not see thee
at the meeting ah what is it that has
come in the way to prevent thy coming
or cannot it be removed, surely the
White washing will soon be done, it [unclear][/unclear]
be a great disappointment to me if thou
do not come I have a bed ready
for thee & I have promised thee to Sally
Davis more over, George tells me that
thou hast Fanny still or rather again
give my love to her & my dear love to MD
