137 Susy Knott spoke notably, & dear ST supplicated, I believe, excellently, wch. as it, I doubt not, came from Him who heareth prayer, ascended again from whence it came: evening meeting silent, but proved unexpectedly to me a strengthening sweet season, in which I thought I felt a grain of faith: - we went to tea to Barker Thacker’s, where were the Barrington’s, Bettys brother & sisters: Mary Stephens & R. M. Jackson were also of our company: there was an agreeable sitting, I think, after tea, in which Sarah spoke encouragingly. We went from thence, Mary & Rachel with us, to see poor Peggy Harvey, who lately removed here, from being a member of our mo: meeting: she seems in a suffering state, as to bodily health: ST was engaged both to supplicate & bear testimony beside her; - Rachel here spoke a few words: & I was pleased we went, hoping the poor woman might be comforted.
