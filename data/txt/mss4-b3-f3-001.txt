My dear Grandfather
	I now send thee a few lines, which I hope will be acceptable to thee. I shall be glad to hear from thee soon; and to know that thou, and all the family are well. Please tell my Uncle Abraham that I should be pleased if he would send my Cousins Margaret & Elizabeth here. I cannot think of anything to say at present, so conclude with my dear love, in which my dear Father, Mother, & Aunt, and Anne join me, to thyself, Grandmother, Uncle, Aunts, & Cousins. I am thy dutiful Gran^d^aughter
