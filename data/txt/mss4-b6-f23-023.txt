To the Enthusiast
"Is not Echo, my friend still repeating our song
[deletion]While[/deletion] [insertion]As[/insertion] we wander the banks of the Liffey along,
That song which the Boatmen have joyously found
While distant, yet drear Niagara has roar'd?
How [deletion]lovely is Nature reposing at rest.[deletion] [insertion] beauteous is Night - ah how tranquil, how blest[/insertion]
How glorious the Moonshine on Liffey's calm breast
While the silvery rays on the tall Lindens gleam
How gracefully wave their fair boughs in the beam!
Yon structure the wonder & work of past years
Which amid the deep shade so majestick appears
'Tis here that their country [deletion]all[/deletion] [insertion]so[/insertion] grateful & kind
For her veterans war-worn [deletion]an asylum do[/deletion] [insertion]a retreat has[/insertion] assign'd
Oh while this assemblage of beauties I view,
Methinks that the morning of life dawns anew
When all that is ardent, & all that is gay
Gives the heart its high beat & the pulses [deletion]their[/deletion] [insertion]quick[/insertion] play,
When each flower that unfolded, each bird that sang clear
Vales, [insertion]woods[/insertion] rivers, [deletion]&[/deletion] hills, all creation was dear,
When the Muse hover'd o'er & I deem'd [deletion]that[/deletion] [insertion]all around[/insertion]
That the spirits of harmony wafted each mind
Cold reality comes - She has broken the spell
[unclear]ife[/unclear] vanish, ye lovely delusions farewell.
Ah regret not Enthusiast for such still thou art
That the [deletion]glories[/deletion] [insertion]visions[/insertion] of youth must so quickly depart
Nor regret when thy prime shall be faded & gone
And when Age, & the sufferings of Age shall come on.
For with Virtue & science the day beaming bright
Unrepining shall yield to the shadows of night
To ride [deletion]Renew'd[/deletion] in a morn of unclouded delight.
