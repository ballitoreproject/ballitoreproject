by the same friends, to Henley, 8 miles, to meeting at
six, to which many came, pretty much uninvited, both

Speakman's. 12th.. Travel'd, 17 miles, to Newberry, where
others were invited to meeting, with the two or 3,
at four O'Clock in afternoon: - it was a very trying
one [underline]to me[/underline], I suppose partly occasioned by observing
rude behavior in a few fin[insertion]e[/insertion]ish dressed
folk: after meeting came, 9 miles, to Hungerford
to an inn, where we lodg'd. Thos.. Speakman came
on with us, in a clever tax'd cart.- A young man

a while in London, thinking it right to take
some meetings on his way to Bristol, coming
up to us at Newberry, Thos.. gave him a set
down to this place. 13th.. Rode, 10 miles, to breakfast
to Marlborough:- stopp'd at a professor's house
her husband I suppose a Methodist: - her sister (like
