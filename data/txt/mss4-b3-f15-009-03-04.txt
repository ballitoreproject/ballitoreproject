Dear friend,

	++++ Our poor dear Sally Haughton continues to declinethat fair & flourishing flower droops apace, & very probably will soon sink into the earth, out of which it was madeShe is attended with many symptoms which threaten her dissolutionBut when the body shall be dissolved, I believe the spirit will be with Christ, of which there are also many good symptomsshe is quiet, patient, & I believe resigned to the Divine disposalher poor sister demands the sympathy of her friendsShe takes affectionate, assiduous care of the dear sufferer, & bears the awful separation, in near prospect, with meek submission & tender sensibility +++
	Times after, persons fail one after another, & the generations of men pass off & come on in succession. I trust & hope that amidst all these changes the unchangeable Truth does not, nor will want it [?] rightly spirited & qualified advocates. A body of youth, I believe, are coming up, who having been favoured to see the beauty & excellence which is in pure & genuine Christianity, will prefer the promotion of it to every other pursuit, & as they are faithful & obedient will grown in ^a^ capacity to serve the noblest & most important cause, when you, who have been graciously helped to [page number] 30 walk in an exemplary manner before the people, & to magnify & support the law & the testimony, transmitted from your forefathers, according to the gifts & ability received, will be enjoying a blessed reward.
	++++	Farewell
			Richard Shackleton
