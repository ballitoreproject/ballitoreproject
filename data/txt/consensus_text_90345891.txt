distant mountains basking in the golden
sunshine and all the landscape enlivened
by it also - When we reached the stony
part we all sat down and partook of our
little luncheon - ie - [underline]dry[/underline] bread, corned beef
and fresh milk - all seasoned by our
appetites sharpened by the mountain air.
While thus refreshing our inner man, we
regaled the outer one with the charming views
that [deletion]la[/deletion] surrounded us - Well having
finished the repast Papa - Mrs and the chicks
started for the top. I was afraid to venture
tho' much tempted to do so - so [deletion][/deletion]
sate me down upon a heathery stone and
kept guard over Papa's coat the children's
shawls and the empty basket and milk bottles,
giving vent to my thoughts and eyes
there being much food for both and
being unmolested by anything save the
little mountain sheep which nibbled around
me ([insertion]tho'[/insertion] at a civil distance) in their own little
mountainy way - In a about Â½ an hour
the childrens voices assailed mine ears and
on looking round a I saw them all standing
up ever so high On the very top -
