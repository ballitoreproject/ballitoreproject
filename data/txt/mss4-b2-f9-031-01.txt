My dear Cousin, [in pencil] [Deborah Christy]
	+++We had very late account concerning James Doyle who lives near Cork: his dissolution is thought to be very near at hand, but many who have visited him are witness of the strength which attends him in weakness, & depart from his bed of outward languishing animated in their spirits to endeavour to follow such a pattern - his cup of consolation so overflows that he more frequently, I believe, ministers to those friends who visit him, than is ministered unto by them +++
						Believe me my dear Cousins
								truly affectionate friend
