From the same to the same

My dear Friend,

	I am much obliged by thy friendly communications; they are the genuine fruits of a friendship which I hope is nourished by something that is good, and although thou hast been (& thy family also) since I sent the last few times, much in my thoughts, I do not seem to be favoured with capacity to say a great deal on the late melancholy event.^#^ My mind has been at times dipt into a degree of sympathy, & favoured with ability to offer up a petition on your behalf: but as every soul knows its [sic] own bitterness, so it can not only be effectually comforted & relieved by digging deep, & getting to its own proper spring. Affliction indeed seems to be laid on the loins of some of you, & you are led as through fire & through water: yet if these dispensations be received in quiet, patient resignation, as at the Lords hand, they will hurt nothing that ought to be preserved, but on the contrary will tend to purefy more & more, more & more to loosen the afflictions from the world, & to prepare for more deep & ^more^ extensive service. Of what use can it be to say many words to thee? Thou hast been in thy measure acquainted with grief: thou hast in a good degree submitted thy neck to the yoke, & thy shoulder to the burden of the labour & burden ^conflict^ of this day. I am persuaded that the dedication of thy heart & the devotedness of thy spirit have been very acceptable. Leave all therefore to him that careth for his children [page number] 181 & who does not suffer a sparrow to fall without his Providence: he will (as thou leanest towards him) be thy rest & refuge in the day of trouble, & I trust will sanctify these afflictions to thee & thine, & you unto himself.
	When the keen edge of the late trial will be a little worn off, & a recollection of the life, ^&c^ manners & latter end of the dear deceased will not too much discompose thee, I would be pleased to be favoured with some account of her from thee. Though it is not well to have a life in magnifying, of multiplying, for the sake of ostentation, yet I think the memory of good domestick patterns should be preserved in a family, as a comfort to the survivors, & incitement to the youth to walk as they have had such for examples. +++

	I am, my dear friend,
		thy affectionate kinsman
