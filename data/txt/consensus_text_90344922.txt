throat and consequently staid
in bed till after breakfast. Maria
& I went to meeting after which
we returned, for an hour & then
as Maria had several commissions
to execute and as she asked
me to accompany her I did so,
so off we went & in spite
of the rain, which fell now
& then, we managed to do
all without taking a car
which we thought very [underline]clever[/underline].
I persuaded Maria to return &
dine with us altho' it was not
her intention and after dinner
at about six O'clock she
went to Dr Gordon's where she is
lodging. She seemed very
well & in good spirits, Elizabeth
Bentham who has lately had a
little daughter is pretty well &
the baby a very nice little thing
