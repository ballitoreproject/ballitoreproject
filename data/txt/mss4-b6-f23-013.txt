[deletion]Kind[/deletion] [insertion]While [/insertion]neighbours kindly press to share
With her & thee their homely fare
No she resolves to seek her mate
and share & soothe his hapless fate
The joys of her dear home resign'd
Its pleasant scenes all left behind
She takes her way, & many a friend
Will on her parting steps attend
and bear her babes who sob & sigh
And weep tho' scarcely conscious why
But now the painful parting done
She & her infant journey on
Forlorne the road these steps pursue
[deletion]But now[/deletion] [insertion]Till to[/insertion] the [insertion]dark[/insertion] prison strikes the view
How hopeless & how drear the sight
Oh Patience do not take thy flight
[deletion]The[/deletion] [insertion]Her[/insertion] tears in briny currents flow
support her soul, & calm her wo
And now the ponderous door unfolds
The wife her captive spouse beholds
Pale is his cheek & on his brow
Remorse has added weight to wo
His ardent children round him press
He trembles at their fond caress
And thou & those are lost by me
Unworthy I of them or thee
Unworthy these kind looks to see
Weep not but speak my longing ear
Would sympathy's [deletion]kind [/deletion][insertion]soft [/insertion] accents hear
Prudence & [insertion]her[/insertion] forecast vainly strove
Ah then can sympathy & love
Howe'er the generous heart expand
Disarm misfortunes iron hand
which crushes me beneath the sway
Even Hope's elastick springs give way
Ah know ye not that One is nigh
Who [deletion]hears[/deletion] [insertion]listens to[/insertion] the Mourner's [deletion]secret[/deletion] cry
Who will the drooping soul sustain
When deep repentance clears the stain
Seek Him - He ne'er was sought in vain
And while you pour the bitter tear
Behold his delegate is [deletion]near[/deletion] appear
Behold a form of noblest grace
Behold Heaven beaming in that face
High born - with Fortune's favours crown'd
Her gifts to him were blessings found
Valued but for the power they gave
To aid to comfort & to save
Led on by an unerring guide
His temperate [deletion][/deletion] wants were soon supplied
Simplicity his table spread
More pleased the hungry should be fed
Water his drink dispensing wine
where pain & want together pine
and [deletion]plain is[/deletion][insertion]humble [/insertion] his abode besure
For much he loves to clothe the poor.
Fitted thro' courtly halls to move
Or tread the academick grove
For nobler objects there resign'd
His generous, his devoted mind
Glows with the love of humankind
To the bleak [insertion]lone[/insertion] hut th'infectious bed
His frequent step compassion led
The Prisons dreary bounds [unclear]confect[/unclear]
The visits of the illustrious guest
Where'er [deletion]his[/deletion] [insertion]he turned his[/insertion] beaming eyes [deletion]was turned[/deletion]
Hope's cheerful dawn begins to rise
Now Dolon may reflect with pain
How oft she pleaded while in vain

Even Dolon saw the ray benign
Upon his dreary prospect shine
Strict in enquiry now he knew
Dolon's distress & follies [insertion]vices[/insertion] too
Wise as beneficious his thought
The surest means of succour sought
First to redeem from knavish hands
The injured Dolon's forfeit lands
Was the kind act employment then
Thus sever'd from the walks of men
His lot could comfort & could cheer
and brought the hour of freedom near
Nor were the wife & babes forgot
Their passion changed their former lot
And could the industrious, frugal dame
Her house & humble shop became
Now eighteen months had roll'd away
and Dolon still in bondage lay
Still his protecting frd was near
Prompted to instruct & prone to cheer
His heart affliction had subdued
It bore the fruit of gratitude
Temperance & Independance came
The renovated man to claim
With humble [unclear]bosom[/unclear] yet [unclear]elate[/unclear]
Has Dolon past his prison gate
And he, the delegate of Heaven
To whom this blessed task was given
He feels what all his care repays
And to his Master gives the praise
Thus my true story have I told
But why to thee this tale unfold
Thou to whose comprehensive view
Nothing I offer could be new
[unclear][/unclear] & suffering oft are found
Even on fair England's favoured ground
And veterans there of noblest name
[deletion]Wherein[/deletion] In virtues field who win their fame
[deletion][/deletion] I feel
yet warm'd with patriot feeling I must own
My wish our Heroes should to thee be known
Ah while I write one Hero breathes no more
Alas his bright & brief cares is o'er
Joseph Humphry's
It was not he who Dolon's sorrows view'd
But one with like grace, & like gifts endued
Dawson Street
Where spotless brow every virtue warm'd
Where life intruded & where converse charm'd
At whose loved name our sorrows stream
anew
Oh ever dear lamented Lefanu
No sudden intruder warm'd thy [unclear]heart[/unclear]
which Peters even tide comfort
