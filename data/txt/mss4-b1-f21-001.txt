James Naylor died in Huntingdon-Shire in the latter [deletion]of[/deletion]
 end of the year 1660, about the 44th.. year of his age: about two
hours before his death he spoke in the presence of several
witnesses these words.
"There is a Spirit, which I feel, that delights to do no
evil, nor to revenge any wrong: but delights to endure all
things, in hope to enjoy it's own in the end: it's hope is to outlive
all wrath and contention, and to weary out all exaltation
and cruelty; or whatever is of a nature contrary to itself: it sees
to the end of all temptation: as it bears no evil in itself, so it
conceives none in thoughts to any other: if it be betray'd, it
bears it; for it's ground and spring is the mercies and forgiveness
of God. It's crown is meekness, it's life is everlasting love
unfeigned, and takes it's kingdom with entreaty, and not
with contention; and keeps it by lowliness of mind: in God alone
it can rejoice, though none else regard it, or can own it's
life: it's conceived in sorrow; and brought forth without any
to pity it: nor doth it murmur at grief, and oppression: it
never rejoiceth but thro sufferings; for with the world's joy
it is murdered. I found it, alone, being forsaken; I have
fellowship therein with them who lived in dens and desolate
places in the earth, who through death obtained
this resurrection, and eternal holy life.
