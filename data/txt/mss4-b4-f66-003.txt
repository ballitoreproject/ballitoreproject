Well, dear Wm., thou cannot long more than I do to have
this weary partnership settled. If there was a large portion
falling to my lot I think I would not be against
giving up what appeared both just & reasonable, but
as it seems to me I shall be tight, or however to what
I have been used to, I should expect thou & Molly would
consider this, for altho' I have not children to provide
for, I am without a husband to succour & take care
for me: I do not covet any of your property; I confess
I [underline]felt[/underline] those words of thine, "If SS & her friends think
she should have more, why even let her have it, till she is
entirely easy & satisfied," I should not be [underline]easy[/underline] to deprive
thee; or any one, of your right; so, lest I should
ignorantly commit this errour, I am quite of thy opinion,
that is it is best " the whole business was laid
that it is best "the whole business was laid
before some judicious (friend or) friends, that understands
such matters," by whose judgment I shall be
satisfied to bide; & [underline]till this is done[/underline] think it is best
for [underline]us[/underline] to quietly go on in our present way, & leave
it, not be harassing our minds unnecessarily. And
in the feeling of that love, which I trust none of
those things will banish, I wish thee affectionately
to [underline]farewell[/underline], in [underline]every[/underline] sense of the word. S:S.

W: L.
