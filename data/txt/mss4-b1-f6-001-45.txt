Sir/
I should be ashamed of the mistake committed by my
sending my last Letter witht. Enclosing my dear Brother's,
it was occasioned by the archness of a little Boy, who
hid it at a time I giddily imagined it had (as intended)
been Enclosed; I request my most respectful
remembrance to Mrs. Shackleton, Mr. Abraham
Shackleton & Lady, Mrs. Grubb, Mrs. Chandlee, Misses
Mary, Sarah & all Enquiring friends, & that you
will please to believe me with great respect,
your much obliged, sincere, humble servant
Robert Eyre
