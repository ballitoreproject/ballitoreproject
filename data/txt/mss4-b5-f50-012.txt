Edinburgh 1 Month 8 - 1820
Thomas Fisher to Mary Leadbeater,
As I suppose thou hast seen my letter to Betsey
Shackleton, I think it needless to enter into another
detail of my journey hither, an account of the city &c &c
which would unavoidably be nearly a repetition of
the words contained in that letter, as I have not
the talent of unpacking the same thing in an agreeable
variety of forms. I do not think I was
ever in a stranger place, in which I now found
myself at home as this, which circumstance is certainly
in a very great measure owing to Joshua Harvey
being here, except for whose kindness I should
still feel exceedingly lonesome, & be deprived of
many advantages through ignorance of the mode of
obtaining them, which I now profess. But I
think this feeling of [underline]homeness[/underline] if I may use so
The common method, in my opinion, is liable to the objection of formality
by expressing [unclear][/unclear] of affection, which perhaps do not exist. Not
that I believe they are never used with sincerity, but it is the
constant custom not the occasional use of it that I object to.
But I have said enough, perhaps too much, on this subject.
I am glad to hear that the ferment of radical reform in your
little village, which appeared to be in the height of its intensity when
I was with you, has subsided into a calm, & produced happy
results, - the details of which I was glad to hear from Betsey.- I called
yesterday on Henry Faulter, delivered him Margaret Bonham's message,
&[deletion]sub[/deletion] spent about an hour very agreeably with him. - He desired
me to present his kind regards to Margt. Bonham, & to inform her
that his health is pretty good, & that he is much obliged to
her for her letter.- His spirits appear very good, & he is beginning
to act a conspicuous part in the medical society. I have heard

homely a word, is partly owing to a congeniality between
the Scotch character & my own in several aspects.-
I must acknowledge I have not their enthusiasm,
but I think I have a constitutional sobriety, which
instead of being tempered with the warmth of their enthusiasm,
is cooled down into something of a friged [underline]nonchalance[/underline],
of which I often feel the disadvantages. But
I am talking too much about myself, & will try
to turn to some more interesting subject. - The friends
here, into whose families Joshua Harvey has introduced
me are exceedingly kind & hospitable. we have been
more frequently [deletion]at[/deletion] in Alezander Cruchshank's than any other.-
They have not so much coldness & reserve as
I had expected from the idiom which I had imbibed
of the Scottish character.-
I had a letter from my brother James last second
day, by which I find that the accounts of my uncle
Christy continue to be exceedingly dull; he says, he
[deletion]continues[/deletion] [insertion]is[/insertion] in a state of extreme weakness, so much so, that
he finds it fatiguing to sit.- I am afraid he will
him spoken very highly of [deletion]by[/deletion] as to talents, by several of the members
& have no doubt that he will be raised to the Presidency. He has
very fine dark eyes, & a remarkably intelligent countenance. He has
invited me to dine with him on fourth day which I shall gladly
accept. I have not yet introduced him to Joshua Harvey but
intend to do so when I am a little better acquainted with him
myself. Tell [deletion]Joss[/deletion] Betsey I give Joss her message about Anne
Grant. I think you, Ballitorians, talk of going to see Anne
Grant & giving information about her, as if it was a simple a matter
to go to her house, & become intimate with her as it is with
yourselves. On the contrary, from the accounts which I have had
she appears to live in a fashionable style of life, & to have visitors almost
constantly at her house. A gentleman who is acquainted with
her, & who introduced Joshua to her, lodges in this house, & Joshua
offered to request him to introduce me to her, which I declined, as

not hold out much longer.-
So Edward Alexander & Thos. Todhunter were to have
been at the Carlow meeting, & of course called to see
you, I can now only enjoy that pleasure in remembrance
& in hope, & when both these are confirmed, they
are perhaps as full a compensation for the thing itself
as I could have, to this I may add the pleasure of
receiving letters from you, & from former experience,
I have ground to hope that I shall not
be neglected in that subject. Please to
return my acknowledgements to Betsey Shackleton
for the agreeable letter which I had from
her a few days ago from Ballybeaty, & to thy
Lydia for addition, which tho' very short was not
unacceptable- Betsey calls my newly adopted plan
of beginning my letters "stuff", now in my opinion it
is both simple & convenient, & neither [insertion]so[/insertion] "stuff" nor [insertion]so[/insertion] formal
as the common method. - Its conveniency aim from its
informing the reader of the letter at once, by whom the
letter is written & in as simple a manner as is possible.
I thought that an acquaintance with people moving in her sphere
would by no means be desirable to a medical student, especially to
[deletion]me[/deletion] [insertion]one[/insertion] who, like me, has a great dislike to ceremonious visits, great company
&c &c. Joshua Harvey would thank thee to inform Betsey that he
intends giving her an account of her, but he is afraid that it will
not come up to her expectations. When thou writes (which I hope
will be soon) please to inform me of the health of your invalids
thy sister Chandlee, Anne Doyle, Hannah Davis &c &c - I was glad
to hear you had a visit from Joseph & Mary Humphreys - have
they a prospect of many more private pupils. Tell thy Lydia
that she may perhaps receive a few lines from the "Land of song" but I
beg to deprecate the idea of Scotland being called the Land of Freedom, the
great mass of the people here are time-serving loyalists. Still I am
glad she has grown as steady as to be taken to be older than Sarah
I have not yet seen either Scott or Jeffrey, but I hope
soon to see both. Please to write soon. Salute my friends,
Farewell.

I think Eben L. would like to see
the essay on paying off the national
ansd. 9/2 mo
debt, & on the effects of
the use of machinery. The political
horizon has a dreadful aspect
at present, it is really a melancholy
thing to hear of military preparations
& armed associations all over
the country while the greatest apathy
prevails expecting the misery of the
poor, & the necessity of a change
in the present state of things. Can
we look to anything but a revolution
I hope we can, but am
afraid there is no ground for it
Again farewell.

Hast thou seen "Peter's letters to his kinsfolk"? I am now reading
them they give a very detailed interesting account of
what is worthy of observation in Scotland particularly in Edinbourgh,
descriptions of well-known characters such as Scott, Jeffrey &c &c
but dont mind the portraits for they are wretchedly done.

A new novel, or romance I believe has been lately issued from the
pen of Scott (as we may now [deletion]say[/deletion] [insertion]call [/insertion]the author of Waverly.) I have
read the first volume. The scene is laid in Yorkshire, in the time
of Richard Coeur de lion during his absence from England. It
