Ballitore: 1/2 month 1786


My dear Cousin,


        Understanding that there is a likelihood of an opportunity of sending a letter I thought I would make use of it to acknowledge the receipt of thy last letter though I wish us not to wait for such opportunities, nor for franks  but when the mind is a little open for a conversation of this sort, to give ^to^ each other what comes to hand, while it is fresh & warm  the expense of postage is little. Thy last (as all thine) was very acceptable  It would be a pleasing reflection to me, that I had ever been of any use to thee in any respect  but I think thou rates [sic] the value of my communications quite too high ^[pencil note] X^  doubtless thou hast felt deep concern on account of  but ^such^ repeated wounds in one part, must cause an exquisitely tender & painful sensation  It is some alleviation however that the affair is attended with several favourable circumstances  May it prove a salutary, though it may be a bitter potion!  It seems to me, as though it was the will of the great Ruler of the Universe to strip off every false covering of every kind, & lay us naked & bare, (as we really are,) before him, & before one another. There has been an evil covetousness, the wedge of gold & Babylonish [sic] garment  there has been an ostentatious parade, & an aspiring to live above the simplicity of Truth, in which is the safety & quiet  The professors of the religion of Jesus Christ, revived in its [sic] original purity, have not many of [page number] 120 them been willing to drink of the cup that he drank of; nor to be baptized with the baptism which he was baptized with  We must get lower & deeper, ere we as a people become exalted, conspicuous in glory. May such as are sensible that these things are so, be favoured with ability to wait & watch unto prayer for preservation from evil, & for strength & wisdom to walk wisely before the flock, over which by divine appointment they have been made Overseers! All our movements are seen, & known to our great Judge  he understandeth all the imaginations of the thought of our hearts  This fountain must be thoroughly & often purified; in order that what proceedeth therefrom may be sweet, savoury & edifying. A little thing defiles and unfits. So the little things are to be guarded against, as well as those of greater magnitude  the secret faults, as well as the flagrant sins  for holiness is to be the clothing of the Lords Servants, & this will not be put on any that are unclean  And indeed I often think that ^it^ is a capital favour, that the healings we are at times so clearly convicted in our minds of having said or done amiss, & that the healing stripes are so soon administered  But why do I ramble thus in discourse with thee, who I believe art more ^watchful, more circumspect & more exemplary than I am? These reflections are^ not personal, but general  probably overflowings which I would [pencil insertion] ^should^ do well to save for myself.
