To Martha Wright
Ballitore: 7/5 month: 1824
My dear friend, Letters having come this day from our English part of the family
to which we are desirous of replying, I thought of this mode of conveying one to thee, also to convey
Mary Doyle's & Eben's & Abby's dear love & best wishes. All I hope are well, & little John Wright recovered. Fanny
Bewley also I hope is rather better. Betsy & her little niece & nurse wish to return from London soon after
the meeting, & we are very desirous they should travel in company with you, who I suppose are under Saml.
Elly's protection. I hope their company would not be inconvenient to you. If agreeable I wish you would
be so kind as to arrange it, as Betsy would be diffident of proposing it herself, & it seems a pity that
Ebenezer should leave Deborah in London to escort them. I hope Anne Shannon received the parcel.
To Betsey Shackleton 4 Chester place, near the Green man Turnpike Kent road.

My dear Betsy,
I received my beloved Debhs. letter without date this day, with one attached thereto
for RSL, with another covering for George & a bit for Mary - & Melesina's beautiful poetry
which I intend to paste in Mary Tighe's poems her valued & valuable gift. Please tell Melesina
that owing to my own fault, partly endeavouring to find who wanted wheels, & partly by undue
procrastination I was too late in applying for the wheels - they were given to Thos. Trench for
the Munster tenants, of this I informed her of nine months ago. Sometimes I fear lest my letters
by way of Robt. [unclear]Latouche[/unclear] have not reached her. I intend to consider & enquire about the
selling the Ballyburnites small quantities of wool - but I should be able to inform accurately of the
price & quantity. About Limerick great good is done by loans of 5 or 10 shillings in each, or articles
of clothing repaid by weekly instalments. Jane Fennel has several of those pensioners as she calls
them & I used to go to Summerville sometimes on a 2d day morning to witness this pleasant scene. I
believe she had near 30 & not one defaulter in payment - those who did not think they could pay
repaid the loan. Rebecca Harvey slunk into the background - she was imposed upon - & was no
good - it was "sister Jane" who was the efficient person. Rebecca thinks so - while unconsciously she is
the moving spring. O when Joseph was able to come to meeting again - & he & she were seated under
the gallery [unclear]screen[/unclear] but not [unclear]closely[/unclear] - I looked on them with delight & thought of their sitting side by side
on their marriage day in the beautiful bloom of their youth. I beheld them now old but the duo
of heaven lying on them, & the serenity of their countenances if possible increasing with years. I
gazed & almost wept - when, in stomps Saml. Alexander & squats down between them! On expressing
my indignation at this, "Consider,' says Lyd, "that my aunt Harvey sate between Saml. & his wife"
Richard Allen preached sweetly to us yesterday "Work while it is day" was his text. I am glad you
are to see that great sight the London Yearly meeting. I wish Thomas Wilkinson might be there.
I am glad you saw the scene in Newgate - a description of it would match the [unclear]Hinter[/unclear], & that thine
art noticed by Eliz. Fry - thy character of her to Mary is touched with a master's hand. I hope she is known
to Melesina - I hope Melesina has recovered - It grieves me to hear so often of her being ill. We hear
that E. Fry is in a consumption. Heaven forbid! Did Melesina's advice impress Dr. Fisher?

she desired to have, & which Henry Allen took charge of. He also took letters to commit to your
care. We have continued agreeable accounts from ED & Betsy. How will they be rejoiced to see
you!
Afftely farewell
Mary Leadbeater
Perhaps it may be best to erase the address to thyself
& direct this according to Betsy's address & send per 2d post
or perhaps you may soon meet.
Susa. Grubb sends her love to you all & wishes for your safe return, & longs to see the little bud: she
came to us 4th day, & talks of leaving us in this night's coach - tho' Abm. would have her lengthen her visit
& so would we. How interesting is Deborah's account of her dear baby. I wish she was vaccinated. I hope
my friend Dr. Walker does not forget me, or the pleasant hours we have spent in East-street parlour.
Ah which of use did you expect to see in London? - & what put such a notion into your noddle? To return
to the subject of assisting the poor - the environs of a populous city afford opportunities of a little trafficking wch.
could not be carried on here. Did I tell you of the woman who set up [unclear]huxtering[/unclear] on 10 - who was so enriched
by the loan of 5 [unclear]s[/unclear]? I went to see her with Jan F. She was gone into town to Susy Herrings. She lives near Richmond
her daughter, a little girl, had charge of the house, shop & two younger children. The Shop was a window - it
contained a few ha'porths of soap, a few rows of pins, & a herring: a broken bottle, the whole side turned
to the window, & a jug without a bottom were ornamental supernumeraries. The cottage was decent -
We went into another [deletion]a stile higher[/deletion] in a higher style - the abode of Summerville gardener who is father
to my little grandson's attendant. He had 30 years ago I hear taken a little spot - built a cottage planted
a garden grafted his fruit trees, & beheld with delight the fruit of his labours - this fruit was rent from
him by his landlord, who, when his lease expired, refused his offer, took it from him & let it to another!
"[underline]Is there not a cause?[/underline]" says Peggy Abbott (stout & strong,) when speaking of the outrages committed by the
Peasantry. Is it true that one of the young blacks who accompanied Hannah Kilkarn dead of a fever? Now I
must send thee little memorials of that lovely, fine young Henry Grattan, which poor Fanny sent me
annexed to her letter - They were sent from America at different periods. He died 8/4 month
was buried next day, attended to the grave by most of the respectable inhabitants of New York, by
his two brothers, & by his schoolfellow Jacob Harvey.
And when my spirit shall depart,
A wish
And hoping heavenward peer,
Be mine a breast unknown to fear,
Pure & devoid of guile,
Be my mausoleum the heart;
Whose feelings still to honour dear,
My epitaph - a Tear.
Disdain each paltry [unclear]wile[/unclear].
A night-thought
Is there a heart can gaze at night
A heart, whose throbbing veins can burn
With coldness upon heaven;
When other's grief is shewn,
And mark its beam of quivering light
Yet proudly from observance turn
With pulse unmoved & even?
When anguished by its own.
That heart was never formed for bliss
In any other world than this.
And oh! be mine the generous hand
But is there one can fondly trace,
That dries the sufferer's eye,
With feelings warmly glowing,
That bids the smile of peace expand,
The traits of that resplendent place,
Where thousand worlds are glowing?
And soothes the murmuring sigh.
That heart was formed for purer Spheres
And brighter than this vale of tears.
And brighter than this value of tears.
