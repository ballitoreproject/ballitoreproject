Youghal 2d month 7th 1783

My dear Uncle

	As we have now pretty much fixed upon a time & plan for our leaving Ireland & finding that J. Abel is sending thee a frank i was not willing to omit telling thee myself by transmitting thee a few lines though not quite in regular course having wrote thee since the receipt of a very acceptable letter from thee  My R. G. & myself set forward for Cork last 5th day evening, reached on 6th day evening & left it on 4th day evening following  I suppose the meetings were allowed to be large, our valuable friends S. N. [?] & R. V. I believe had good service therein  I did not open my mouth in them but I often said in my heart a living Dog is better than a dead Lion sometimes a little light shone on this offering & sometimes I thought I felt an impulse without the appearance of matter to stand on my feet & according to renewed ability to visit the seed [?], but as I greatly feared there was not life enough in these offerings I was resolved not to cut [?] myself like Baals Prophets but leave the cause & myself to Him that judgeth righteously
I was attacked on 3d day morning with a severe complaint at my stomach which I am subject to particularly after more than usual exercise of mind it kept me in bed & prevented me attending meeting that day & left me very weak the next, however we concluded after dinner to set off with F. [?] Harvey & a young woman towards this place & found the air of service to me, we ledged at an Inn about half way & got here yesterday morning to meeting & are spending this day amongst our friends  J. Abels company renders our stay the more agreeable  we want him to venture with us to Clonmel ^tomorrow^ hoping when there to court him to Mt. Melick where we think to be the latter end of next week with R. Valentine as we have concluded all to cross the water together as soon as we [seal torn] after your quarterly meeting  I hope our road will be by way of Ballitore if not thine & thy families company at Mt Melick will make more easy our passing you bye at home 
Robert & J. Abel are riding out together or rather just coming in from it  Jemmy is poorly but does not look ^worse^ than last Province meeting I wished much for Sister Peggys company 
with us ^in^ this little excursion but she thought prudence forbad it  I feel myself very affectionately attached to her with not only sisterly friendship but sisterly freedom
I am with the salutation of dear love ^to^ thy self & household in which my R. G. unites thy affectionate & obliged S. Grubb Robert
PS Our aged & honorable friend E. Richardson desires her love
