My dear E - I have just recd the sweet pieces some
of which I had either never heard of or had entirely
forgotten, I shall take great care of them, I saw
Fanny Lefann to day in her poor little lodgings at
Sandy mount, she has not got her business finish'd
yet but hopes to have done very soon & to go to
thee in about 3 weeks, she desired me to tell
thee that both she & Harriet were greatly
obliged to thee for thinking of them, Harriet
has only just return'd from Burrisakane
& is so fond of it that she means to return
to Lyssy as soon as she can I mean [unclear][/unclear]
to Lyssy as soon as she can I mean [unclear]to[/unclear]
see her the first spare day I have, I heard
from Limerick to day they are all well there
E & D arrived safe, - Alas poor Mary Anne
did [unclear]gathon hear[/unclear] any particulars of her illness it
is most likely she wanted comforts how many
children did she leave! tell me all thou hast
heard of her, Emily recovers slowly she has had
the kindest [insertion]& tenderest[/insertion] of care, she is still unable to stand
or even to sit except for a short time, she
is gaining her flesh again her recovery is
most wonderful, - W D is gone, she was
almost wholly taken up with M Newman while
she staid & some of her other friends were
Jealous with her, I found her just the
same & had great pleasure in the
2nd mo 1828
few hours we spent together thou'lt be glad to hear we are all pretty
well here Richd recovered at the Glen where he spent a week
