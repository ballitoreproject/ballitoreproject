My dear sister Mag
You are all very lazy at R, as I have
not had a line from any of you, since those which came
by Moses -
I am daily expecting to have the pleasure
of seeing thee, with our dear Mother & Sister Gough in
town; - let me know when you are to come; I do
hope by this time, that thee has got leave from my
dear Father to pay us a visit here. - I understand
that they expect thee to lodge with them in Barrack St.
-but it will not be, at least, while my Mother & sister
stays in Dublin. -
You may have been fine Ramblers since I
left you, tho indeed we did pretty well in that way
whilst I was amongst you. - I beg that some of
my dear Rouske Friends will inform me soon of the day
which they expect to be in town, in order that I may meet
you at the Boat. -
Remind my Father of sending me the
directions about the Jack, which I wrote about before
and bid him to be particular in the distance that there is
between

between the place where it is to be fixed and the tire.
I hope our dear Sally's health is getting
better, since her arrival amongst her friends, and her
return to the shades of R. - May she and all
of my dearest friends there, each experience a shade of
a safe retreat from every sorrow of life. -
Bid each of the Girls to pardon my not now
writing to them, and to believe that I frequently, very
frequently indeed, have them in the foremost remembrance. -
With love and duty to my ever honored
Father & Mother, with my dear dear sisters, I remain
their affectionate -
 - R. M. -

- have you got it into your heads that I am
growing very saving, as I write so often on so small
a scrap of paper as I do now?
