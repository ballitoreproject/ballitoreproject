Dublin May 14th 1828
My dear Elizabeth
Thos Green's Attorney has called on
me to know what steps have been taken towards
giving him a renewal of the Premises in Cale Alley.
I told him that as far as I knew the minds of
the parties concerned they did not wish to renew
their Interest therein [deletion]and[/deletion] [insertion]or[/insertion] make themselves in
any way accountable for the rent thereof.
He thus prefered that they should assign their
Interest over to his client and then put [insertion]him[/insertion] & Thos
Greer into their shoes, by which step he will
be entitled to the renewal which the Widow Pallin
now offers and we shall be clear of that
part of the Dublin property altogether. Cha'-
[unclear]Fanpet[/unclear] recommends this proceeding strongly
as it will [deletion]be[/deletion] probably the means of freeing us
from a concern from which some loss and
and a deal of trouble accrues. Greer is also
I am informed willing to pay the expence
of said assignment. If you, Deb, Rich'd & Eben
agree to the proportions with me, a joint
letter to that effect and we can then procure
Lydia & James Assent thereto. If there is not some
arrangement made very soon regarding this
Cole Alley concern and that of Earl H I must
withdraw myself entirely from having any
thing further to say or do about them. His

extremely unpleasant to [deletion][/deletion] be receiving
continual applications from persons who
seem willing to do what is fair and to have
no [insertion]satisfactory[/insertion] reply to give them. It is likely that Grier
will [insertion]be[/insertion] quite satisfied without aunt Sally signing
the Article so that her assent is not likely
to be necessary. My opinion is however that
she ought to be informed of what we propose
not in such a manner as thereby to admit
she has any right to interfere, but to give
her the favor of doing so if she chooses and
to shew her it is not intended to conceal
any thing from her. It is a pity that
there should be so much difficulty in settling
a matter of such minor importance.
I recd your letter of the 11th Inst. When I
wrote to you about the fee demanded by [unclear]Parker[/unclear]
I thought it was only one guinea for each lease
but I find it is two guineas each. If you
think the sum too much for your own
lease considering the value of the holding
you might write to Plunkett about it, you
will also be subject to Ardills wits. I have
got Lydia's draft of Lease but she has yours
till I hear from you. Do not depend on
me at all respecting the manner in which
these leases are drawn, I could not take
upon me to judge of them nor have I read
them but as Parker has made some alterations

perhaps it would be better for me to send
them down to you again till you compare
them with the originals. If I should do so
when you are returning them to Ardill
you might state to him those points
to which you object and on which you desire
he should be most particular. It would
be well I believe to inform Lydia & James
that their draft Leases has been with
the alteration [unclear]therein[/unclear] approved of by Jno
Pinker on the Part of the lessor and to get
their further distant directions as to whether
they will leave every thing to Ardills. I
wait for [insertion]further[/insertion] orders from them & you. You [unclear][/unclear]
I believe [unclear]just[/unclear] till you give notice to [unclear][/unclear]
and this must be particularly [unclear]worded[/unclear]
as the case may be
Please tell Eben I got his letter and that I
shall not be able to leave home so soon
as I expected. When he returns from the
South I hope to hear from him. Will
you when you write let me know
whether H Williams has bought any
any straw for us? and what progress
has been made in the ditch behind
the row of houses. If you [unclear]ask[/unclear] for a
notice to quit to be renewed on Corgriff
and that I can be of service let me know
yours affectionately EB

I have communicated thy letter to Eben D.
and R.S.L & we are of opinion that the
act of assigning our interest in Cole's Alley
would be an act of possession therefore
might hereafter subject us to be called upon
for the rent. I thought it was agreed that
we should leave the matter as it is & let
widow Pallin seek the rent due on the
Elizabeth Leadbeater
Ballitore
premises, & let our remand lie by - She
will eject T.G. most likely if he won't
pay. J Wright paid long since a renewal
fine to widow P. which we must lose of
course. T. G. is a wily man, well versed
in, & strongly attached to Law therefore
the less we have to do with him the better.
Any thing that could not be tortured into an
act of possession we will all be willing
to do to allow T. G. to get a renewal.
