My dear Elizabeth
what Glazebrook owes for Insurance which
I will thank you to hand him and tell
him we would be obliged to him to pay
it to you. I expect that we have arranged
matters with Purcell about the Concerns that
Eben had, will you put the Latter in mind
of getting [deletion]some one[/deletion] [insertion]a person[/insertion] to measure some of the
ground at the Inn for us which he is so kind
as to say he can do, and without which the exact
rent due by Mr. Glazebrook as per Doyle cannot

be ascertained. TG however need not
want for that to pay his Rent for the Inn
and that part of [unclear]Penn[/unclear] leased which he holds.
I should before this have called at the [unclear]Street[/unclear]
office about Legacy duties but you will soon
hear from me on the subject I hope. your
affectionate EB
