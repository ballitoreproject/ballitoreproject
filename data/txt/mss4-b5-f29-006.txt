My dear Cousin
I received thy most acceptable & long wished
for letter, together with the poem thou wast so kind as to write
me, for which I am exceedingly obliged to thee, & tho' I thought
them long of coming, yet a knowledge of thy goodnature & obliging
disposition, prevented me attributing the delay to an unwillingness
to comply with the request I made thee, tho' many
an one in similar circumstances would at least have put it
off longer, indeed I could hardly have expected that (in the
midst of the happy sensations you must all feel on acquiring
so valuable an addition to your family, which along
with many other advantages procures you a retreat from
your arduous employ) thou would be so very mindful about
the concerns, or have such sympethetich feelings for the distresses
of an absent friend. I think there is no occasion for thy apology,
I can see no blemishes in thy performance, if I did should
most readily pass them by: In my opinion there is a gravity
& solemnity in thy poetry, free from those flights of fancy
which Poets usually indulge themselves in, which renders thy
elegiac writing particularly pleasing to me, but everything

thing from my dear Molly whether prose or verse is always
very acceptable to her Peggy.
We still remain in the tortures of suspense with regard
to my dear Brother, but alas I fear there is little reason to expect
his recovery, he has been rather worse for some time past, I believe
the Physicians are quite at a loss to know what his disorder
is, but seem to apprehend [deletion]that[/deletion] "he has some of his father's complaints,
that his lungs are also slightly affected, but that
there can be no considerable obstruction in that part as he
has so little cough difficulty of breathing or any other [unclear]hectic[/unclear]
symptoms," what he complains chiefly of, is great weakness, especially
in one leg, besides a very delicate stomach. Oh that
it may please Almighty goodness to restore again to us this
darling child, ah my dear if he be taken away so soon after
his poor sister, what a severe trial, such reiterated strokes must
undoubtedly sink my dear Mother spirits exceedingly did not
a superior invisible Hand support her under them.
John's dear love attends thee, he would I believe write to thee if
he was able. I do think thy Brother's constancy & all
the racking doubts & anxious fears he must have endured
while in a state of suspense, are now fully repaid by obtaining so

amiable a consort, [unclear][/unclear] & affability of disposition
which I understand she possesses so great a share of, is exceedingly
engaging and cannot fail of pleasing both ones own family, & strangers:
If there be such a thing as happiness in this world I think
it is the company of such an one, I know it by experience, for I
never enjoyed such refined pleasure as when I had the company of
sweet Molly Gough last [unclear]spring[/unclear], who also has a large share of these
as well as many other agreeable qualities.
Poor S. Nicholson continues very ill, tho' she has been
rather better for a week or two past, but we have not any expectation
of her recovery. I believe I must hasten to [insertion]a[/insertion] conclusion
& run over to see her as I have not been there these two days.
I shall therefore request thee to present my dear love to thy
Father, Mother, Brother, & Sisters in which the [unclear]amiable Lydia is[/unclear]
included, & also to my Grandmother, with a large share to thyself
from thy ever affectionate cousin

I am ashamed that I have so long delayed
writing to cousin Sally, but intend to do very soon.
