Bountiful Hall 19/1 mo. 1772
Dear cousin,
I received thy letter & hope
thou wilt excuse me for not writing to
thee before now if thou wantest
to know what hindered me I'll tell
thee, it was want, one time for want
of pens & another time for want of paper
but I now have got paper on purpose
for writing to thee
I've news to tell thee viz.
1sths The boys have got a post bag & write letters
to one another, this morning my
uncle got some of the letters that they
wrote one to another & found [insertion]some of[/insertion] them wrong
spell'd & told them it might improve
them greatly.
Doleful news
2dly. I was in the parlour last night
my uncle went out & smell'd Tom Trott
at last he found some & threw it into the
fire It was White's he forbid it before
& so had no compassion.

3dly
A little while after or at the same
time Molly Fletcher came into the kitchin
& the man that came with her
gave him a letter from her [unclear] quondam[/unclear]
mistress up saying "that she bore with
"her till she could bear her no longer"
& so parted with her my uncle went
out & told her he would give them no entertainment
that would not behave
themselves & said there was the door
she might go out as soon as she pleased.
This is a long letter in recompense
of the letter I mist sending
last week so adieu.
I am &c&c
