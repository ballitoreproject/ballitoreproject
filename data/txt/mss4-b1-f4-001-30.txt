My Dear Lydia,
A young man, who appeared to be in a decline,
wanting and desiring the means of going hence to his uncle's
near Athy, I gave him permission to ride Abraham's beast
thither. If he should grow worse, be pleased to have him taken
care of, at thy house or mine, as most convenient; and let him

be forwarded on his way, when he is able. Thou seest how free
I make with thee: it is because I love thee with a true paternal
affection. Hitherto I have been satisfied with my coming hither.
I find various weathers in the atmosphere of my poor mind, in
the course of one day: whatever the reason is, I cannot get to [underline]write[/underline]
as I would wish; and I know thou wouldst not have me steal for
thee, nor traffic in unfelt truths. Farewell, my dear child: may
the substance of that which is good, unmixedly good, be thy sustenance
and support, both in the day of prosperity and when the north-wind
blows on thy spices. ** Thou often, I doubt not, puttest the sweet children
in mind of me. I am my dear Lydia's affectionate father R. S.
