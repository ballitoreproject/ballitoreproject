Carlsruhe 9th
August 1846
My dear Mrs Barrington
I had fully intended
to write to you whenever my plans with
regard to W.E. were in any degree matured
I hope to be able to meet him next
Month Thomas has given me a half
promise to come over which will
be great joy to me particularly if
Eliza comes, now I was thinking
as there is so much of the journey
could be made by water that
perhaps you could come with them
it would delight me very much
& might induce Eliza to come who
Jane sure will not like to leave
you. I think you could manage
it very well & if not perhaps I
may not see you for half a year
or may be a whole one & I would
be very sorry, I was beginning

to long so much to see you all
that I had half made up my mind
to go home & again I thought it would
not be prudent, I dream of some
of you almost every night Edward
particularly & a few nights ago
of Richard I have some hope I may
see both Edward & Richard in Germany
I liked France much better
than Germany so far as I have seen
of both, I dare say the Germans would
be better friends, more steady, kind,
& disinterested but it is much more
amusing to travel among the French
they are so lively so gay so lighthearted
so unlike us, & every thing
in France is so strange so tasty
so extraordinary, in Germany not
very unlike ourselves I sometimes
forget I am in a foreign country
& they are all for business, but they
are more confiding than the French
you would find it difficult to get the better
of a Frenchman in a bargain, I think you
could easily cheat a German for he does
not suspect you, we had a remarkable
instance of this yesterday, my brother wished
to cash two bills [deletion]my[/deletion] Thos. sent him which
were payable to himself, he & I went to [deletion]a find[/deletion]
a Mr Fowler whom we had become acquainted
with accidentally in the street, he offered to take
us to a money changer & we went with him
to this friend of his to get our bills changed
& the money [insertion]to the amount of[/insertion] 50Â£ english was handed out
to us on the instant in Prussian money
without one question as to identy, we were
not even asked to show our Passports & we
had hitherto found it a matter of great difficulty
to get money changed & nearly
despaired of it in Paris, Rothschild
refused to do it even with our shewing the
passports unless someone in Paris could
vouch for us, yesterday the German broker
did not even ask Mr Fowler if he would vouch
for us, we went a few days ago to an opticians
in this town to get the arms of Anne James
spectacles taken off & a new pair put on that
would hold them tighter on her head, for they

had lost their spring. The lady of the shop
took the spectacles in her hand bowed the
arms of them by rubbing them gently
through her fingers & giving them a bend
she said this was all they would require
& when they became straight if she would
do the same thing again it would
have the effect, & so she lost her job
I do not think there are many French
shopkeepers would have done what she
did. Mary sends her love to you &
desires me tell you she sent you a
newspaper from this town, did you
get it? it contained a notification
of our arrival at the Reinischen
Hof did you see it. I sent one to
Edward. give our dear love to Mrs
Fayle I would like very much to
go over & see you all for a month
Do come over to me ask Manliff
to come I wish it very much
give my love to him & tell him
so. I am almost afraid yet to allow
myself to look forward to meeting
W.E. next month so many things

may occur. I hope some of you will come to me
We are sadly annoyed here by the gnats they bite
wickedly I have about a dozen large lumps
at present on my face neck hands & arms
they are very small at first, next day they are
a little itchy next day sore & itchy, & grow very
large as large as bug bites & it is more than
a week before they disappear & while the old are
going new are coming, but James has been in a
sad state with a very serious extensive breaking
out on his face hands forehead ears & particularly
in his beard & whiskers he has been confined to the

house since this day week with it. we expect
to move on to Dresden next week - how long the
journey will take us I know not - I dare say a
fortnight, we hope to contract with a persons who
hires out carriages to send us all the way going
about 40 english miles a day, this will be pleasant
if we can manage it the reason we wish to do this
is because Mr Fowler can make the bargain for us
& knows the person who keeps the carriages & when
we leave this we will be at a loss for the language
& for a friend. give my love to all your boys & remember
me kindly to Mr & Mrs Cole when you see them
when you see Thomas or Eliza ask them did Mr Todd
ever send them my grandmothers picture I wish
they would ask him about it. Farewell my
dear Mrs B I do not despair of your coming
over to see me yours Most afftly
Bessie S. Henry
