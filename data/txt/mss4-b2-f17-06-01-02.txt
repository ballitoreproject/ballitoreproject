My beloved friend,
As I was accompanying my wife in her chaise (sohes cum sola[?]), going to our last monthly meeting at Carlow, I called at the Post-office in Castledermot, & took up thy narrative, which afforded us singularly agreeable entertainment the rest of the way. It was exceedingly kind of thee to give ^me^ so copious a history, & so minute a detail- [insert in grey] ^of your journey^ [crossed out in grey] I am much obliged & gratified by it. By this excursion [insert in grey] ^wherein^ I doubt not but ye would confirmedly learn the sound sense & significance of the Aphorism Use strength & have strength  ye would renewedly experience, that to follow the little glimmering of light, & whatsoever the hand findeth to do, to do it with the present might, though that might might [sic] be as weakness  ye would feel that this was the way to grow from strength to strength in capacity for religious service. I am glad to have thee & our dear E.P. paired together by the great Master, who at the first sent his disciples two & two before his face into every city & place whither he himself would come. he knows human weakness, & the infirmities, both of flesh & of spirit  that two are better than one - & that these two being united to him, the threefold cord is not quickly broken  It is a happy circumstance, when matters are so ordered, for one little fly mars the precious ointment  one gathering (collecting, accumulating) gourds from a wild vine & shredding into the pot, spoils the mess for the sons of the people prophets. I hope the support & supplies administered during your engagement in the service, as well as the comfortable serenity since experienced, will encourage you both to proceed, & quietly & devotedly step into the field of labour when it is pointed out by the great shepherd & the door is opened ^to enter^ in. There has (I am afraid) been too much of an inactive, indolent spirit, growing & spreading over the minds of some, who had received gifts, to the hurt & wrong of the cause, the great, important cause of Christianity & to their own irremediable wounding, & irretrievable loss. May the harms of others strike a terror into [page number 277 in grey] those who are yet mercifully preserved alive, though in humility, diffidence & godly fear.
+ + + Time brings forward the solemnities of our great National assemblies in this & the neighbouring land, & some of us may probably meet in consequence. May our spirits be rightly seasoned & qualified, so as that we may fill up our several department with acceptance! David was well aware of the necessity of being cleansed, as a preparation for acceptable offering, when he said, I will wash mine hands in innocency: so will I compass thine altar, O Lord  That I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving, & tell of thy wondrous works.

[grey line sectioning I remember to divine economy with the word omit]
I remember our beloved brother Samuel Neale, when he was among us, used to say, on an agreeable co-incidence of circumstances. We have just hit the joint  So I think your having got through your business, so as to be on the spot, when the spirit of our dear friend took its happy flight, & also to be at your general meeting at Clonmel, was ordered in a remarkably favourable manner. And no doubt many things respecting us are arranged & disposed by Infinite Wisdom & Goodness for our benefit, though [insert in grey] ^we^ poor short-sighted creatures are altogether ignorant of the wonderful plan of divine economy. Thou well knowest, my dear friend, that crosses, disappointment & afflictions are necessary & salutary for us  that bitters are ^as^ suitable as sweets to ^be^ mingled in the cup - & the rod, as well as the staff, is administered to comfort (i.e. to strengthen) the mind. Well, go on thou, beloved friend, doing the will of thy Father which is in heaven, & having been, in unutterable love & condescending mercy, called out of the world, its corrupt ways & false worships, proclaim to the world what thou hast heard & seen & felt & known of the religion, the reign & government of Christ  As too many of the bidden guests, the natural branches of the family, make excuses, & will not come to the Lords supper; by the precious prevalence & holy energy of living Gospel-ministry compel them to come in, not only the poor, the maimed, the halt, & the blind, who dwell unnoticed & obscure, as in the streets & lanes of a populous city, & who may be more readily persuaded & brought in  but those that are in the highways, the profession of the Religion by law established, hedged about & defended by human policy & human force  for the gracious purpose of the universal Father of mankind is, that his house shall be filled  O may the subsequent determination be mercifully revoked or avoided, For I say unto you that none of those men which were bidden, shall taste of my supper. We all join in affectionate salutation to thee & thy husband, & in good wishes for all belonging to you. I often secretly salute thee with sympathy & brotherly love  in which I now bid thee cordially
Farewell
Richard Shackleton
