My dear Father,


        I received thy welcome lines, conveying an account of thy journey home, & of all your welfare, but we are concerned to find our dear Mother continues feeble, thou does not say whether you have any prospect of visiting us before the Summer is over, perhaps the journey would be useful to Mother, & we would endeavour to take care of her during her stay with us, having a large house pretty airy tho in the centre of a bustling town. Our family are all pretty well at present, a great favour indeed, Samuel active as usual, & Thomas finely, poor Robert Beeby was soon removed, his Mother came to him, & accompanied his remains to Cork there to be interred, I understand he left it in his Will to be buried there, it appears he had intervals of reason & recollection, but was often very high & delirious, supplicated much, & expressed nothing unbecoming, I believe he is safely landed where the wicked cease from troubling, & the weary are at Rest I often regret not seeing him in his sickness, but his fever was accounted so putrid & malignant that it seemed imprudent to go to him. Anne & Richard are now in Waterford, on a visit to their Aunt Strangman, she presses their continuance for two weeks, but we wish Richard not to be kept too long from School, if he was here might perhaps have gone in company with Isaac & Jane Jacob, by whom I intend sending this, they can inform you respecting their own family, & that poor Betsy is, & has been much ailing, we hope she is better, & much desire her mending in her sweet sisters absence, who I believe is at present in a trying spot, between duty at home & abroad, a little living Faith can give the victory, & as formerly remove the mountains, which I hope will be her support. There have been letters from our other dear friends Mary Dudley & E: Pim, with some account of their travels to London, having to scatter the seed (its [sic] to be hoped) as they moved along, mention made of Edward being clothes ^with^ good authority, by their letters we may suppose them at Dunkirk to day, John & Mary Hutton dined with us to day, John was complaining much of pain in his stomach I think, he seems dull amongst us, their Son was somewhat ailing too, but is better & very sprightly. I think their visit seemed very short to us, I often regret that it is over, it was long a coming, very pleasant in expectation, (pleasant also in enjoyment) but very transient, & did not satisfy me, as I long for more of thy company & the help of thy remarks & conversation, which I get so little of now, expect [sic] when favoured with thy letters; we are a poor sort of people here at present, it would be well if our poverty was of that sort, to whom is the blessing. I understand by a letter from Cork that Mary Ridgway, Jane Watson &c. are daily expected to Cork, perhaps may be there now, if so, I hope we shall get to see them here on their return home
A letter from Waterford mentions George Penroses wife being delivered of a dead child. Betty Wood of this place also had a dead child a few days since, also Richard Daviss wife.
        My Samuel joins me dear [sic] to you all, my Brother Abrams & Williams families included
        I remain thy affectionate
                Margaret Grubb
