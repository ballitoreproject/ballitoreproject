Jossy having spent
about half an hour
shelling peas - got
the [unclear]Lizzie[/unclear] man and
the old outside car
and bringing little
Dick with us took a
very pleasant drive
through Sir G Henderson's
and Powerscourt.
and were home again at
1Â½ O'clock. After
dinner we spent in
various ways - Avy
and Charlie manufactured
in the shape of a kite
thinking the wind
which was rather
high would afford
something
