Glendruid
Riva Aug 8 / 47
My dear Madam
I have often
been thinking of sending you
a few lines, just to tell you
under my own hand that
we often think & talk of
you here - and are often
reminded of your glen
by the glen in which we
are here situated: of the
two, yours is I think the

prettiest, but this by
far the largest - the
sides of this glen or
rather valley being formed
by immensely large & steep
mountains, which look
well enough by day when they
are rendered cheerful by the
light of the sun, but at night
have an awful effect -
& overpower the mind with
a sensation of horror -
shutting out a great portion
of the sky all round. Indeed
it is a great objection to this
place even by day that the
sun is entirely hid by the
mountains from 3 oClock out,
& that therefore there is no such
thing as a sunset properly so
called at Riva: We like the
people, and believe the climate
is good, especially in the
autumn & winter, but in the
summer the heat is very considerable
& of that damp kind
which oppresses so much: like
the steam issuing from a hot
bath. Before rain this damp
heat is almost intolerable:
after rain the air becomes pleasant
again, & continues so until rain
is again brewing, when the heat
again becomes excessively damp
& disagreeable - A free blowing
air or wind such as is so
common in Ireland is quite

unknown here except in spring
(I am told) when it blows off the
lake - There is never any west wind
and never can be any west wind
here in Riva. It is perfectly
sheltered from the west being close
up against the perpendicular side
of a mountain some thousand
feet high. Few strangers ever stop
here, more than a single day, tho
a good many pass through - I dont
think it will ever be a favorite
stopping place for the English or
Irish because it is so close & shut
in on all sides except towards
the lake - There is not a single
pleasant walk in the immediate
vicinity of the town - We like it however
because by the greatest chance in
the world we have happened to make
agreeable acquaintances here & it
is very conveniently situated with
respect to Venice, Verona & Milan
Catharine is grown very big & strong -
working away at learning the language

and at drawing in both which she takes much
pleasure - Ann Jane is stouter than she was;
Both desire to be kindly remembered to you -
also to Mr & Mrs Malone - It gives us great
pleasure to hear often of you & them in Eliza's
& Mama's letters as well as in Mary's. Indeed Mary
seldom writes without telling us something
about you. At such a great distance it is
always pleasant to us to hear of our home &
old friends - We think of remaining here

a little longer and not leaving this in September
as we had intended - Catherine
says we will never meet again on
the continent so kind friends and no
where in the world so good a drawing
master - We hope to hear that your
health continues good, and Mrs Fayle's
of whom also Mary sometimes writes
to us - I am my dear Madam
very truly your old & obliged friend
James Henry
