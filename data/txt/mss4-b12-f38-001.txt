I now begin to address
my dear Kitty, knowing
a line from me will not
be disagreeable to my dear
Friend, indeed thou art
more partial [insertion]to me[/insertion] than I deserve.
I miss thee greatly, & often
wish for thee. I ride out every
day; the doctor said I must
either go to Bristol or M[unclear][/unclear]
I do not know which I am
to go to, but I must go to
one of them soon. I find
my health & spirit fast
declining, & believe I shall
soon be mingled with

my native dust. I believe
it would be best for me
to be taken in my Innocence
tho' indeed 'tis with sorrow
I own I am not so Innocent,
 as I ought, for my dear Kitty
I would wish to live. do
not be concerned at this
talk perhaps I may get
over this Illness as my
sister Hannah did. does
thou remember when she
was in a consumption.
I have something to
tell thee but dont, for

thy life tell Jenny; it is
sister Hannah went to
take a walk & I suppose
there are some robbers
about, one of them met
her in a field, & wanting
her to marry him & come
with [insertion]him[/insertion], upon her denial
he drew a knife & wounded
her in three places -
in her arm, in her leg, & in
her side, but the surge
says they are not dangerous
but if the one in her
side had been an Inch
