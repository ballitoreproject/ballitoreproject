28th. Papa staid out to day which was a most
beautiful one - I expect Margt out to morrow
evening. Papa and Mama intend
going to town before breakfast, as they are
going down to the South by the ten O'clock
train.

Papa and Mama left this at 7½ for town
Avy and I set to work after breakfast this
morning and pulled [deletion]5[/deletion][insertion]4[/insertion]¼ lb of raspberries
which with Philip's 1¼ made 6 - Avy
I may say made the jam which was
very good-. Had a letter from Polly
who expects Papa and me down at the
[insertion]her[/insertion] Cattle show time which will be next
Tuesday week. I wonder whether I shall
go or not. Margt came out this evening
by the five O'clock train to spend
a day or two out here before Liddy goes
to school which will soon be now.
30th.. Here I am all alone sitting in the
library - Margt Philip, Liddy, and Avy
have gone to meeting. It is a lovely
mild morning - Oh just think this
