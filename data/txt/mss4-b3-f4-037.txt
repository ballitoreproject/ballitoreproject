From Sarah Grubb (Robert) to Richard Shackleton.
[words crossed out]
Dictated by her [words crossed out] 4/12 month 1790, on her death-bed, to Eliza Pim, at Springmount near Cork, where she died 8th of the same month
	When I heard thy salutation read, my mind was convinced that it sprang from the deep & immortal ground of religious sympathy; for the baptism, into which my mind has been introduced since I returned home, could not have been ministered to, but from so sacred an unction  It met me (though apparently out of course) in the right time, being under impressions, which make time & circumstances of little account, compared with the unlimited consolations of the Spirit, or a preparation to receive them at the divine hands. My soul, though encompassed with many ^manifold^ infirmities of a very afflicted tabernacle, can feelingly worship, & rejoice in nothing more than this, that the Lamb immaculate is still redeeming, by his precious blood, out of every nation, kindred, tongue & people, & making a glorious addition to the church triumphant, whose names will stand eternally recorded in the book of life. I express not these [word crossed out] things from a redundancy of heavenly virtue, but from the soul-sustaining evidence that amidst all our weakness & conflicts of flesh or spirit, an interest is mercifully granted in him, who giveth the victory over death, hell & the grave. I have been afflicted beyond what I can describe since I came to Cork, but the violence of the storm is a little abated since last evening: how it may be, whether increase or decrease, remains wisely amongst the hidden things. As I am not able to dictate much more, I leave the particulars of my illness to be more fully related by my beloved Eliz: Pim, who with dear Sarah Lees are here on a great & good work. They will (I hope) find their capacities often renewed to draw water out of the wells of Salvation. Their being detained in Cork at this time is a comfort to me, even when I dot see them. For the works sake they have to oppose a strong draught of natural affection in ministering to a sister in affliction.
