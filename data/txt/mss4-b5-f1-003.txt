Cork the 20th of 10th m. 1785
My Dear Mary
I many times intended writing thee
a few lines, since thou came into this Province, but the
care of a large family often hinderers me of conversing by
the pen, with many of my absent Friends, tho' they
are frequently the companion of my thoughts while
employed about domestic affairs, and a wish sometimes
arises that they may get well on their way through
this World of tryals and temptations, which seem to be
close companions of many; I should like to be with you
at the approaching assembly, if is probable you will
be favoured with the company of some great Ministers
Rebecca Jones is a remarkable Woman in short it is hard
to tell which surpasses - my Husband set out
a few hours ago I wish he or some other of thy Cork friends
could prevail on thee to pay us a visit I should be vastly
pleased to see the here once more do think of coming
how canst thou help coming to see Cousin S. N. after his
hurt I hope Rich:d will bring my Sister Sally home

she has made a long stay with her friends I am anxious
to see her for two reasons one to gratify my own inclincation
of having her with us and another my Dear Mother
has been and at present is in a poor stable of health: she
is about beginning with some medicines which we expect
will relieve her please tell Sister Sally (as I believe
I shant have time to write it being some time past nine
o,clock) that a Mother is better than she was yesterday, I
think she was much better this evening than when I [unclear]saw[/unclear]
her after meeting. also let Sally know I really had not
time to write her so hope she will excuse it [unclear]Freed.[/unclear] her
letter this day and in consequence went to Paul Abbots
about the stuff but was too late as the whole piece was
disposed of but Nancy Abbot intends sending for more
of the same sort.
I expect thou will be well pleased at seeing my Brother
Aby such a pretty Youth, I think I love him almost
like my own Brother —
Thy Poems which thou gave [insertion]Richd[/insertion], have afforded me entertainment
in reading them great enquiries to know where
folks could find the Poem, that Richd Abell, & Jas:

Beale are so distinguished in: I don't know how many
have come to me to see it, I shall be obliged to thee if any
new productions appear when opportunity offers to send
them to me as I take some pains to collect some of thine
— my letter is called for so must conclude my Dear
Molly's affectionate
Eliza Abell
