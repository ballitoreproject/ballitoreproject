Tottenham 11th month 2nd 1701

Dear Cousin

Thy kind proposal gives me an opportunity which I am glad of, of acknowledging how much I am obliged and delighted by the frequent inquiries respecting me, in thy letters. My employment instead of losing any of its charms, grows more and more agreeable, as my knowledge of it increases; and the disadvantages which at first seemed to attend it, diminish in proportion; it is no small addition to the satisfaction I find in it, that my choice meets with the general approbation of those friends, whose Judgement is the most to be relied upon
	I have a great desire to pay a visit to my much respected Relations at Ballitore: perhaps sometime or other I may have that pleasure; if my Mother could muster spirits enough, to undertake the voyage, I should hope to accompany her -- As to my communicating any thing new in the agricultural line, I fear that is out of the question; but I should be very glad to receive instructions in that, as well as Gardening; I confess I know too little of the latter, but my ignorance I think may be attributed, rather to a want of opportunity of learning, than to a want of Inclination: an acquaintance with it, is certainly of no small consequence to the Farmer, without it we should still have wanted, a number of very valuable acquisitions to agriculture, which have been transplanted from the Garden, & are now cultivated with great success; and doubtless judicious experiments may point out other plants, yet confined to Gardens, which if extended to the field, might be very profitable to the Farmer -- I suppose my Mother writes, how much my Father is engagd at the Meetings, likewise their Intentions respecting Bath & other Intelligence, which I must either repeat or confine myself to my own affairs. 		Who is to be my next instructor is not yet concluded; a Friend Shipley of Somersetshire has been proposed, and my Father thinks of taking a ride from Bath to consult with him, & see his Farm  I think, though the Time of my staying at Home should be protracted a little longer, it will be entirely owing to my own Negligence, if it be not advantageously employed; as I have a favorable opportunity of extending my school learning; a French master attends me three times a week, & I endeavour to increase my Knowledge of the Latin by visiting Aunt Forsters school sometimes; I likewise have some expectations of hearing a course of Philosophical Lectures, but that is not yet determined.
	I have now well nigh exhausted my little stock, but before I conclude, must beg thee to present my Love to Cousins, & accept my acknowledgement of thy kind Invitation to Ballitore, which I should be very glad to close in with. I am thy affectionate Cousin
