Tent Lodge May 1st - 1815
Owing to some strange mistake, your friendly
letter after crossing the Channel, return'd again to Dublin! of
course it was very long after it was written, before it reach'd me -
Thank you my good friend for all the kind anxiety you express for
my varied Griefs - It is now nearly fourteen months since I was
bereaved of my darling Bedford; & there were circumstances attending
his loss, which have inflicted wounds never to be heal'd on this side
of the grave- He died at Pendypryn, the abode of his oldest Brother
with whom, I have long ceased to have any intercourse- the last
March also deprived me of my ever-loved Louise, perhaps I ought
not to say [underline]deprived me[/underline], for owing to some designing Persons, she
was led to misconstrue one of my most kind intentions towards her
into a charge that I" was conniving with her Husband to deprive
her of her Child",- these were her words, in answer to my desire to
know, if it would be any satisfaction to [underline]her[/underline], that I shod. offer to
take the Child, on the express condition that she shod. see it whenever
she liked? of course here ended all correspondence between us-

It seems she had undergone an operation for a Cancer, but a mortification
ensued, & she died at an Inn in her way to London- the
moment I heard of her situation I made an offer of attending her, [unclear]but[/unclear]
my letter arrived the day after her death - I have been extremily
hurt at the idea of her leaving this World with so unjust an opinion
of me, - but I have the satisfaction of hearing that nothing could
exceed her pious resignation- I humbly trust she is now happy,
"where the Wicked cease from troubling, & the Weary are at rest."- -
I should apologize for so much Egotism, if you have not Kindly
desired to hear all particulars relating to us- - The Colonel has
quitted the Army, & excepting the complaint in his throat is in
perfect health - Ju:, Tho' always lame, has been better than usual
the last Winter- - My youngest Son, now Sir Charles Felix, is just
setting off for the Netherlands - he acquired credit & Honors during
the Spanish War; & I doubt not will gather fresh Laurels, if it
pleases God to preserve his life- - but a Mother's heart forebodes danger, &
Methinks I see him now- -
Fall'n his crest - his glory gone- -
the opening laurels faded on his brow- -
Silent the trump of his aspiring fame!
No future age shall hear his name,
But darkness spread around his sable gloom,
and deep oblivion rest upon his tomb."

What an interesting account you give of Wm. Robinson! if you pursue
your intention of publishing his letters & poems, pray put down
my name as a Subscriber, & I will pay a Guinea to any person you
direct - I am very glad to hear the School is so flourishing, &
rejoice at the good account you give of all my old Friends, I assure
you I shall never forget the kind attentions I received from them- -
I request you will read a Novel call'd "Discipline" by the authoress
of "Self Control" - be not disgusted with the frivolity of some of the
Characters in the 1st. Vol. (which alas! are [insertion]too [/insertion]true a representation) but
proceed, & I doubt not but you will approve of the whole -
I have been much pleased with Southey's "Roderich the last of
[unclear][/unclear]" but there is too much of Revenge & bloodshed
to suit your meek & peaceable Spirit - i saw Mrs. Keatinge on
Saturday, who desired to be remember'd to you - I left her in great distress
from reading a paragraph in the Newspaper, stating the death
of her Sister's Husband Genl. Gillespie, & her Nephew Capt. Taylor
severely wounded, - in an engagement in India, - this article, without
any previous information, shock'd her to excess! - The Kearneys
are living in Herefordshire. I have very good accounts of
my daughter Allan and her 5 Babes - I am not likely to meet your
friends at Bath, for I grow old & am become almost stationary.

I have a very slight acquaintance with one of the Miss Cummins
Public affairs are too portentous to be named,- & there is no calcula[unclear][/unclear]
What wonderful event will next take place! The Col. & Ja: desire
remembrance to yourself & all our good friends, [unclear][/unclear]
Yrs, very Sincerely, M -
