Dear friend,
	I think I am not very forward in communicating my sentiments after this manner to my friends, & I hope I may very freely take this liberty with thee-- I would be sorry to discourage my younger brethren in religious society from making little, verbal offerings in our meetings of discipline  I do not like to see them always sit as neuter, indifferent & unconcerned hearers of what is going on: I believe if more sat as they ought in those meetings, watching & waiting & feeling after the arising of Good in their own minds, there would be more who would have to utter a few words accompanied with life, & adding solemnly to our solemn assemblies  Here, my dear , is the point  Life is the crown  but words without life, like the letter, kill & wound the spirit life, & so spread death & darkness, instead of life & light. Tis true that in the transactions of discipline, some affairs may be of a civil & external nature  but even in speaking to these affairs (which are, more or less, connected with the cause of Truth) our speaking should be coupled with religious fear, such weight & such humility should be the covering of our spirits, that it would be manifest to the sensible part of the auditory that we had been with Jesus  that we had not been sitting lightly and superficially, listening to what passes in debate, but that while our outward ear was open our inward ear was also open & occupied in hearing what the Spirit said unto the Churches. Thy good sense will suggest to thee that in making these remarks I may probably allude to thy repeated offerings at last Qrly meeting in  The matter of them I do not perfectly remember, but the manner I acknowledge gave me pain  I thought there was not the depth, the simplicity, the self-abasement, which I wish thee to possess, in order to evidence thy own growing in the root of Religion, & the desirable prospect of thy becoming an useful ornament in our poor Society. We want, my dear friends, not fine speakers, & orators, but baptized & baptizing members in our church, & such I wish thee & thy dear wife to be  that in child-like simplicity & unreserved dedication ye may follow on to know the Lord in his humbling operations in your own hearts, & in fitting & qualifying you for true, essential service in his house. ++

I am, dear 
thy truly affectionate friend
Richard Shackleton
