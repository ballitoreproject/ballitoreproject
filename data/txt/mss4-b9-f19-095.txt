My dear E - T Sinton call'd to day to offer
to take my commands to Ballitore I would
have written sooner if I had an opportunity
how is my mother? Deborah did not mention
particulars about her fall but said that
She was much bruised, I wish thou would write
me how she is, I got a top for the pepper [unclear]taster[/unclear]
& left thy commission with F Johnson who had
not just what we wanted but said he would
try for them & might have them in some
days - are the children very troublesome
to you D says thou has Johnny dipp'd every
[unclear][/unclear]ning I'm sure it is very kind of thee
to take so much trouble about him I hope
I shall soon see you I mean to go to you
next week early - how is my father I had
hoped to have seen him with E & D here on
their way to Bangor but was disappointed
tell my aunt S with my love that I went to
Ardee Street to day to S Shaw to ask for money
from Judy Mulroony & was told that Judy
would send some this week so perhaps I
may have it to take with me

I send a [unclear]per[/unclear] of black stockings which I would thank
thee to give to my mother for my aunt Sally &
my mother can let me know if they fit if not
I could get them changed, I will attend to Anty's
commission, I send some thee; Mag's for Eben
Dublin seems very uncomfortable to me I hope
I wont be spoil'd for home by being so indulged
with the country - they are all well
at Glendruid I was there last first day
so thou saw Eliza at the Inn - thou pluck'd
up courage give my love to - Mary & Abby
tell Betsy S to send me a pattern shoe per fist op
that I may get a pair for her & tell her also that
I shall keep her Barns here tile she wishes
Dick Webb to get it give her my love
Why does not Richd come I wish you'd encourage
him, he was expected instead
of me adieu for the presen thy I B
