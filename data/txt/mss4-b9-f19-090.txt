My dear E - the little stockings just fit Mag! Many
thanks for them, she grows slowly I had not time
to write by the [unclear]bearer[/unclear] of the very large turkey & ham
my father sent, we are to have them to day for my
mother who is in town regulating her new house
Selina is here & very poorly, keeping her bed she is
feverish, I hope H Shackleton will excuse my not
excuting her commissions before this but I have been
greatly hurried owing to the irregularity of our house
at present I hope to send them by C Fayle
