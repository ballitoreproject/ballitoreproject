Ballitore: 31/1 month 1761.

Dear friend,

	+++ Hannah Pagan is still with us, her company of great service in helping ^&c.^, & her testimonies in our meetings very close, & I believe for the most part very pertinent [pencil strike through]. There is something in her (in our opinion) very extraordinary & the wisdom of heavenly gift even the revelation to the babes which is hid from the wise & prudent [pencil strike through] +++
	I doubt not but thou hast taken as much sincere pains to get excused from riding in this postchaise,^+^ as many take to get to ride in such a vehicle. And for my part, I am rather in hopes it will tend to make thee more humble than lifted up by such a trifle; for I believe it will contribute to make thee set a closer watch lest the heart, prone ^of itself^ to vanity, & deceitful above all things, should be in any manner elevated thereby. So will the enemy be foiled in all his attempts, & the engines which he employs against the good be turned against himself & his kingdom. And as formerly when he shewed his open malice & got the dear servants of the Most High cast into loathsome dungeons prisons, yet, united together more closely by suffering, they grew together there, & prospered in the precious Truth; so now when he catches so many with the delusive smiles & glitter of this ^deceitful^ world, I trust thou wilt (under the effusion of many favours & blessings inward & outward) shew by thy humble, stead perseverance in the path thy feet have been mercifully turned into, that there is still power sufficient as it is kept to, to give [page number] 20 an overcoming of his wiles. I have lately had in my seasons of retirement a fresh revival of the friendship which has subsisted between us, & I have (I think) in measure seen the noble dedication of thy heart to the noblest cause. My prayers have been afresh poured out on thy behalf, & I hope ^neither one thing nor another,^ neither heights or ^nor^ depths prosperity nor adversity, will weaken thy zeal & fervency in the work whereunto thou hast been called. +++
	thy poor friend

Hannah Pagan was a friend who belonged to the monthly meeting of Carlow, and was an acknowledged minister, esteemed for the innocence & simplicity of her exemplary character. Her bodily frame was feeble, her circumstances were very narrow, but her mind was independent & she endeavoured to be as little burdensome to her friends as possible. She was a pattern of industry, & of cleanliness, for Truth, she said, never led into dirt. [pencil strike through] She bequeathed her bed to a friend in the town where she resided, as a mark of her approbation & encouragement of his hospitality. She died in 1777. In her last lingering illness she expressed herself to this effect. Though I cannot now meet with my dear friends, my spirit is with them in suffering, & in rejoicing.
