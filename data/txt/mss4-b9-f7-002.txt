My dear Elizabeth
We rec'd your kind letter
this morning in answer to Sarah, many
thanks for your offer to send the chaise for
us, tho' we must decline the pleasure
of seeing [insertion]you[/insertion] so soon as we expected. Hear
our Reasons â€” In the first place the Scarletina
has frightened us, so let us know as
soon as ever it disappears in Ballitore
or at least as soon as it no longer shows
itself amongst our acquaintance, In
the [unclear]scent[/unclear] place Sarah is not as well
as she expected, and we wish her to be
a little stronger before she undertakes
the journey, and lastly and most
selfishly, if I went in the morning I
should return on Monday and it would
be much more agreeable to me if they

a least a few days with you. Sarah is
much disappointed at not being
able to go, for she expected a good
deal of health from her visit. However
We hope to see you soon, so mind
a let us know when Scarletina takes
her departure for some more suitable
abode that healthy Ballitore. We have
had no letter from Lydia lately
Sarah sends her love, and remember
me to all those I care about and
believe me yours affectionately
Edwd Barrington
