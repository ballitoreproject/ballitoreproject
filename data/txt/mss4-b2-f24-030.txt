Clonmel 13 of  ^[pencil note] [Jan.]^ 1785

My dear Fathers kind letter I received, & intending to leave home tomorrow to attend our Province meeting in Cork, & having a frank for tomorrows date am just about to leave a few lines (to be forwarded) before I go. Thro mercy we are all at present favoured with health, except my Mother feeble as usual, Molly Dudley was at meeting this day & looked well, her son Jo is confined & very poorly, with rheumatic pains as is supposed, our neighbours generally well, Betty Whitton so recovered as to get out to meeting. We have late intelligence also from Mahitable Jenkins that she is bravely, & the pock drying on her. I am concerned to hear my sisters Childs leg is not well yet, when does Debby expect to lie in? our [sic] little Elizabeth goes alone, & is pleasant company, Sally is beginning to go to School, so that I find myself less encumbered than some time ago, I dont think my Maid Debby alters for the worse, I expect she will do, or that I shall do with her, she is very easy in temper, & diligent in her business, sometimes I think her too easy, but this apprehension I partly set down to my own account, being naturally quick myself, & I consider every person cannot be so, & that by expecting every one to keep pace with my quickness of thought, & insisting on it, I should only confuse & puzzle them & do myself no good. therefore [sic] taking her in her own way, & getting the best she has out of her, she may answer.
	I am concerned to hear poor Anna Taverner continues so ill, she is along [sic] time lingering under her afflictions, I pity the family also where she is, it must be attended with difficulty in a family, I hope poor Cousin Jonathan is well paid for it, this ^remark^ between ourselves, for I have been thinking, otherwise he could not afford it, having a large family of his own; & their time must be much engrossed ^ by her^, I sincerely wish it may be of permanent profit to his children, & that they may be blessed by the bountiful hand of kind Providence with both temporal & spiritual supplies: that if she be placed there by his ordering, who commanded the Widow Woman to sustain & succour the Prophet Elijah, that on their little provision the same blessing may ^also^ descend.
	My Husband joins me in duty & dear love to you as due.	And am thy affectionate Margaret Grubb
