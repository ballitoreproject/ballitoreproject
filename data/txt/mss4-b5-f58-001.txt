Waterford 23d, 10th Month 1779
Dear Mary
as I am about to Inclose a letter to Thy Father
in a cover directed To Thee, it just Occurd To give Thee a line
expressive of a Wish which arose whilst I was looking
at the cover, and that is, That from May like many
of old, early in Life, make Choise of, and hold Fast,
The Good Part, That Part which through Life
will be the best Portion, and in Death the only
valuable Inheritance, The Sacrifice of the youth full
mind fails not of finding Acceptance with the Taker
of Mercys, He will make Such his own Dear Children;
will love Them, and make them lovely; Bless them
with His Choicest Blessings; he with them through
life; and Receive them into glory hereafter: There
are Great things in Prospect, lift up then thee
Eyelids of thy youth full mind to behold them;
Keep them in view; & suffer not any lying, Vanity
To divert thy Attention from Them,
Thy Very afft. friend
Mrs. Greer
