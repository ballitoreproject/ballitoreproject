Seventhday-Night 9 mo.... 30th.. 1780 I laid me down to rest, and dropped into a
natural Sleep; after some time I dreamed and supposed myself to be in a place that
somewhat resembled an underground Kitchen; where was a large Dog, the colour of
which was inclined to fair, and not unlike that with which Sheep is generally Cloathed:
I couldn't conceive how he got in, but in an uncommon [insertion]manner[/insertion] strove to get into my favour, by
fawning on me, and other ways which that Species of Beasts frequently practice: notwithstanding
those great shews of kindness I found myself very uneasy at staying with
him in one place, and endeavoured to get free, by getting him outside the door, and
shutting it then on myself; but this didn't prove effectual, for he remained exactly
where I placed him (without) and thereby had me confined within: in this
situation I remained but a short time, when I was instructed to get him in my place
(shut up) and then I shou'd be inlarged and set at liberty: which I very easily
effected, was greatly pleased, and enjoyed much satisfaction.
When I woke this matter appeared to me quite trivial, yet I can't say but I
thought on it different times, but not with the least apprehension of there being any
thing more in it than a common dream, 'till this Evening (of the next day) in
Meeting it was very strikingly revived, and a Voice as it were ran through me in a
very solemn, awfull manner; saying to this import, 'the Dog which thou sawest
was Satan: the Love &c. he shewed for thee was, or may be likened unto his Gilded-
Baits, by which he is endeavouring to allure thee, and stop thee in thy Way, the
Way that's cast up for thee: that which made thee uneasy with his Company, and
stimulated thee to avoid him, was the Light of Christ in thy Conscience, which
as thou takes heed unto, 'twill manifest him to thee in all his appearances,
formings, and transformings: and if thou abides in it, and suffers thyself to
be guided by it, thou shalt in time be enabled to bruise his Head, and shut
him up as it were in that place; then shalt thou be inlarged, and thy
Soul set at liberty.' -
