3rd Saturday, I did not spend it
very pleasantly. It was a wet
morning and just as we were
walking in the colonnade Mr Baird
joined us for a moment and told
me a party of ladies were going
to try the Turkish bath, so thinking
I might as well try what they were
like I settled [unclear]on joining[/unclear] one of the
company.
