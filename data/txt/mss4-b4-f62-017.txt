[underline]I think[/underline] I have no wish to differ in sentiment from those I most
love for the sake of differing, - nor do I desire to join with any
for the sake of making myself acceptable to them; - I wish to get
to a little [underline]right feeling[/underline], & in [underline]this feeling[/underline] to act, or not to act.
If I know my own heart, I am willing to acknowledge the right
thing as well as I am capable of judging in [underline]all[/underline], old or new light,
[insertion]or[/insertion] under whatever [insertion]other[/insertion] name called by men; & on the contrary renounce
what I apprehend wrong in [underline]any[/underline] or all of them. But, my dearly
loved sister Margt., do not be grieved at [underline]my[/underline] not endeavouring
to keep up a preparative meeting here, for circumstanced
as I am (both within & without) I cannot conceive it right for
[underline]me[/underline] to make this exertion for the gratifying of those who wou'd
not chuse to take any trouble themselves, tho' they can speak
out of meetings, & who seem to have a life in [underline]talking[/underline] of
the times that [underline]are[/underline], & the good times that [underline]were[/underline]. I could
have spoken freely to thee, but that I think there is a disposition
prevalent of not giving a hearing: - would it not be
fair to give [underline]every one[/underline] a hearing? & then if right judgement be
given, give it in love.
