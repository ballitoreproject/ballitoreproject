Clonmel 20/2 month 1784

My dear Fathers acceptable letter I received, before W: Matthews left us; your love was kindly received by him & he desired his in return, & to tell Sally he had got two Flannel night caps, one as red as a Monkeys head, & yet was not cured of the tooth ^ache^, he got a little stump taken away here, yet left us complaining of his jaw, he also complained one morning of the head ache; we seemed more & more attached & united, we to him & he to us, & took a solemn leave, with tears of sorrow fearing we should see his face no more, he spoke a few words, after a pause of silence, & expressed his nearness to us, (my Husband, Becky & I present) wishing our stability to walk in the path discovered to be our duty to tread, believing the Lord would yet have a people in this Land, & that this part of his footstool would yet become glorious: it was fifth day after meeting he left us, we had an instructive meeting that day; our dear friend was engaged on the conversation that passed between our Saviour & Peter: first introduced with a query to Peter lovest thou me? & his injunction to feed his Lambs & feed his sheep, but particularly this command follow thou me but Peter was curious to know what was required for the beloved Disciple, who seemed to be a peculiar favourite with his Master, & queried What shall this Man do, but his Lord replied What is that to thee, follow thou me & therefore he exhorted us not to be looking out to the most eminently favoured for example, but simply follow the guidance of Truth in the way of its requirings, so should we reap a crop of Peace & joy even ^in^ this Life, (that hundred fold which is promised by him who never deceived,) & ^in^ that which is to come Life everlasting. I wish all the favours renewed to us from season to season may not encrease our guilt, but answer the end intended to arouse us to an impartial view of our standings, & what we are building upon, for many lively testimonies have been born this meeting, & I believe in the authority of Truth, these valient [sic] Women from America seem to be sharp-threshing instruments, they have sounded ^an^ alarm, threatened heavy judgments if we will not otherwise be awakened, & humble ourselves before him who sees the secret intent & bent of our hearts, however plausible our appearance may be in the sight of Man; for my part I felt my blood chilled, & my heart seemed afrighted: but my Brother can tell you, except that in the Womens meeting which was especially close & searching; though they seemed to speak encouragingly to a little remnant who seemed to be preserved alive, but Rebecca said there seemed scarce living enough to bear the dead. I have run on, as it occurred to my remembrance, knowing thou likes unreserve, & art continually encouraging me to it. Now to answer thy queries. I should have said our dear friend W: Matthews left this for Limerick accompanied by my Uncle Benjamin (& Thomas Taverner, the latter waited for them after our Province meeting,) in order to visit families there, the Women friends gone to Cork, by way of Rehill or Tincurry, William & my Brother slept in the room thou lodged in here, in the opposit [sic] room Joseph Garrat & his wife, little Betty Pike with sister Becky, & our beloved James Abell in our narrow long room, between ours [sic] & the Nursery, these were our lodges [sic], & so they were stowed, we keeping possession of our own apartment: dear afflicted Molly Watson was at this meeting, & lodged ^at^ Anner mills, I felt my mind full of love to her in her low distressed state, I hope she experienced comfort here, as such a mournful, tryed [sic] spirit seemed to be spoke comfortably to: poor Molly Dudley remains confined with illness, was never out at meeting since thou were here, I saw her to day, & she was very poorly, three of her children had got some cold, particularly Mary was very ill, Joseph Wood has buried a little Girl this week with an inflammation (I think) on her lungs, & his wife is lying in of another daughter, sister Sally John gets to meeting & I hear her children thrive well. Molly Davis still in Cork, suppose thou heard she has appeared in a publick testimony in that City.
	It it time for me to say I was concerned to hear of the accident that befel [sic] thee, I hope thou wilt not venture thyself again on that old Beast, poor John Haughton, it was a mercy he escaped so well also, i hope you are both bravely ere now. I am obliged to thee for thy account of poor Tom Eyre, I should like to see him, poor Sam, fine creature! If thou sees William Matthews at Mountrath please to give my Husbands & my dear love to him, also to J: & E: Pike if there.
Having filled my paper I must make an end, with my Mothers & Beckys dear love to you, in which they are joined by my Husband & your dutiful & affectionate daughter MGrubb
