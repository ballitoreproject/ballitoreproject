My dear Elizth
I recd thy little letter by M Wright & was
sorry to find that Eben had been worse, I hope
he shall have a better account tomorrow.
was my mother relieved by the blister ? I long
to hear particulars of the Invalids - J Williams
beg'd that I would forward the enclosed, I saw
D Johnson this eve for the first time since I return ' d
she was in the country when I call'd first
I suppose Jane is about going to John, -
either Deb : or thou desired me to buy a [unclear]cheving[/unclear]
which I rend with the plates
did thou ever find out who got the
churn o, - I forgot to send Betsy her little bottle
of fennell water it was on the chimney piece
in our room I would be much obliged to her
to send it to her & to send me the spit
by whoever brings the potatoes, excuse this
trouble I know thou art greatly hurr'ed
