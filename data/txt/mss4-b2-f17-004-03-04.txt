From the same to the same

Ballitore, 28/9 month: 1790

Beloved friend,
Our agreeable cousin John Grubb giving us a call here on his way to Clonmel, I had a mind to send thee a line by him  not that I knew of any thing I had to send deserving thy acceptance  but I wanted to tell let thee know that I remember thee  that thy welfare is dear to me  that when I hear of thy being afflicted in body or mind, I am troubled - & when I am informed of thy getting loose from thy chains, & being vindicated into a land of liberty & enlargement, & light & life, I rejoice in thy account. I know not how it has come to pass that my spirit thus dwells in sympathy & unison with thee  only that we are told that this wind, (this current of divine air) bloweth where it listeth, but we cannot tell whence it cometh, nor whither it goeth  so is that which is born of the spirit. And I humbly trust our religious fellowship is a birth of that kind. I was glad to hear by the bearer that he had intelligence this morning in Dublin of thy being better  Mayest thou be bettered by every one of these afflictive dispensations, & come out of them all still more refined, as pure gold ^out^ of the furnace, new, solid, weighty, substantial, bright, prepared for the glorious impression of the image & superscription of the great King! I understand ^too^ our dear Peggy has had a trying time of indisposition  I hope she ^too^ has recruited, & trust He who comforteth those that are cast down will comfort you by the coming of Titus  for we mean to let our Sally go to Clonmel  And indeed (to confess a weakness) I feel it something like the rending of the heart-strings to let that dear child go from me. Her example exceedingly great & deep-rooted humility, simplicity & nothingness of self preach loudly & constantly to us - her voice is not often heard in our assemblies, but to me it always appears to be the sound of the Gospel  We have also dear, sweet Anna Taverner among us on a visit to her friend Hannah Haughton: methinks they are like Mary & Elizabeth saluting one another: they are so sweet, so humble, & so impregnated with good. Anna increases fast (in my judgment) in lustre & beauty, in the exercise of her precious gift. + + + + How is our beloved E.P. in body & mind? I cannot bear to have her always sunk  make her lift up her head, & shew her the good land that is beyond Jordan, that goodly mountain & Lebanon. Tell me good tidings of ^about^ her & thyself. + + + Farewell, my beloved friend, - my wife loves thee perhaps almost as well much as I do  my children & Anna Taverner bear thee true affliction. Remember me affectionately to thy husband  my good wishes attend thy little one.
I am (I trust) thy faithful friend
Richard Shackleton
