The following is the purport of a Prophetic declaration,
delivered by Zacheriah Dicks, from North America, at a
Meeting held at Randels Mills, Co. Wexford 24th 4 mo 1786
Towards the conclusion of a living testimony he said,
he hoped ever to be very cautious how he spoke to his friends, in
a prophetick manner, as he was sensible of the weight of such an
undertaking, but he believed it his duty at that time, to declare
unto us, his having seen in the pure Vision of [underline]Light[/underline] which never
yet deceived him, that the Almighty, for the many abominations
committed in this little Island, had drawn the sword
which would never be sheathed, till the inhabitants thereof [deletion]wou'd[/deletion]
wou'd learn righteousness.
That the potsherds of the earth shoud be made to dash
each other in pieces and the people of this nation hur[insertion]d[/insertion]led hither,
& thither, because they had provoked the Lord to anger, who had
long waited over them in mercy; & because the[deletion]y[/deletion] professors of the
blessed truth, were disobedient unto the manifestations of his saving
light, in themselves, many of whom instead of standing up
for him in their generations, & approving themselves followers of
Jesus; had embraced the world & the things of it, wandering on
the barren mountains of an outside & empty profession: On these
professors if they were not timely concerned, to make grateful returns
for the many privileges they had every way received, a day of
for the many priviliges they had every way received, a day of
scattering wou'd shortly be permitted to come. That these who in
the approaching calamities, wou'd place their dependance on the
arm of flesh, & fly thereto for safety, should be disappointed; but
that

that such as would place their entire dependance on the powerful
arm of the Almighty, should be preserved as in the hollow
of his hand. For as the mountains are round about Jerusalem,
so will the arm of the Lord be around his people. He said he was
a witness lately, of the horrors of war in his own Country, which
was often attended with confused [insertion]noise[/insertion] & garments roll'd in blood, when
those professors of the peaceable truth, who fled for protection to this
party, or to the other party, were disappointed, but that friends
(generally) being enabled to stand their ground in faithfulness, were
wonderfully preserved. He therefore thought it required of him thus
to warn us, to prepare against a trying time similar thereto, that
was soon to overtake us, which would prove all our foundations;
& cautioned us not to suffer the impressions we might have received,
by what he had then delivered in our hearing, to be hurt
or made of none effect, by too freely talking of, or communicating
it to others, but endeavour to profit thereby.

The substance of a Dream & Prophecy as near as cou'd be
recollected, delivered by George Dillwin at a publick meeting in Dublin,
1785 which dream he had, some time before the American War.
My house being situated on or near the banks of a river, the
water thereof swelled so high I thought, as to overflow it's banks, and
continued to rise till it came to the threshold of the door, & seemed to
rage with great violence, carrying off many loose things about the house;
some of which appeared valuable & thinking it a pity, to see so many
things of seeming value, going with the flood, I thought I put forth my
hand to keep them, by which I much endang'red my being taken also;
but withdrawing myself into the house, I thought I had a sense given me,
that my business was to be still & keep within doors, & that nothing that
was necessary wou'd be taken; which dream he mentioned had afterwards
when the troubles began, afforded him much instruction, to
keep himself loose from the world: and he had to believe a similar dispensation
would shortly overtake this nation, of Ireland; & that the
time was approaching, when many & some present, who tho' they professed,
& but lightly esteemed truth, wou'd be tried thereby, even the
name of a Quaker wou'd be precious.
He exhorted friends to disentangle themselves, & keep separate
from the world; and its' spirit, and have their minds stayed upon the
Almighty; whose presence alone would be their only support in
such a trying time, the approach of which to this Nation, he seemed
to have so clear a prospect of, that he desired it might be noted
down, and to remember, it was a friend from America told it them, &
if it came not to pass, they might call him a false Prophet -
