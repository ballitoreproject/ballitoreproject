Saturday. Papa and Mama went to
town by the eleven tram bringing Dick
with them. They came out by
the 1/46 6 and were disappointed at not
finding Aunt Liddy and Anne Curry
at the station as they had previously
arranged to come out. However at
about 9 1/2 2 a knock came to the door
and who should it be but Aunt L, Uncle
James, and Anne Curry. They had
been late for the other train, and thinking
it as better late than never came by
it was better late than never came by
the next.
PSB and SB went to meeting; called
21
at Home lodge on their return and at the
Shanganagh station for Charlie who came out
by the one train. Our visitors
by the one train. Our visiters
could not stay a second night so -
went in by the 8 train.
