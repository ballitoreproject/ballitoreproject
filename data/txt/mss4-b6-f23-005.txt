It is it is, my friend, the well-known face
Not yet despoiled by Time of nature grace,
I gaze, & gushing tears bedim my eyes,
Back through twice sixteen years while memory flies.
Recalling youth's gay season, & those friends
Whose dear idea with that season blends.
What though 'tis but a semblance that I view,
'Tis a substantial proof of Friendship true;
A proof that Time not Absence can control
The vivid feelings of the generous soul,
A proof that their sweet influence can descend:
Lo! the kind daughter [deletion]for[/deletion] [insertion]to[/insertion] her father's friend.
Presents the valued gift, those features traced,
Prompted by love, by genius, & by taste.
And do I now behold the looks again,
Long severed by the vast Atlantick main
Of him who[deletion]se step has pressed[/deletion] [insertion]gaily trod[/insertion] my native plain,
The graceful youth on whose soft cheek displayed,
The rival roses equal empire swayed;
Whose eyes intelligent bespoke a mind
Sincere & ardent, gentle & refined?
Though Spring's fair morn is fled, the autumnal day
Sheds o'er that brow its mild, benignant ray.
Accomplished fair, upon thy gentle [insertion]youthful[/insertion] head
Already Heaven hath many blessings shed;
May these continue still to know increase,
And sweet Sophia's days roll on in peace,
Accept my thanks; mayest thou, in life's decline
The pleasure prove which thou hast given to mine.
