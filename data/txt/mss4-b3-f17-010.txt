Norwich 16th 2nd month 1788


My dear Friend
        I received thy very kind letter at Youngs Bury, my stay at that peaceful habitation having been rather longer this time than heretofore. I returned here with my beloved Ward about three weeks ago, and so far as the approbation of her Parents and near kindred goes I have reason to be fully gratified. I endeavour to do the best I can for her, but I feel almost daily that I am unequal to so important a task, and if there were a probability of its being performed better by anyone that her friends would be likely to procure, I think I should relinquish it - her natural disposition being so amiable & her propensities leaning so much on the side of benevolence and univer [?] charity leaves me little to correct in her, but even those dispositions sometimes call for prudent, and well timed counsel and discrimination, that in her readiness to applaud the actions of others, and in the fertility of her mind in producing excuses for their errors, she may not lose the distinction between good and evil, and imitate those who are not worthy of itJohn Gurneys Wife has parted with her accomplished Governess and is very desirous of having the assistance of one of our Society in the education of her numerous family hitherto they have been unsuccessful in their enquiries, and have not been able to procure one
        I was much obliged to thee for communicating the news of my dear Debby Chandlees safety, and have since been concerned to hear of hers, as well as my Cousin Peggys loss - I have a letter from my Sister Grubb by which I find that she is very much affected by her late accident, I hope the effects of it are not so formidable as she seems to apprehend, our poor Betsy too, was much indisposed and that, together with the indisposition of our dear and valuable Aunt Pike contributed to depress them and perhaps turn the darkside of every prospect to view.
        Thy account of your general, religious visit, was truly acceptable to me - I love thy good wishes for us and hope to keep the good advice annexed to them in my rem^em^brance and profit by it as a seasonable watch-word
        The former altercation with all its disagreeable consequences is again revived in this meeting J. Roper will speak and from the Gallery too, notwithstanding all that has been done to prevent him. John Bousell too, is at variance with the Monthly Meeting, has appealed to the Quarterly Meeting and talks of appealing to the Yearly Meeting - these dissentions [sic] are truly sorrowful
        Sam Hoare is likely to be married to Hannah [obscured by seal] the eldest daughter of Henry Sterry at whose house I think we have been together - It promises to be an agreeable union
        Those valuable friends Benjamin Evans and his wife are tried with heavy afflictions their daughter Rachel (a sweet girl) is so low as almost, if not quite, to amount to Insanity - 
        Be so kind as to assure thy Wife and all thy Children of my very sincere affection - Be assured of it thyself and that I think myself much indebted to thee for this renewal of our correspondance [sic]Farewell my dear Friend                Hannah Pim
