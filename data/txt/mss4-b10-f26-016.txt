Dresden March 29th 1847
My dearest Mother,
It was with great pleasure indeed we received
your letters yesterday I was longing very much to hear of you
all and I am rejoiced to find that you all are getting on pretty
well at home so far I trust it will continue to be the case whilst
we are away & long long afterwards too - I would wish to have better
accounts of poor Dickey I fear he is not careful enough of himself
he ought to be careful not to take too much nourishment but remember
there is nearly one fourth of the body [underline]less[/underline] to use up what he take
than before the operation--[deletion]This[/deletion] It is very common for inflamatory
diseases to follow such an operation on that account or [unclear][/unclear]
there is a greater tendency to Inflamation. I hope Emy's cough
is better - I need ask no questions as I cannot I suppose get
any letter from you written after you receive this
I enclose all the letters to you that you [insertion]& Elizth[/insertion] may read
them [insertion]first[/insertion]& then if the persons are with you it is a thing of
course if not you can send them by post & I will pay
the postage when I see you - I must conclude as I shall
lose a days post if not sent off soon - I believe Bessie
must be married on [underline]Easter Monday[/underline] as the Ambassador
is going away from this for some weeks & she could [insertion]not[/insertion] wait
his return at least Thos. could not - with dearest love
to R, E, & F. Manliff & Aunt Fayle & all [deletion][/deletion] of the dear ones
in which I am joined by Thos. I am my dear Mother your affectionate
daughter E Henry
please let Arthur get his note as soon as possible
after you receive this
