Ballitore 4 mo 14th 1826
My dear Sarah
I received thy message
about the servant, also thy note, both
of which I have attended to, Maria
Tete was here to-day, she says that
girl is not very stout, and hardly
thinks she would answer for thorough
servant , or any place she would have
a great deal to do, but if for children's
maid or such as that, would answer very
well, she spoke of her having many good
qualities, but as she is delicate I think
it would only teaze thee to have any
thing to do with her - would thou like
me to look out for another for thee. -

There does not appear to be much difference
in thy dear Mother's health since thou
wert here, the Doctor had a blister put
on one of her thigh's yesterday which has
not been dressed yet, and is at present giving
her a good deal of uneasiness, her
breathing is not worse, but she is very low
and languid at times, her limbs are very
much swelled, but I hope the blisters may
reduce them, she rests tolerably some nights,
others very restless and uneasy - I wish my
dear Sarah I could give thee a more flattering
account, and hope I may be able to do so after
a bit, fine weather has often a wonderful
effect on invalid's, I would not have thee
be too much cast down. - Mary
was very poorly most of last week with a cold
but is now a good deal better, the Doctor wd
have bled her but could not find a vein -

We got over the presentation better than I expected,
the wedding is fast approaching, I
wish it was over. - I suppose thou hears
daily of the good accounts of Lydia, she is
getting on rapidly - [unclear]Eben[/unclear] too finely - My aunt
Jane quite stout, she was down here to-day.
Thy Aunt Sally is in Goshen, she and
Mary join me in love, - give a kiss
for me to each of the little ones, two to
my own wee Willie.
I am thy affectionate friend
Abby Wright.

For Sarah.
