My dear Grandfather,

I was favoured with thy second very kind letter, which gave me great pleasure. My Sister Eliza is a little better in health, but there is a speck on the sight of one of her eyes, which my Mother fears is a Pearl. I hope Nanny is better. I am glad of my cousin Richards going on so merrily with the Latin grammar. I am also going on with both Latin & French & Ciphering. My Grandmother is very weakly, & rests very badly at Night. My little Cousin Joseph Grubb has got the small-pox, we are in hopes that it will turn out pretty well, tho the pock is bad. I am my dear Grandfather thy dutiful Grandson Abraham Grubb.
