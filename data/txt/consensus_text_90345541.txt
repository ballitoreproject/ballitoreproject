stopped in a friendly manner to
[deletion]talk[/deletion] exchange a few words about
the walks &c &c and asked us had
we been to see the Turkish house
not far distant and directed us to
it - It belongs to a Mr Urquahart -
who has come over from Turkey lately
and carried many of his fashions
with him -. Before he built this
little mansion which is a [unclear][/unclear] model
of a Turkish one, he lived in a tent
quite near this and from what
I have learned from Peggie our
maid, must be rather unique in
his way - On our return
Ned was summonsed by the
bath boy and away he went to
get his first bath -
He seemed quite to like it and
felt pleasant after it, so may be
after all the water treatment may
benefit him more than we expect.
Everybody seemed inclined to be [unclear][/unclear]
Every body seems inclined to be [unclear][/unclear]
