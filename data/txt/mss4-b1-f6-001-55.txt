Sir -
I was yesterday favoured with your kind Letter,
which I shewed to Tom who is now in Dublin, & I can truly
say, we are really sensible of the Civilities we have already
experienc'd from you & your family, & also for
your present friendly invitation; Tom intimates his
intention of going to see you shortly, & I shall be as
desirous of doing myself that pleasure, subsequent
to my having somewhat satisfactory to say relative to
your demand, an opportunity I eagerly wish for.
Tom is at present in good Health, the last
account I had of Sam: was by letter dated Madras
April 1781, he was then a Lieutenant on Board the
Superbe-Man of War, & by a subsequent Enquiry at
the Navy-Office, London, I heard he commanded a
party at the taking of Trincomale; Tom joins me
in most respectfull complts: to you & Mrs. Shackleton,
Mr. & Mrs. A: Shackleton, [insertion]Mr. &[/insertion] Mrs. Grubb, Mr. & Mrs.
Chandlee,
