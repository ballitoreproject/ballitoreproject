Dear John,

++++ It gives us considerable concern that our dear Debby continues so weakly. We are all in the hands of an All-powerful & All-wise Being, who knows what is best for us, who creates good & creates evil, & who has promised that all things, evil as well as good (adversity as well as prosperity) shall work together for good to those who love & fear Him. If thy dear wife & self make the right use of this bodily weakness, laid upon her, I hope it will conduce to your good, in shewing you the uncertainty of all worldly enjoyments, and what poor, weak creatures we are. This will cause true humility & an earnest seeking after the best help, and be as ballast to the mind too apt to be lifted up above the proper standard. And as there is a thorough resignation wrought in the creature, when it pleases infinite Wisdom & Goodness, He can lighten or remove, (as of old) all manner of sickness, & all manner of disease, both of body & mind among his people. ++++++
	I should be pleased to hear how thy father & thou succeeded in the blessed office of Peace-making. You are really to be pitied in [page number] 42 that country, perhaps more than we are here. The Youth among you had need to be diligent in the great school (the school of Christ) that partly by theory, partly & jointly by practice, ye may learn how to act in the house of the Lord. Thou hast been favoured beyond most (I think) there in the precept & example of such a father & grandfather: & for this great favour, joined to that of a good understanding, & (I believe) a gracious visitation from the Great First Cause, thou art doubtless accountable, as for so many talents. +++++
	thy truly affectionate friend & kinsman
		Richard Shackleton
