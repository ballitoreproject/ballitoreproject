Carlsruhe 9th Aug
1854
My dearest Mama
I suppose you are
all wondering why we dont write
we thought we might as well wait till
we came [underline]here[/underline], besides since we left
London we [deletion][/deletion] did not stay long enough
in any place to write - I hope our
last went safe - posted the day we
left London - the 5th inst -
we left London at 9 oC AM rather
a rough passage most of those on
board were sick I was not & was
afraid I wd have been so as I was
not well the night before - the
sea air did me good had a good
appetite for my dinner - as I [deletion]has[/deletion] eat
scarcely any breakfast - going on
board we met Gabe Fisher so
we had his company - a pleasanter
man than I thought he was -
we did not get to Ostend till 10 PM
left it the next morning at 7-15 by
Express train to Colo[deletion]n[/deletion]gne - where
our luggage was searched - & then
by rail to Bonn where we
slept - nothing very particular
this far on our journey -

The weather cleared up & it was
delightful to see the sun -
on the 7th we left Bonn [insertion]at 6-45 am[/insertion] by steamer
[underline]up[/underline] the Rhine - we were very
fortunate in the weather & [underline]I[/underline]
was delighted with that sail
The scenery around was beautiful
We breakfasted on the deck
had [deletion]the[/deletion] a table to ourselves &
We got out at Castel this side of Mayence
were just in time for the 6 oC PM
Train for Frankfort - we parted
with G Fisher on leaving the Steamer
he is on a walking loop through
Switzerland - We got to Frankfort
a little after 7 oC - remained there
only one night - It is a very
picturesque town - we went to
Bethmann's Museum where we
saw Ariadne also to the Picture
Gallery - left it yesterday [insertion]the 8th[/insertion] at
one oC by railway for Heidelburg
with wh I have been more
delighted than any place I have
been in yet - not with the town
but the country around it is
very prettily situated & exceedingly
picturesque - it is partly between

two hills wh are planted all o[unclear]ver[/unclear]
with trees - a carriage [insertion]road[/insertion] over one
of them to a castle in ruins
wh belonged to one of the
former princes - a splendid
view from it of the town the
river & the country around -
I am not entering into particulars
of every thing I wish to leave
something to tell on my return
home - besides as yet we have
scarcely seen any thing - travelling
as fast as we can the whole
way - yesterday was the only
idle day with regard to that -
the early part of wh we spent in
Frankfort the latter in Heidelburg
we left the latter today at
11 oC AM got here 4. [deletion]30[/deletion] PM -
Mrs Crawford not come yet -
neither has thy letter nor
any word from Dr Henry -
Weather [deletion]we[/deletion] very fine and very
hot - what will it be when

we get to Switzerland? -
This is a quiet town in comparison to
others Strait Streets broader than those
of Frankfort not a all picturesque
a flat country - We stay [deletion]t[/deletion]here two
or three days to see or hear what
Dr H will do - I suppose Mrs
Crawford will come either this
evening or tomorrow morning -
I do not wonder at the poor here
being better off than those of
Ireland - the whole secret is
that they are not idle besides
they have not as much as one
square yard of waste ground -
The hills along the Rhine are planted
to the top of various things [deletion]but[/deletion] mostly
[deletion][/deletion] vines -
10th Aug - Yesterday evening when
we were walking [deletion][/deletion] through
the streets we met Mrs Crawford
to our great astonishment - she has
been here this week back waiting
for us - by some mistake Uncle did
not get her letter, altogether it was a
queer piece of business - the worst is
we are not in the same Hotel -
