Glendruid 5th mo 21st 1833
I am just after receiving thy welcome letter my
dear Eliza, I expected one last night but was disappointed,
I read it aloud, Frank and I had just come in from
walking so he had the advantage of it and heard what
thou said respecting him, he has been out here now
these some days back, and desires me to say, that he
intends going in to morrow as he wants to let Sally
out to Elizth for a few days and he has business to
do in town himself he there fore could not leave
home again for a fortnight at least, and that at
that time perhaps he might be able to go for thee
he intends to write thee a fuller account himself
than I can give thee in a day or two. my Mother
 says if thou would like to wait for him that thou
might do so [insertion]if[/insertion] thou wished it, and by no means to
think of coming by thyself she would send Arthur
for thee if there was no other opportunity, it seems
a pity for thee not to wait for Frank for I think
you would both enjoy meeting in Ballitore, -
We still continue [underline]well[/underline] here, and as far as I know
about Dublin they are pretty well there too. the Junells
have not yet come out nor I dont know when
they will. I believe in my last letter I mentioned
Richard's having gone to town, he came second day

evening, he seems to enjoy himself greatly out here
indeed they are very snug in the cottage. I will go
back a little and tell thee what we have been doing
Frank & I rode over to Larchfield to see how Jane was
it was on fifth day last, she seemed very middling, she
was up but looks badly and is in bad spirits, Patty
was not there she having gone to Thomas', who I suppose
thou knows has got a daughter. as this is a year for
fine names thou wilt not be surprised to hear of her's
being [underline]Rhoda[/underline], and little [underline]Rigg' John Sam[/underline]. the houses
are not set yet, scarcely any one at all going out to
look at them and very few of the places set in the neighbourhood,
it would be a great ease to their minds if they
were set. 6th day my Mother went to town. 7th day was
a beautiful day, Frank & Elizth dined here, we got tea
early & F & I went out to ride. first day - F and I
Elizth Manliff & I went to meeting. coming home we
overtook Lucy & Frederic walking a little at this side
& Pim's gate so Maurice got down Manliff took
his seat, and the five of us squeezed into the car and
drove home, we did not expect to see Lucy at all so
it was a very agreeable surprize, Frank & L dined with
us. Emy is as fond of them as ever, indeed Frank wonders
how she remembers him she says nothing yet but is
much stouter on her feet and likes being in the cottage.
better than the big house, when we ask her where Aunt
Eliza is she looks about & says "[underline]gone[/underline]" we all drank tea
with Elizabeth including Emmy her first visit of that

kind. Frank & Lucy & Fred- went in to town, we partly expected
Richard out but he did not come, I staid with
E and slept in Frank's bed, the first time I ever staid a
night in that house. I was home in the morning to
get breakfast - 2nd day Manliff went to town to day, he brought
Richard out with him in the gig which is broke again
and Manliff says he wont be bothered mending it any more
R & E came down to us after tea and sat a bit, Frank
came too having just arrived from town, having been
lucky in getting nearly the whole way on a car, they
staid with us to sup on asparagus. - I have now got
up to today and have told thee all our in's & out's as
well as I can recollect. Richd. & Elzth. Frank & Manliff took
a jaunt to see Moss' Factory. Joshua & Sally
Jacob came out and took tea with us this
evening & brought their son Saml. he semed
quite at home here. they went in almost
immediately after tea. F.W. went to Isaac
Gathchells I have not heard how he has been since, this
beautiful weather I hope will do him good, he seemed
very middling when he left this, I heard he went off
in good spirits & brought his fishing rod with him as
if he was determined to enjoy himself, I am sure I hope
he may. every one in the house is in bed but myself
and it is nearly time for me to lay by for tonight perhaps
I may finish it in the morning. I wished [insertion]to[/insertion] have
a little ready to send in tom[deletion]m[/deletion]orrow if there is an opportunity
as it is drawing near the time for writing &
I suppose thou wilt be expecting it. I am glad to hear that
Cousin Betsy has got stout again, it is dismal to have so many
of them laid up at Henry's. please give my love to Cousin B & Elizth

I did not tell thee how much in love Frank & Elizth are
with George Pim's dont be alarmed it is not himself but his
place that they like so well, E calls it her domain &
says it there she will bring her visitors to walk, Frank
is quite delighted with it and wonders we dont oftener
go there, he has been there twice already. farewell till morning.
4th day morning I just sit down before going to meeting
to finish this, that I may leave it ready to go by Richard
when he is going today perhaps he would not go till
evening and then thou wilt not get this for another
day, This is another delightful day I expect to hear
from thee soon to say how thou hast fixed about
coming home. my Mother sends her dear love in which

I join and believe me thy affecte. Sister Selina
