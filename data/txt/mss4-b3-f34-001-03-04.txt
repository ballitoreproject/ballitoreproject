        Indeed, my dear Friend, I deem myself very unworthy of thy so great regard & attention  it is too much  but a beneficent Creator has dealt bountifully with me in many respects, & particularly in inclining the minds of many of his favourites towards me  The consideration operates upon me, I own, as I would wish: it humbles me: & that which humbles delights me  I greatly rejoice in being brought low: I love the littleness: it is a safe state  I sih it also for my beloved friends: that what they are they may be by the Grace of God: a very little purse gold is preferable to a great deal of baser metal  My pen, like my tongue, is apt to run when conversing with thee. ^I often, if not always, feel an uncommon openness of communication with thee.^ I bear about me a longing desire to have thee be something, I know not what, but that which the Lord Almighty would have thee to be. And surely He would have thee to be his humble, devoted servant, not as a cake partially baked, or a vessel not perfected on the wheel, but perfect and entire; wanting nothing. [sic] And in order to this that his gracious purposes may be effectually answered, many strippings of self, many humbling baptisms must be experienced: the will & the wisdom of the creature must be laid low, that that which is [page number] 106 of God may be exalted, that holy seed of Life, which shall possess the gate of his enemies, & in which alone shall all the nations (sects & societies) of the earth, as well as all the families of men be blessed. +++++
