Tent Lodge, Comiston July 4th. 1808-
I have waited my dear Friend till my patience
[unclear]is[/unclear] exhausted, in the vain hope of receiving your Book; but as
[unclear]I[/unclear] am fearful you will think I have quite forgotten you, I will wait
[unclear]no[/unclear] longer — I shall be truly glad to hear from yourself that the
publication is as profitable, as I doubt not it will prove instructive,-
I hope my not having received it, arises from its rapid
sale, which has left no copy of the 1st Edition. By the bye, I perceived
Sale, which has left no copy of the 1st Edition. By the bye, I perceived
by the last Newspaper that a Bill is now passing through
the House of Commons, which extends the Copy-right to 88 years,-
& limits thinks the number of copies to the Universities & Public Libraries
[unclear]to[/unclear] 11 — Those, who do not furnish the copies required have [underline]no Copy-right.[/underline]
The little Work in which I am interested, has met with a
most indulgent reception, the 1st Edition only came out on the 22d
April, & was all sold in less than a Month.— a 2d Edition is now
publish'd — What the Reviewers will say to it, I know not, — but I
have hopes that they will not condescend to notice it — I believe
they cannot injure the Sale — The Engraving is not yet finish'd,

but I hope will be ready for a 3d Edition which will probably come
out in Septr., with an additional Volume, containing a translation
of some of Klopstocks Works —I have been requested to publish
of some of Klopstocks Works - I have been requested to publish
the Book of Job by Subscription,— which I have refused doing,—
the Book of Job by Subscription, - which I have refused doing, -
saying, that if the Sale of the present little Volume will enable
me to publish it, I will not refuse to have it & the Hebrew text
printed together — Dr. Magee of Trinity College Dublin, has given
his opinion of the merit of the Translation, (as you will see if
you ever get the little Book) in terms highly gratifying —
I am at length got into my new Cottage, & the surrounding
Scenery is so Sublime & Beautiful, that I am in great danger
of becoming intolerably idle,— I catch myself frequently in the
of becoming intolerably idle, - I catch myself frequently in the
course of the day, dwelling with delight on the Prospect, when I ought
to be otherwise occupied - Thank God! "The Lot has fallen unto me
in a fair Land" — & tho' in this Life I can say little for "the goodly
Heritage" — yet I gratefully feel the blessing of a contented Mind,
& confess I possess much more than I deserve — I am disappointed
in not seeing our worthy Friend Thos. Wilkinson this
quarterly Meeting, but he writes to me that his Stay must be
made, & hopes the next Quarter may allow him more leisure time.
No one delights more in the beauty of my Situation than he does;

and as he is Nature's own Child, with fine genuine taste, I am
not a little proud of his approbation — My Major has pass'd the
last nine Months here, having had a Recruiting Party in the
Neighborhood; but he has just received orders to hold himself
in readiness to join the Regimt., so that a few days will probably
terminate his visit — He is remarkably well, but as little disposed
to leave home as ever, for he exclaims with the Poet —
"Home! word delightful to the heart of Man,
And Bird, & Beast! small word, yet not the less
Significant: — Comprising all!
Whatever to affection is most dear,
Is all included in that little word. —
Wife, Children, Father, Mother, Brother, Friend!"
I never apologise for a quotation which expresses my meaning, better
than I can myself. I have spent at least an hour in search of your
last kind letter, but to no purpose,—for tho' I am confident I have it, yet
last kind letter, but to no purpose, - for tho' I am confident I have it, yet
for the present it is lost to me - If I recollect right it contain'd good
accounts of all my old Friends at Ballitore; I must beg you to remember
me very kindly to them,—I am sure I shall never forget all their friendly
me very kindly to them, - I am sure I shall never forget all their friendly
attentions — Who lives in the Bewleys Cottage? I rejoice that the School
is improving, & hope you will love to see it as respectable & flourishing, as
is improving, & hope you will live to see it as respectable & flourishing, as
I understood it was in your Father's days. We have the finest Weather
imaginable, our Hay crops are abundantly good, & our Grain promises to
be equally so, — I expect this Evening I shall have housed 62 loads of Hay without

rain — Mrs. Keatings is again return'd into this Country, & I understand [unclear]may[/unclear]
to settle here, - her Daughter & Kearney have taken a place in the neighborhood
for some years I am told — pray tell me (in confidence) what degree
estimation Mrs. Keatings was generally held in amongst you, I am obliged
conclude hastily, but in great Sincerity I am affectionately Yrs.
