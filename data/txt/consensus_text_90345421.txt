Philip Charlie and I accompanied
by Dick took a pleasant walk
after breakfast, to Ballyman where
Philip treated us to jam luncheon
in his parlour. We spent a
good while in admiring his pretty
ducks which were sporting about
in the pond, cutting all sorts of
Antics, pecular to themselves. Three
handsome aristocratic [insertion]looking[/insertion] geese joined
them after awhile, and sailed about
with an important air, as if quite
conscious of their superior size,
and three fine foals scampered
about the field apparently enjoying
themselves to a great extent.
It is delightful to see animals
11 Monday. Who should come out
this evening but Uncle Francis whose
lively company was [unclear]very[/unclear] welcome.
Poor Charlotte seems but middling
and went to bed early.
[deletion][unclear][/unclear][/deletion] happy!
Uncle F went in next [unclear]mdu[/unclear].
