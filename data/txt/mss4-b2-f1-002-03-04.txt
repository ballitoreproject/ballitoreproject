My dear James, 


+++ The general state of the society is low - the general state of meetings must therefore be low - Some individuals have happily embraced the visitations of Truth mercifully extended to them, & diligently cultivated the renewings of them to their minds - those grow in grace, and are monuments of mercy - In like manner & like mercy some sittings of meetings are favoured to be as solemn assemblies, holy convocations - We may let such seasons slip out of the faculty of our memory, as to recollection of time and place: this matters not - but the great point is to accumulate the precious treasure, to add heap to heap, bags which wax not add, with covetous industry - [pg number] 202 Diligence and Frugality, in a moral sense, are said to be the handmaids of Providence - and tis these which enable the religious man to be liberal to others & to bring faith out of his treasury, like the good householder; things new and old - Believe me, dear James, I have a hearty contempt for myself, & I by no means hold myself as a model in this respect - But I dearly love this Cause, and think it ten thousand pities that it should fail among men; for nothing ever came into the world more excellent, more precious, more noble than the holy principle which we profess - As the heavens are higher than the earth: so is this Holy thing above all sublunary interests and concerns - ++ I met with Lydia, Debby & Molly at Mountrath - it was a feast to me to converse with them - I think Lydia gains ground fast - the precious dew methought appeared in her sweet countenance, and her eyes suffused with tears were a cordial to my heart. ++++ Doubtless thou hast heard of the failures of our friends at  it is a melancholy thing. Better to be poor & seem poor - We read indeed that Ravens were sent to feed one of old; but then he was a prophet, one who stood in the faithfulness and obedience to the holy call; separated from the spirit of the world.
