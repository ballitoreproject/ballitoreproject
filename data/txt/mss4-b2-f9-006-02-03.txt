Ballitore: 17/8 month 1775
My dear Cousin, 
        +++ Tis true there is an ineffectual bemoaning, & a looking ^the wrong way^ for help: but there is also a time & a season & a freedom in which we may unbosom ourselves in some degree to our intimate friends, & sometimes not unprofitably, deep calling unto deep. For my part, I know nothing ^no better^ way than diligently to keep up the watch unto prayer, & ^to wait^ in simplicity for the operation of the Spirit of Truth to appear in its own way & manner, & do its present office, according to the present occasion; for manifold is the Grace of God. This, with a faithful, honest discharge of what we are made sensible to be our duty is the way, & the only way for us to gather strength, & get the better of our many infirmities both of flesh & spirit. At least, I have so learned, ^&^ wish I could always so practise. It may sometimes not be of much use any way to dwell too long & often on the contemplation of the degenerate state of our religious Society. When this view is brought before us in the vision of Life ^light^ it is good, it is productive of humbling baptism in sympathy with the oppressed seed, & of strong cries for its deliverance. But if we look at this declension with the eye of human reason only, we may be much deceived, & pierce ourselves with sorrows of our own making, as well as heat ourselves with sparks of our own kindling. There may be many of the Lords anointed at present hid among the stuff, who when they are in due time brought forth will appear taller by the head & shoulders in religious stature than the generality of their brethren. And many goodly personages, who are like elder brothers, & heirs apparent in the family, yet are known by Him who sees the heart to have forfeited the pre-eminence of their birth-right, & not to merit the rank which they are fond to assume. Let us, my beloved friend, make it our [page number] 56 principal care & endeavour to get a settlement in a quiet & still habitation, in taking diligent heed to ourselves, that our own hearts & hands be kept clean, and simply doing, according to the best ability afforded, that little portion of the great work which appears to be our proper business: so shall we witness that peace and tranquility of mind which cannot be enjoyed but as our obedience keeps pace with knowledge, & be freed from a numberless train of disquietudes & perplexities which were ever attend a negligent or partial performance of our duties, growing from strength to strength, & increasing in the increase of Good. ++++
        Certainly nothing is better than religion for use & ornament. If it be the will of the great Creator Dispenser of the cup of life to pour out many prosperous circumstances, Religion preserves in the moderation, & gives the best relish to our the sweets. If trouble & adversity be mingled in a great degree, Religion supports & comforts, sweetens the potion & makes it salutary. ++++
very affectionately thine
Richard Shackleton
