she saved a great deal, yesterday
she was clear and collected
for a while, but today
quite incoherent, so much so
just now that I don't think
I can write to thee as I would
wish she has not any very
alarming symptoms but the
Doctor says he would rather
she had some marked one
that he might have something
to work on, he says it is a sort
of low fever that is very hard
[insertion]decided[/insertion]
to give and opinion on
My Aunt is rather better today
she has been very ill -
the day after Mary left Ballitore
I received a letter from my Aunt
telling me of poor Margaret being
in a fever I wished greatly to
come and attend her and
knew from Marys kind disposition
that she would not [insertion]refuse my[/insertion] request,
so wrote next day to
both her and my Aunt of my
intention, and the day after
got their answers, Marys setting
me at liberty and my Aunts
giving a very favourable account
of dear Margaret, still I did
not feel easy not [insertion]to[/insertion] come &
set out that day, I was fugyting
myself all the way to
know whether I was doing right
or wrong, it seemed a foolish
thing, but when I came to leaper I
found my Aunt very ill with
the dyssentery and poor Margaret
much worse than I at all expected
She [insertion]my Aunt[/insertion] was very glad I was come
and that day had had a letter
written to hasten me, t[unclear][/unclear]
may be sure I was well pleasd
I came I thought I would just pass over to see
thee before I entered the fever room but was disapointed
not to find thee at home -
I am afraid to let myself hope, knowing
the great uncertainty of fevers, I am longing
for the Doctor to come and for all that feel
frightened when I hear his foot on the stairs - 
I would be very glad if thou would comfort me
by writing a few lines to me sometimes while I
am as dismal here, I want willingly pay a
[underline]penny[/underline] for the gratification any time
farewell my dear Sarah - thine truely
This is a shameful note, but thou wilt excuse me

I had also, when the poor child is not wandering
she says how pleasant it is to have me
about her, and let it terminate as it will, it
will be a satisfaction to me, I have thought
since I came of what thou once said to me
that thou thought one should go through
with what one believed to be right - all this
time I have been so full of what concerned
myself that I have not asked thee for my
or rather thy little Willie, I would wish to know
how the dear babe is, also the other little ones,
as I was not let to see Margaret the evening
26SE26
1826
2nd day evening
My dear Sarah
I have just received
thy kind note sitting by
my dear Margaret's bedside
where I have been pretty
constantly since I came
to town, she is extremely
ill, though the Doctor did
not speak so discouragingly
this morning as he did
these few days back, inded
he did not seem to have
much expectation of her getting
through, thou may think
I have suffered a good deal
from anxiety and suspense
and may say I do still as no
decided change has taken place
