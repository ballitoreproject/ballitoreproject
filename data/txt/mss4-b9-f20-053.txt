air agrees with M & also to tell what I
can to do ever thy
SB 25 of 2nd mo 1829
My dear Elith give my dear love to Fanny
I am weary waiting for an opportunity, so
I try the post, Thou wert not well gone When
two visitors came to see thee Edw McGuire to apologize
for not stopping to speak to thee on 1st day when he
met thee coming from meeting he had been
out before breakfast & had not got home to clean
himself & was so very far from nice or clean
unshaven & all that he really was ashamed
to show himself he came the morning thou went
I assured him that thou would excuse him & that
at any rate I did not think thou saw him at all
however I find since that thou did see him, the
other visitor was Betsy Bewley she was disappointed
at not finding thee here, she had just
return'd from a drive in a car to Rathmines & the
children were so noisy that it shorten'd her
visit & was very unsatisfactory & I had no one
present to send them away with & no fire
in the Library so that all was unpleasant
as I would like when friends call to have
a little conversation with them, however
when the chits are rear'd I may enjoy my friends
when the chicks are rear'd I may enjoy my friends
if I live poor Margt carryst a great cold

since thou left us & frighten'd us greatly
I sent for Dr Henry who advised that I should
lose no time in taking her to the country
& we now only wait for fine weather
my mother invited her & me to go to her house
so this is much preferable to taking all
to the Cottage & much less trouble to
me as thou may guess I was glad to
hear that F Langford had departed & hope
thou wilt soon be relieved of all, every
one in this house except myself & George
caught cold & were coughing what harmony!
thou only began the cold which I hope has
since left thee I wish thou could often
slip up to see us I dont know when
I had so much satisfaction in a visit
only it was far too short, H Pim
still languishes she is reasonably better
& then ill again but no hopes are entertain'd
of her recovery Joseph Harvey is thought
better also Dr Eustace, I was in hopes of
seeing Doctor Henry to day to deliver thy
message but could not get out I mean to write
a note to him & I think he will answer it
to thyself, I did not like to put off my
letter any longer, give my dear love to Deborah
I will write when I can Willy is very well
& gay I think I will take him with me to
the Glen, I believe Deb has a little account
against me I wd wish to have it when
convenient as I wd like to settle all accounts
before the 4th mo I was delighted to hear
such good news of her - poor Sally White
has been dissatisfied in finding the
Dentist ill but she does not suffer
pain & I hope will be the better [unclear][/unclear]
to, [unclear]been[/unclear] What is to be done by having
time to recover often all she suffer'd
she is pleasant & cheerful as usual
I have not been out since thou went
except in the car once with the [unclear][/unclear]
& once to see my aunt [unclear]Manliss[/unclear] who is
better & in good spirits altho' her [unclear][/unclear] is
quite useless & [unclear][/unclear] to a board ES is
with her still very deaf & very odd I
have not seen Betty Johnson since
do not mind the [unclear][/unclear] rug on [underline]my[/underline] account
just please thyself write to me

soon it is pleasant to hear any thing
about Ballitore give my dear love to Mary
Doyle & to Abby I have done naught since
about Margt I have been taken up so much
with my own Margt's illness, Willy calls
Margt Wilkes great big Margt she was
bled since for a terrible cough & nose [unclear]she[/unclear]
& mother has been here pretty much
I long for one good servant who I could rely
on both as to work & honesty this [unclear]will return[/unclear]
is good & honest but I fear cannot get thro' our
work she is very decent
Elizth Leadbeater
Ballitore
give my dear love to Betsy
when thou sees her I had two
kind notes from her which
I have answer'd but have no
way of sending
I must go
give the
chits there
supper &
put them to
bed
