My dear Eliza
I got thy letter on sixth day evening
which thou sent by Rachel Burton, and the parcels
I got save the dahlia roots I set immediately
thou hast since heard from Frank and has settled
I suppose to wait for him, last evening was the regular
time to receive a letter from thee but I suppose
thou thinks it not yet due. We are all well at
the Glen Edward & the boys dined at Richards on
first day, we all drank tea there, Sam Wright dined
with us, and came down there to tea. Sarah was
out yesterday she brought Richard to us and Willie
to Elizth as she is going to Ballitore herself for Philip
either fifth or sixth day. I came in with her last
night and intend going out again to day. the Fennells
came out on sixth day last. Did thou hear
of the dreadful accident that happened at Dalkey
Olivia is [underline]married[/underline] to a Captain in the army
six feet four I forget his name, could it be the
big man was there one day we called to pay
a visit, if so I dont admire her task as to [underline]look[/underline]
when we came in at night we found [unclear]Ed[/unclear] at tea
& having joined him he told us to guess who amongst
our acquaintances was married & that to an officer

I at once guessed Susan Gamble, but no it was Olivia
Thomas H had been telling him on second day and
made use of the words "[underline]dreadful accident[/underline]" & Edward
in return asked who was the "[underline]unfortunate man[/underline]"
perhaps thou hast heard it from Bessy before this
and that my news is old, did Frank tell thee that
we called there one evening about a week since and
that Bessy came out to us as we did not dismount,
she told us that there house was set, her mother & Mary
in town buying things for the house, and Olivia at
home, there were many enquiries for thee and hoping
thou would soon be home. I suppose now as the ice
is broke they will all be gone in a short time.
I saw R Buxton the other day she said she saw thee,
that thou looked finely and seemed pretty well, we
wanted Susy Allen to Come pay us her long promised
visit but Ellen's being laid up with her back
and Ed Allen going to Ballitore she could not come
I am sorry it happened so, as thou wilt be expecting
to here from us I believe I shall send this by
post and not wait for Sarah [deletion]and[/deletion] [insertion]as[/insertion] she is not
quite determined what day she will go, if I thought
it would be tomorrow I believe I would give it to
her, and save thee the post. Richard has not
finished his business in Dublin yet, he is often
in town, I wish he was done going in for he can
get but little good in the country half in & half out.

My dear Eliza I intended to have written
 yesterday to [deletion][/deletion] inform [deletion]ed[/deletion] thee of that
piece of news, but Selina has done it
before me I see - [deletion][/deletion] I dare say thou
hast heard it even before this - I thought
to have writtn a few lines to thee, this
while back - but seeing Selina writing so
constantly, and Francis once or twice, I knew
they left me nothing to say - unless I invented
it - I hope thou art enjoying thyself
this fine weather, the country must
look delightful now - dost thou go
out often - we are just getting on here
as usual - Francis desires his love and says
that perhaps, if nothing happens more than
he knows, he might go for thee, the latter
end of next week - little Emy is as gay as
ever, and out at the Glen yet - oh it is a nice
thing to have her out there - I feel very
grateful to my Mother for all her kindness
to her - J R is well and still increasing in size
and weight - Jane Stephens is still poorly and very
weak - she has no appetite - Selina is hurrying me
so must conclude with dear love, ever thyne Lucy

I now resume the pen having declined it in
 favour of [insertion]Lucy[/insertion] as thou wilt perceive, I have but little
more to say or to tell thee, I have already said
that we were well, Emmy is growing quite stout
She is not actually able to run but she walks very
stout, tho' a little thing at times upsets her I think
She will know thee, she has made no attempt at
speaking yet. I heard the other evening of Paddy's being
married to Betty Bergan so he did not leave her to go
to Van Diemen's Land neither has Johnny Evans gone
Manliff has them both employed at the pond, as they are
enlarging it, Edward has subscribed five pounds & Richard

three towards fixing it properly and getting a boat, John has not
given any thing yet, they [unclear]shall[/unclear] is J & Martha have not been near
us this great while they are quite deserting us I suppose thy
not being at home there is but little inducement particularly
as they are always sating at us for being so dull. Martha has
had the influenza but is well again tho' she says she feels very
weak. I hope thou wilt not take it, how is Elizabeth, give my
love to her & to Cousin Betsy and accept a large share from thy
affectionate Sister
Selina
I have heard nothing about F W since he went to the country
so I suppose he is well or we would have heard to the conntry
did thou hear that Sam proposed sending him to Sir
Patrick Dunn's hospital that time he was so ill. what a
[underline]brotherly act[/underline].
I write this at Werburgh Street
