London September 29/47
My dear Eliza
I received yours of 27th
[unclear]just[/unclear] this morning and according to yr
request hasten to reply to Same.
I perfectly recollect the circumstance
of A D. speaking to me, but am not
so sure of what my answer was,
the truth is, I was so surprised and
at the same time so confused
at the unexpectedness of the interview
that I do [insertion]not[/insertion] remember what I said
in reply, I certainly held out no hope,
that what M seemed so anxious for
could ever be accomplished, and distinctly
deny that I ever made her such a
proposal, even if I had, I ask you
was it the part of a modest woman
to mention the circumstance even
to her father or mother without
my permission, certainly not, and
it was this very feeling restrained

me at the time from speaking
as openly as I should have done,
knowing she was to blame I could
not bring myself to hurt ADs feelings
by telling him what I thought
of his daughter's conduct, which I
say again was not that of a truly
modest woman even when viewed in
connexion with the most extenuating
circumstances. So unsatisfactory
was said conversation to both parties,
that I [deletion][/deletion] [insertion]daily[/insertion] expected AD. would
have written to me on the subject,
when I was fully determined to let
him know my thoughts without mincing
the matter and to end the
affair for ever, as he did not do
 so I supposed they [deletion][/deletion] had thought
better of the subject, and determined
on letting it die a natural death, such
not being the case, and judging from
part of yr letter that my last was
not quite Satisfactory even to you
I write this additional explanation, as
I would indeed be unhappy, did
I think that you or those dear to
me supposed that I had acted otherwise
than uprightly in this unpleasant
business. I wish very much that
you had received my letter at the
time of yr conversation with AD.
that that you had shewn it to him,
I dare say it would have put an
end to the conduct, which will injure
the authors ten times more than it
will me, and the policy of which is
so very questionable.
What annoys me most and it does
so very much, is that it will be [insertion]the[/insertion] cause
of breaking the intimacy which existed
between AD and me, as I have indeed
a great regard for him, and believe
him to be free from any blame,
and I am very sorry [insertion]now,[/insertion] I did not
write to him before his wife and
daughter came to Dublin as I was
often tempted to do, it might have
prevented their exposing themselves as
they have done.

I have nothing more to add on
this subject, but to repeat what I
stated in my last, that my conscience
is free from self reproach except in not
having spoken more openly to AD, the
reasons for which I have already told you,
and I will now turn to other matters.
I called on Mr Crawford several
times but did not succeed in seeing
him until this evening when I took
 tea with him, he leaves London tomorrow
so I do not expect to see him
again, as some compensation for
this disappointment I met Jas Pike
by accident last night and hope to
have the pleasure of his company sometimes,
I wonder you did not tell me
he was in London. We went to day
to Kew Gardens in company with a
german, who lodges here, he is an
Engineer and on his way to some
great house in Newcastle, where he
will remain for some time, we have
taken a great fancy to him and hope
to see him in Ireland next year.
he is a great mechanic[unclear][/unclear] and I believe very clever,
although he does not know English well yet with the help
of E.E.s german we get on very well together.
I got Richards letter to me at the post office here
 having left word with the post master at Bruselles to
forward it to London, please tell him I am obliged
for it. I hope to write to Martha tomorrow
or next day; tell her I do not forget.
I do not think I would like to call on Mr Boyd
perhaps I would only be a trouble to him.
It is now very late so I will subscribe myself with
love to all at home your affectionate Brother
Arthur
