	My Dear Samuel,
		With great pleasure yesterday evening I received thine, giving account of thy dear wife being on the recovery (from a fever). I hope thou wilt have to continue us like favourable reports, till she is able to  confirm them with her own hand. I am in sentiment with thee, that this trial may have been permitted for good purposes: we may see thereby, and by numberless instances, how uncertain is the state of human prosperity, and how soon the fairest buildings of our imagination, our hopes and our schemes may be dashed to pieces. We live in a world, where from a multitude of causes, we may be made most wretched and miserable, and miss of a place of rest hereafter. What need have we then to walk awfully in humble thankfulness, when we enjoy all the necessaries and conveniences of life, and when this life is rendered by our Almighty Benefactor not only tolerable, but comfortable: yea, when in the infinity of his condescending goodness, he is graciously pleased to superadd to his temporal favours, the visitations of his Holy Spirit, to prepare for us, and afford us an earnest of eternal salvation. May you, my dear children, keep your vessels, (your hearts,) clean and empty, waiting in abstractedness of thought and nothingness of self, that these vessels may receive some of the blessed effusion, which will preserve you, will strengthen you to go through the duties of this life with alacrity, and qualify you to be of some service in the church in your day. I have unity with you both in your baptisms, in your dedications, and in your resolutions, that you will choose the Lord & his service, and not the world and its spirit, for the lot of your inheritance, and the petition of my heart is for your growth and establishment in the most precious truth. Amen!
							R. S.
