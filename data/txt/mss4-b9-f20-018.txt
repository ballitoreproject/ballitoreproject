My dear Elit
McAvoy came here to day & offer'd £10 per ani
for the house McDaniel had in addition to his own
& £11 if he got the yard between [unclear]J Glaigebrook's[/unclear] farm
& Mc Daniels house & a little spot to build a cow house
on Would thou take the trouble of looking at what
he wants & if thou think proper ret it to him
for £11 per ani he is talking of taking the field
at the back of the houses but more of this another
time I am anxious to get the new houses finish'd
& not perhaps thou would agree with some one
to finish them, our hopes are very waneing
about poor Emily who is still very ill, we
have just heard of Anna Simmon's death of
a fever which makes us doubly anxious,
Tell Deb with my dear love that I rec'd her
eggs &c & am much obliged I sent the flour
& biscuits to M C, I did not say a word to them
in my last about the eggs & apples I rec'd by Ally
which were very acceptable I wanted to ask
what the last feathers I got came to

I did not weigh them nor can I now as I have
parted with one of the beds I imagine the
feathers are not the best kind however
they will do as well enough when I get a
new tick - keep an account with me
& put down the postage of letters [underline] of business [/underline]
as I have no one to send to post pay this
& besides I would like to keep a seperate
account of the money I am to have out
of Ballitore, I hope Ally will answer well
she seems fond of nursing I wish thou would
soon write & tell how thou art going on thyself
Willy seems getting better again but looks very
pale J Nugent call'd here to day with a
bundle of pieces of various kinds for the school
I send them by the carrier also an empty
basket of thine I hope J Allen brought Eben's
coat safe - this time last year we
were in great anxiety about thee poor
Emily is not half so heavily affected yet
her recovery seems very doubtful
I seem as if I were forgetting something

I wish we were within a few miles
of Ballitore I often have business there
- but the distance must keep me at home
little Nezer is well again & very healthy
Dear love to M Doyle ever thy SB
Edw settled the business with the
Postoffice
