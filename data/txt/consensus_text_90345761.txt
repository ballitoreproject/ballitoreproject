Lyd and I went down to see Mrs Kift
to ask the girls to come to spend Tuesday
with us - Uncle Thomas returned with us
which was rather an unusual thing for
him - we met the Kifts on their way
from Church as we returned by the
Golden Ball - Mr Evelyn we met also
escorting the Miss Boltons- - We and Mr [unclear]Cairns[/unclear]
dined here - the latter is professor of
political enconomy - his name is spelled
Cairns - not Kearns -
31 Monday - Walked over to Ballyman
I began my drawing -
May -
