far, when, going down a hill, some part of our
chair broke, which delay'd us a while till
a smyth mended it, so that it was night
when we arrived at Austel. Lodged at John
Veale's. 15th.. Yesterday's journey 20 miles - this day's
about 5 to Mevagissey, having been at meeting

(Cornwall) & Edward Bastail accompanying us.
Lodg'd at Mary Rawe's. 16th.. meeting with
friends in the morning, with those not of
our society in the evening, S:T has got a little
fellow-labourer in E:Bastail, who in meeting
this evening said, "Where the sun is, there is
"no occasion for a candle, & where the wisdom
"from above is, there is no occasion of earthly
wisdom". 17th.. 26 miles to Falmouth, accompanied
by Edward & Jacob Bastail. Lodged
at Richd.. Fox's. 18th.. First-day. A day of much
lowness to me,- yet got a little strength in an
oppertunity at Thos.. Fox's, whose wife has
had a paralytic stroke since a lying-in, upon
whom, as well as other branches of the family,
it seems to have a sweet effect.
