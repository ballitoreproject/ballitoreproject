From the same to the same

Ballitore: 28/10 1776 ^[pencil] x^ 1774

Dear Cousin,

	+++ I hope I preserve a just & grateful sense of the friendship and agreeable correspondence of my particular friends, but when the mind is exceedingly incumbered, & the leisure absorbed by a variety of indispensable duties, it is as much as it can do sometimes to breathe for its own preservation, much less can it freely open to others. The truly religious man has his goods of best sort, in which both he & his friends delight, locked up in his best room, of which he himself does not keepthe key. If he does not be tampering, in his own time & will, with the lock, if he waits with patience till the good & wise hand opens it, he will ^have^ at times to rejoice in the participation of these goods himself, & be enabled to distribute to his friends. That is a character which I do not think I deserve. I am however at present very busy (beside my ordinary employment) in heaving the world a little out of the ^my^ way, that (if Providence ^so orders^) I may enjoy the company of my friends at the ensuing solemnity +++
	Thine affectionately
		Richard Shackleton
