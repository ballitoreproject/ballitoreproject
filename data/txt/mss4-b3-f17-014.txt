My dear Cousin, 
        I cannot say how gratifying thy kind letters are to me, or how much I admire thy affectionate condescension in noticing me as a correspondent  to shew my gratitude I should be glad to write thee more frequently, but, I am discouraged for want of matter. I know thou art kindly interested in my own concerns, but they admit of no variety of description, I continue in the same predicament which I acquainted thee with at Newington as we walked in the garden, it was, & is, a great consolation to me that thou approved of my conduct, various proposals are made to me by different branches of my own family with regard to my future residence, but I am not capable of coming to any decision, as often as I attempt to look at it & sketch plans for myself, so often I feel secret reproof, & my sincere desire is, to endeavour to resign myself to that allwise [sic] Providence, by whose permission, I trust, I engaged in my present employ  do, my good friend, pray for me, that I may be strengthened to keep, so long as is needful, in this passive state I am afraid of myself  lest from natural affection or apparent eligibility I should be tempted to adopt any thing that is not right for me to do
        Our little Elizabeth has been very much out of health lately  she was a remarkably fine, healthy child & has without ^any^ apparent cause that we at this distance can learn, declined so rapidly as to alarm her Parents very much, the last account of her was rather more favorable than the former ones; if she continue [sic] poorly, I believe we shall return to Norwich in the course of next week I spent the 10th month & part of the 11th with my relations in London. my [sic] dear Mother was remarkably well & capable of enjoying not only the company of her children but everything else that she could desire comfort from  since that time she has had a very severe attack but I am glad to hear is again ^almost^ restored to her usual stateOur little Joshua is a fine thriving Boy the delight of one of the fondest fathers I ever saw. two [sic] weeks of the time I spent at B. Close. much to my satisfaction. the in proportion as my knowledge of my sisters character increases so does my love & respect for herI am much pleased to find thou hast an addition to thy family, & that thy Daughter Leadbeater is so well  thy continuing to live together must tend to your mutual comfort & be the source of many joysWhat can be more delightful than family harmony?I should be pleased to hear that your Richard has derived benefit from bathingWhen thou seest my old, beloved friend Debby Chandlee assure her that I continue to love her with unab[paper torn] affection I am long indebted to her for a very kind letter
        The account of thy journey was truly interesting to the me remember, that even stale bread is delicious to those who have no other food
        No doubt you heard of Edward Gurneys having had something of a paralytick affection  he is now pretty much recovered from it though some of ^his^ friends entertain apprehensions of his never being perfectly restoredMy dear Agatha requests thy acceptance of ^her^ lovebe pleased to give mine to every branch of thy family. Mention me with respectful regard to thy valuable Wife and 
        believe me,
                thy affectionate & obliged Cousin
