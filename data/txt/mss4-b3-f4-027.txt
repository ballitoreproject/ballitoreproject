Clonmel 3d month 19th 1789

My dear uncle
	I herewith certify that the bearer ^E. Tuke^ is a friend in good unity with church in this house (at least) an honest hearted labourer in it & has a love to the cause of universal righteousness  We know you hold such in reputation & therefore as a beloved sister we recommend her to thy fatherly care & thy familys acceptance of a few days visit from her after the meeting at Montrath, if it is entirely convenient  We leave the disposal of the mare & carriage to her & your discretion it being difficult for us to fix anything about them, as we dont know but H. Pim of Tullalost may return immediately with S. Hancock who is sisters companion & is we think an improving visitted [sic] young woman 
	I know I am indebted to thee for a letter which encouraged me in the needful time to hold out to the end of htat probation in Cork; but my time being very limited (as this journey is rather hastily concluded on) I cannot well say more than that I am thy truly affectionate & obliged SRG
