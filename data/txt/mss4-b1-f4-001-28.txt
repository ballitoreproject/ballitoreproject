R. S to his Daughter Mary.
Concerning his danger on ship-board, coming from England
with John Pemberton and William Mathews
Athy, 23rd of Eighthmonth 1783.
** I had just lain down for the night, when an everlasting
night threatened the visible part of me. The ship struck against
a bank, which they called the Kish, near the place where the
Indiaman, they said, struck some months ago, when near one
thousand, I heard perished. She struck a second and a third time:
it was awful! I thought of poor Edith Lovel and Joseph Sparrow:
and knew not but their fate would have been ours. For a few
minutes I was held in anxious suspense, but preserved from
abject fear: in a few minutes she floated again, and we got off.
This was a preservation to be commemorated with humble gratitude!
