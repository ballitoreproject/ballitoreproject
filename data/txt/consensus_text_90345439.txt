Gabe Fisher and Simmons Walpole
dined here to day, but Charlie
did not make his usual appearance.
24 Monday - [underline]Easter[/underline] Monday too
the morning was cloudy but
the afternoon sunny. There were
races (at Carrickmines I think) to day
which attracted such crowds, the
trains could not accomo-date nearly
all and the doors at Harlcourt st
had to be shut. When they were
over the crush was awful for
as Saunders said "all who had come
out in a great many trains were trying
to go in in [underline]one[/underline]" fortunately there
were no accidents - I believe.
25 Tuesday and Lady day - so a great
holy day, business farming busines
at least at a standstill which is rather
inconvenient this busy time.
26 Wednesday, Papa Grandmama,
John and Edward sat for their photograps
to day and I hope Robinson will
succeed better this time. Papa
