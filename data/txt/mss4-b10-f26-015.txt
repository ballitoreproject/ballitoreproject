Dresden April 4th 1847
My dear Mother
I mentioned in one of my letters
that the 7th was fixed on for Bessie's marriage but
it was obliged to be altered to the 5th as the British
Ambassador [deletion]was[/deletion] is leaving Dresden for some weeks
and we could not wait his return and the
marriage could not take place here except in
his presence - so tomorrow is the day - Easter Monday.
This morning early Easter was announced by
Canons firing & Bells ringing so that I suppose
the whole town & neighbourhood were like ourselves
awakened by them. - We are to be at the Ambassador
at eleven oclock - all our own family and 2 Misses Wagner
& a Monsier Ribet - after the ceremony we come
here to our Hotel have cake & wine and after that
early dinner and then Mr & Mrs Evans Mary
Thos. & I set off on a little excursion to the Saxon [unclear]Levitzers[/unclear]
into Bohemia and as far as Prague see that
curious town and return here - it will take 4 or 5
days to do this I believe - and as soon as we return
we propose to start for home - by Berlin & Hamburgh
once we set out towards Ireland we will not
I am sure make much delay but travel as fast

as possible. We received a letter from Arthur this
evening enclosing the first half of the bank bill
all right - the letter contained a few lines from Edwd
& a few from Willie both and all of which were
very acceptable - We have not seen much variety
since I wrote last - Thos. was very busy at writing
and talking & consulting with the Girls on family
matters - Mr Evans was as busy with his Model
getting a room for exhibition &.&.& and Bessie
had many little matters to arrange - and
the weather besides was cold & gloomy - it was
the last & strictest week in Lent so that all
together I have less to tell you of news than
usual - I do not intend to send this off until
I can tell you the marriage is actually over.
Yesterday we were invited to take Coffee at
Mr Wagners at 1/2 past three and then to go with
them to the Catholick Church to hear the Te Deum
and to see the Royal family go in procession to
High Mass - we did so - we saw the procession
imperfectly as we were too distant and did not
like to encounter the crowd to try to get nearer
the men & women do not sit or stay together so
Thos. was more fortunate than we were as they
passed nearly close to where he was standing.
But the Music was the Grandest I ever
heard any where & we were greatly pleased
with it - it lasted only an hour but we had to be there
some time before in order to get room at all - When
we went to Mr Wagners we found them all
ready for us - Mr Evans was expected but he had
been so busy & was so tired he staid at home
which was quite a disappointment to them
the tea & coffee parapharnalia were all ready
four or five different kinds of China all
nice & pretty but two were Gilt all over and
had the appearance of solid Gold these were
for the Bride & Briddegroom - We had most
excellent Coffee but the making of tea is not
well understood here at all - on a different
table in the room from that on wh. the tea & coffee
were were the cakes in great variety and in the
centre a plate with a wreath of violet made
as Mayl. makes the wreaths of forget-me-not &
in the middle of the plate a Glass containing
violets [insertion]with green leaves intermixed[/insertion] tied in little bouquets which were
handed round to all the strangers & were actually
purchased for the purpose - I never saw such quantities
of violets as are to be seen here in the Streets &
in the windows of the houses - I cannot make out
how they are managed - for the Gardens have little
or nothing in them yet - We were at a Flower
show also some day in the week - it was small
in comparison to what we have in Dublin but

in some respects it was more nicely arranged it could
open for several days and when we saw it some of the
flowers seemed to me to be drooping a little - I have
not seen one Fuchsia since I came here I think
I saw one plant only since I left home - I was
very much surprised not to see them in the Show
of Flowers - they are so common with us that I wonder
they have them not here - there were roses in blow
and Peas in blossom - but neither Geraniums nor Fushias
I fear from the accounts we hear matters are not
improving in poor Ireland - here tho' they say provisions
are dearer than usual there seems to be no want
of food and you see none of the squalid poverty
we are used to at all - it appears to me as if the people
here were much more industrious - and the very
poorest of them have a comfortable tidy appearance
that our labouring classes have no idea of particularly
the women - then they have such a variety of food and
are satisfied with it in such various ways that our people
would laugh at but which I am sure must add to their
comfort tho' I doubt if it would to that of the poor Irish
at least until they got used to it - I myself find it
hard enough to [insertion]be[/insertion] reconcile to some of their odd compounds
and were it not for the potatoes & bread which are both
generally good I should fare badly sometimes - but we
every day have some meat I can eat - it is very good
if we could get it plainly dressed - but we cannot always
get it so - but what matter these things are some of the
charms of travelling in foreign countries -
