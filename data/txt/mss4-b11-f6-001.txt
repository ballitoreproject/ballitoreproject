Dear Cousin
M. Barnard
Notwithstanding 'tis now so long since
I receiv'd thine, yet I had not it in my power to answer it, properly,
sooner, particularly with regard to Cousin T. Gildarks affairs-
I applied immediately, upon the Receipt of thine, to John Squire
who informd me the Dividend was expected to be paid very
shortly, the Day fix'd, so waited till the Time was over on
[unclear]hopes[/unclear] I cou'd have inform'd thee when & in what manner the
Rimattance shou'd be made thee, but now 'tis put off till
Spring, Wm. & John Berkbeck are the principal Creditors
& they will by Bill or otherwise remit thee thy share as soon
as paid, the Dividend is supposed but to amount to 5s"1d P Pound
but as his Effects are in such safe & hourable Hands
thou mayst besure of having all the Justice done thee
which the unhappy Circumstances of the Debtor will admit
of, Cousin To Geldart is at Liverpoole in a Bookkeeper
Place, his Family along with him, he has used his poor
Mother very ill having strip'd her of every thing belonging
her, & now she is at Ayrton with Neddy Viponts Widow,
in the House she liv'd in, when thou was over in England
& is obliged to accept of Releif from her Friendes which
I am very sorry for, 'tis really a piteous Care at her yeares
to be cast off & left destitute & by an only Son too who
might have been a Comfort to her - Cousin Joseph Hall
has been sometime dead his Dr. A. Tindal & her Husband
live here at Skipton their two sons Charles & Tommy are
at London - Eliz Rawson's Daughter married Wm.
Pickerings Son, they kept shop here some years, but removed
this Winter to London & their Mother along with em'.
As to John Tunstall's Widdow I suppose thou must have heard
of her second Marriage to a Neighbouring Attorney by whom

she has had several Children but all I think dead, John Tunstalls
Daughters are I beleive along with their Mother, his Son is apprentice
to Dr. Sucliffe of Settle & falls Heir to a good Estate, the poor
Girls are not so well provided for, a discretionary power, a pretty
extensive one too, being lodged in their Mother for their Provsion
which the poor Woman by her second Marriage has unhappily
forfeited - My Uncle Fosters Children are all unmarried except
his Daughter Mary who lives at Darlington, his oldest Son &
younger Daughter are both at Home, his second Son was
brought up to the Study of Physick which he has declined,
is now a Wine Merchant in London in so extensive & promising
a Way, that tis thought he clears by his Business [insertion]Â£[/insertion]1000 P ann.
at least, but not likely [deletion]asen[/deletion][insertion]long[/insertion] to enjoy it, for he is in a very
poor Way & tis fear'd in going off - My Uncle Foster is very
Rich, & very covetous, an unnatural Uncle to us his Sister's
fatherless & Motherless Children, takes no Notice of us, he
always look'd above us, & more especially since my Fathers
Death, & notwithstanding our late Misfortune of having
shop Broken & strip'd of one half at least of wt. we [unclear]had be[/unclear]
is so far from regarding it that he scarce ever looks aside
or makes use of us in the Way of Business for any thing -
I suppose you have heard of my Brothers Marriage, a step
very displeasing & disagreable to us his nearest Relations, as well
as to all his best Friends in general, he became very unsettled &
regardless of his Business & Interest after his second Repulse at
Kendal was much drawn into improper Company, but is
now very steady, & circumspect in his Conduct, applies himself
closely to his school which consists chiefly of Day Scholares, all
his Boarders except three being taken from him - My Sister
has been at Wm. Birkbeckes ever since his Marriage, excepting
5 Weeks, she staid with me when I lay inn, my youngest Child
is 20 Weeks old, a fine Girl, but I have had my Health very
poorly almost ever since she was born, having had a Disorder
upon me which keeps one extremely weak & low. & greatly
desheartens & despirits me, but am in hopes the return of Warm
Weather may be a means to restore me - my Brother desires
to be rememberd to thee & Cousins as to the young Women he

has married had she been a Frd. she wou'd have been a likely Woman
for his Business being [deletion]a man[/deletion] a good manager in a House
& seemes to take a great pleasure in the few Boys they have &
they are both very desirous frds. wou'd again encourage em' but
that's an Event must be left to Time & depends much upon
my Brothers Conduct which I have great hopes will continue
to be such as may give Satisfaction to his Frds. & prepare em'
to receive him again into Favour & Unity with em' -
If my Husband or me can be of the least service to thee
in any Respect with regard to thy Affairs here may'st at
all times freely & without reserve command us & if thou
shou'd choose to write to thy Kinsman S. Geldart if pleases
to direct to him to the Care of John Scott Mercht. in
Liverpool who I doubt not will easily find him out
as there are not I apprehend many Frds. in that Place
Please to give my dear Love to Cousin Margaret
Shackleton her Husband & Children & shall be very glad to
receive a Line from any of you when Opportunity offers
I am dear Cousin, with Esteem, thy affectionate Kinswoman

P.S. Cousin S. Tindal saw thy Sister Geldart at Ayrton
the other Day she desired to be rember'd to you all & was
tolerable well -
