My dear Bess -
I have the continued pleasure of being still able
to inform thee of our dear May's being on the mending hand, and that
the young one is well as need be. - Sister S. (who I dined with today) is
better than she has been for several days back. - Mary & the two Johns
& little Eliza very well. -
I hope you are all quite well at R. - may you long
enjoy many years of uninterrupted happiness. - and finally, eternal
felicity hereafter. -
I'm glad the two Boys are with you, - although
they are not [underline]the Boys[/underline] which my dear Father [underline]used[/underline] to have with him
yet I hope he finds some pleasure from their company. -
Inform me soon of how you all are, - also I. Boardman,
- give my love to him. - Did my Father get the Account-Book, it
was sent in a pack to Tom Jackson's? -
My love, Duty & affection ever awaits my dear
Parents & Sisters: - in which my dear Bess is particularly included. -
Farewell, - thine - R. Manliffe
Seventh day - 27 Decr. 94. -
