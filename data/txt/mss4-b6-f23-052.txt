The Snow Storm
The little band were sporting round,
All gay with guiltless glee,
Methought my vivid youth I found
Again restored to me.
We heeded not the tumult wild
Which fill'd the wintry air
For all within was warm and mild
Unvex'd by gloomy care.
We knew not that the tender Sire,
The Consort fondly lov'd
While brightly glow'd his houshold fire,
The tempest's fury prov'd.
Stern Winter with his chilling breath,
Urg'd on the snowy shower

And while each blast seem'd big with death,
He triumph'd in his power.
Drear was was the night! - his homeward path
My William trod alone,
While round his head in stormy wrath
The blinding snows were blown.
