129			R. S. to his Son.
				
					Dublin, 4th of Eleventhmonth 1777.
		*** It is a capital favour to have a sound mind in a sound body. Indeed the favours conferred on our house are very great and very numerous: the principal is the Divine visitation, which I wish may be embraced with due gratitude and humility by us all. It is an holy thing, not to be trifled with, not to be put in competition with any other thing; not to be put off with a ‘Go,’ and tarry yonder, and ‘at a convenient season I will call for thee;’ but received with open heart, and into the uppermost chambers there. Next, health of body. Then, kind, and tender, and dear relations and friends, and the means of procuring every necessary of life. Let none of these favours escape our notice, but be the subjects of our grateful contemplation; that so He that delights to do his creatures good, in blessing may continue to bless us, and to protect and help us. ***
						R. S.
