My dear friend
J Harvey - We received
thy kind note at Sall Hill yesterde,
& I quite hoped to have
acknowledged it after meeting
this morning - I should have
preferred to have visited thee
remembering the interest and
kindness of past days, but our
friends have really engaged us
so closely that I don't at present
see any time - if one should

present I will make [unclear]sure[/unclear] to call
or write -
Thy sincere friend
John [unclear]Peale[/unclear]
