My dear Friend
Owing to a mistake made by the
agent for the proprietors of the Magazine, the account
which I formerly sent thee was incorrect, my Father
therefore desires me to send a correct statement, &
to ask thee the cause of only 7 Magazines being sent
for the last half year. Was M French's discontinued?
He also wishes to know if £3.10 s was paid in the sum;
if it was not, can thou furnish the particular dates.
He has written to E S Lees respecting the £1.5 s for which
thou sent the receipt, & the £2. for which thou mentions
having receipts, but no answer has been received.
If the account is now correct the proprietors of
the Magazine owe thee 13 s. 4d, & thou received from Saml.
Haughton 15 s-. My Father desires me also to apologize
for having written so frequently respecting this account,
but Lees & the Magazine agent were incorrect & negligent
& a correct statement of the account was impracticable

if we had not given thee some trouble - I have now
to request that thou may write to E S Lees & mention to
him the dates for which thou has receipts, & desire
him to acknowledge having received the money.
I am indebted to thee for two letters; the
first I should have answered sooner if I had not been
waiting for my Fathers receiving E S Lees' reply - But
without replying to this letter at present, as fully as
I had intended, I hasten to the question respecting the
machine for dressing flax - Several of the machines
have been lent by the Trustees of the Linen Board to
linen drapers in this part of Ireland. One was sent to a
gentleman in this neighbourhood, & he not wishing
to be troubled with it, lent it to William. Few experiments
can be made [deletion][/deletion] this year, as according to the
usual method of treating flax, steeping it in water
until fermentation appears & then spreading it on a
field to make the wood separate from the fibre, it is
rendered too soft for Lees machines. By the [unclear]plat[/unclear] method
the flax is neither steeped nor laid in a field; very
little has been prepared in this machine, of course a
fair trial cannot be given, but it is the opinion
of the generality of the linen drapers, that Lees' machine
is very imperfect; the principle may be good,
& if not steeping the flax facilitates the process of
bleaching the [unclear]silk[/unclear], a valuable discovery has been
bleaching the linen, a valuable discovery has been
made - I believe only 14 lbs of flax can be cleaned in
The two pieces of linen could not be procured [underline]half bleached[/underline], The
only kind of linen which is half bleached is a kind we call Hillsborough
[unclear]hugs[/unclear] at from 10 to 15 yard, useful for servant sheets &c
If thou does not like the whole bleached, my Father will begin
to bleach in February, & he says he will have two pieces of linen
bought & half bleached for thee but I fear thou would not like
them, as half bleached & not beetled, would make them appear
very coarse & hard -
My Father continues to suffer much from the
pain in his chest & a difficulty of breathing - He is not generally
confined to the house, but very little exertion or walking fatigues
him much & renders him incapable of taking exercise - We certainly.
cannot but feel many apprehensions about him,
but should the pain in his chest not increase, or if it arise from
rheumatism I hope no danger need be apprehended - At least
I am willing to flatter myself with these hopes, as the prospect of
losing him would be to distressing for the mind to dwell on, & the
utmost exertion of fortitude would be insufficient for so dismal
& so distressing an event to be calmly contemplated -
I hope Margaret Shackleton continues not to get worse - Please
tell Betsy I am obliged to her for the few lines on thy letter, & that
I shall be much pleased to receive the letter which she has given

a day by Lee's machine, but if his method of treating
flax becomes general, an improvement may be made
in the machines. William thinks they can be attached
to some of the machines at the bleachgreen.
If Eben should continue his intention of getting one of
the machines, William will draw a plan of the improvement
that he suggests. My Father thinks Eben could
procure one of the machines by applying to one of
the Trustees of the Linen board, a list of whose names
will be found in the Dublin Almanac, provided he
can state that a large quantity of flax is sown in the
neighbourhood, & that having one of the machines
would tend to promote the linen trade in the Co. Kildare.
My Father's testimony of Eben's respectability &c would
be sufficient, as he is little known to
the Trustees, but he thinks it questionable
whether it would be prudent of Eben to cultivate flax
on the new plan, in a country in which the cultivation
according to the old method is not well understood -
There is no premium for sowing flax, there is a premium
for sowing hemp, & for the spinning of hemp & [underline]fine[/underline]
yarn, if the latter is spun from flax prepared by Lee's
machine - I fear the latter is impracticable, as the spinners
of fine yarn in this neighbourhood, pull the flax
very green, in order to make it [insertion]spin[/insertion] fine. Lee direct the flax
to be made very dry previously to using his machines.
That plan may do for Middlesex, where the flax crop
me reason to expect - Even a few lines is always very acceptable
from her - & if she knew the pleasure I feel on receiving her
letters, I am sure she would write frequently - Very truly thy
affectionate
S Hancock

is so early that potatoes can be planted after [insertion]the[/insertion] flax has
been taken off the ground, & where the climate is warmer,
but here the flax crop is late, & it is almost impossible
to prevent it from getting rain - Another difficulty
which Eben would possibly have to encounter is the want
of a market for the flax - If he sent it to the North, he
would not sell it as cheap as persons who have been accustomed
to the culture; besides [insertion]a[/insertion] large quantity of flax is imported
from this country - I have been diffuse on this subject,
& if Eben intends sowing flaxseed we will give him directions
for its culture, but I beg thou may not think
it necessary to make any apology for giving the trouble,
as it is a pleasure to me to be of the smallest use to
my friends -
I shall procure the remnants for thee;
Would thou wish the lawn long enough for handkerchiefs?
