From the same to the same.

My dear friend
+++ The Searcher of the hearts penetrates into the deepest recesses, and labyrinths of it ^the heart^; he knows us better than we know ourselves, he turns often upside down, & inside out; he makes strange commotion in the mind; shakes and unsettles it from every false foundation, that feeling its own weakness, utter incapacity & insufficiency, it may turn with earnest cries and humble, holy importunity to him: to him who has all power in heaven and on earth: the to him who marks the solitary sittings of his own; who bottles up their tears, and as their trust and confidence is in him will not, though he sees meet to prove and try them, leave them altogether comfortless, but will in his own time, assuredly give them his faithful followers victory. All we have ^[pencil addition] to do, or required of us]^ for it [pencil underline], is to keep close to the standard of Truth. Conquest and happiness assuredly attend it, and though conflicts and exercises belong to the warfare, yet glory and triumph crown its end.

If we do not get to drink at the Spring we shall never be furnished and qualified for service. And if we do not take particular pains and give assiduous attention to keep the way of access to it open, we shall be in danger of losing ground, and falling into error, let our stations & former experiences be what they may.
