Richard Shackleton to Elizabeth Pike

Ballitore 19th of 1st month 1757.

My dear friend
++ Dont [sic] spare putting us to the expense of postagefor a much greater expense is little in comparison of the [word crossed out] of hearing from thee, and feeling thee in the precious unity of the Spirit and Covenant of Life, in which I desire we may all be preserved, that so we may all be preserved that so we may be a comfort and help to one another, amid the various besetments and disagreeable occurrences which are like to attend us in this warfare. Dear Friend, look to the crown that is at the end of the race, and the cross will be the more easily borne.
