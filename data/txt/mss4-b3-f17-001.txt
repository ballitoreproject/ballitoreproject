My dear friend


        I am too sensible of the favour of thy visit, not to make thee welcome; thou shalt partake of any thing my house afford - I will not even wait to procure other provision than thou found there, that I may if possible induce thee to come soon again
        I am really sorry for thy sister Carletons [sic] additional malady, such a succession of complaints requires a constant exercise of fortitude she has been so often I may say dangerously attacked, and so often wonderfully relieved, that I flatter myself there is yet room for hope  So tender a flower as thy dear Molly will be liable to be shaken by every blast, but she may not be so soon cut off as a hardyer [sic] stem; I shall be glad to hear that she recruits  I know your sympathetick hearts will be concerned at my poor Mothers indisposition, I wish I could say she was better but my friend! almost every week adds additional gloom in my anticipation, her life is of so much consequence that (I own my weakness) I am sometimes almost ready to sink under the prospect of losing her; though a woman of small profession, and desirous of being concealed, rather than conspicuous she has experienced many warfares, & has wonderfully supported her houshold [sic], and though she has had many comforts, she [corner torn] been rendered incapable of enjoying them, either from anxiety of mind or bodily pain 
        Thy reflections and advice were very applicable to my situation though the present view of things shews me many a bitter cup, it would be ingratitude indeed, not to feel and acknowledg [sic] the many blessings we have, and do, receive - I only wish to be worthy a continuance of them; thou says Bring thy vessel clean and empty but my friend! this is the most difficult lesson I have to learn, the things of this world are of such an adhesive quality, and my portion of the water of life so small, that my daily endeavours will not make it pure  Though nothing is more painful to a generous mind than to receive direct acknowledgments of favours granted I wish thee to know how much I feel myself obliged by thy letter. I persuade myself I am enjoying a little tete  tete with thee, and only for this persuasion I could not converse with so much freedom as I do; for though I have not a wish to appear to the world better than I am, yet there are some people so very sanguine as to expect an entire reformation, when thy know of any serious reflection, though these very reflections in reality discover the weakness of the party  I own this has often been a restraint on me, and prevented my taking a part in the best conversation 
        Our mutual friend Alice Chorley spent some time with me lately, from not having any Rival here, I enjoyed more of her conversation than usual: she is in my view a find picture of nature adorned by religion.
        Next month I look for our Elizas return I suppose thou and she have had many interviews: Johnnys going for her is yet uncertain - It is a very great satisfaction to us that my sister Grubb is so happily settled, and that her new connections are so very pleasing to her.
        I am joined by my Mother in every sentiment of affection for thee & thine including thy sister Carleton - And do, my dear friend believe that thy ^visits^ shall always be gratefully received by
                Thy Obliged Hannah Pim
