My dear Friend


        Its [sic] cause of wonder to my self that I should attain sufficient courage toa address thee in this way, but I shall honestly confess, that thy saying, when we last parted at Birmingham, thou should be pleased to hear from me, has frequently recurred to remembrance, & I some time since made an attempt to write thee, but according, to my wonted manner, let in discouragement, & laid my pen aside.
        An oppertunity [sic] now presenting of conveying a letter by the Friend that has kindly conducted our Beloved Friends to their native Land, I feel the revival of an inclination to commune with thee, from a secret beleif [sic] that thou will accept my intention therein  having no view, but a desire if consistant [sic] with the will of the Master to be had in thy remembrance as a poor little child, that desires to step safely along; but feels itself always in danger of falling & stands much in need of the Parents [sic] care. And we may thankfully acknowledge the abundant care and tenderness of our Heavenly Father over those, whom he has made desirous of being subject to his Will yet oh! the need we have of the help of the Fathers [sic] outwardly: how often do I lament the want of it amongst us, I mean, truly weighty Elders such as are quick of feeling  and able to sympathise [sic] from living experience, being baptized with the suffering seed. Often my dear Friend have I viewd [sic] thee in this light, & should think myself favoured to receive at thy hand  coucel [sic], caution or reproof; therefore if at any time any thing should arise communicate it freely. There is a natural reserve in my disposition that frequently prevents me from expressing my feelings, even to those whom I have been made to beleive [sic] feel love & tenderness towards me  & towards whom, perhaps a more open behaviour might be attended with profit to myself; but this turn of mind added to the consciousness of my unworthiness  many times makes me appear distant where near Union subsists, as was the case in our late interview. & has caused me since, rather to regret such an oppertunity [sic] missed. however [sic], if I should be so favored as to have sometimes a place in thy remembrance I belive [sic] it will be for my good.
        Thou canst readily suppose how acceptable the return of our dear Friends is to us  especially as we have a comfortable beleif [sic] it is in the right time. and [sic] I trust our beloved antient Friend will close her days the more peacefully for this late sacrifice.
        That near Union which mercifully subsists between Dear D.D & my self (and which has been a blessing to me, not to be expressed) makes it always joyful to meet  altho we are also willing to part for the works [sic] sake. often [sic] have I wishd [sic] in this late seperation [sic] that she might be made as much a Mother to some of the youth amongst you  as she has been to divers in her own Land  who cannot forget her umwearied travel for their deliverance  & enlargement in good  and I trust are humbly desirous of being thankful to the Father of mercies for all his benefits, tho under a sense of weakness  are often ready to say what can I [seal] unto him in return I seem utterly incapable of [seal] ^(of doing)^ any thing likely to tend to his honour  I am so one [seal] with infirmities; this is often the secret language of some of our spirits  yet when a little favoured with the openings of that light which is indeed precious  we find, we have nothing to do  but simply to obey the manifestations of truth as they gradually arise  and that indeed our preservation intirely [sic] depends upon it  this simple child-like obedience  oh! how is it wanting  & how sorrowfully the reasoner [?] prevails. & frustrates the designs of Infinite Wisdom. Well dear Friend I seem to have forgot my fears  and scribble in much freedom  I hope thou will excuse all imperfections  & accept my dear love which also flows to thy family, particularly ^to^ those I have seen  may they, with myself be enabled to follow on to know the Lord. our [sic] family unite in dear love to thyself which concludes me thy affectionate
        Friend Rebecca Young
