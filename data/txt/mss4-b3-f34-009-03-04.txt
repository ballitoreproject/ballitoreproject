My dear friend, 
        I have been perusing again thy very long & very long & very kind, intelligent letter ++ ^[pencil] X^ It is not always that communications between intimate & feeling friends can be upon religious subjects  the key of that treasury is in better hands than of any mortal  but we may support an intercourse in another line  if not to edification, yet to gratification. I am sensible that as long as I have a family, I cannot want a subject interesting & grateful to thee, & I am persuaded that thou dost justice to my friendship in forming a similar judgment of my attachment to thee & thine. ++++ Sally is at home with us  an excellent example of industry, quietness, humility & unaffected simplicity. The fountain of her heart, I trust, is in a good degree made pure, so that what issues from thence has the savour of life  She is not very frequent in her gospel-effusions  but sometimes appears in that line  always I believe acceptably to others  but I believe is hard set to please herself  This I apprehend (from my own little feeling experience) is no uncommon case. It is probably in the wise economy of the great & good Master that flesh may be kept from glorying  doubting & diffidence & fear of being wrong has also its [sic] use with the creature  that there may be a being inured to a steady, patient, watching & waiting, & trying & examining what rises in the mind, & so there may be a becoming learned in spirit, & skilful to make a difference. For, as in other schools, so in the school of Christ, [page number] 138 learning is attained by degrees, & by frequent application & repetition  & in this school there is often occasion for mistakes to be amended, faults corrected, & scholars to be not only instructed, but reproved, & even sometimes punished. There is also occasion for observation, use & long practice, to promote a growth in religious understanding, & to give an happy facility of communicating such knowledge to others. 
        Mayest thou, my beloved friend, be encouraged to prosecute thy studies in this school, & patiently & docibly [sic] go through the course allotted thee, that so every great & gracious design of Infinite Wisdom respecting thee may be fulfilled, the church may have the full benefit thereof of those services for which thou hast by a long train of sufferings been preparing, & thy own soul the full recompense of reward! This is my earnest wish for thee, & in this & every sentiment of true affection for thee my wife heartily joins. +++ Farewell, my dear friend
        Richard Shackleton
