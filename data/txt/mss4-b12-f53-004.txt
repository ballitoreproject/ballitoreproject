I seem much spent,
Ah my dear friend I hope
for our happy meeting in the
general Assembly of the first born &c. in a few more days
From Deborah Ferriss, to E W:
Wilmington 2nd of 5mo 1771
Dear friend,
Elizabeth Wilkinson,
These few lines comes with dear love to thee,
& husband & daughters, tho personally unknown to them, and
to acquaint thee with what will I make no doubt be affecting
to thee to hear of, respecting one thou so nearly regarded & had
such an uncommon affection for, & near sympathy with, as my
dear Brother Benjamin Ferriss, whom it hath pleased providence
to remove by death; it was his earnest desire that I

I would forward his letter to thee by the first opportunity
after his decease, & inform thee when he departed, which was
on the 17th day of 3 mo last, he kept his chamber four weeks,
and his bed but one day, he sat up more or less every day but
the one before he died, tho very much reduced in body; the last
two weeks of his time it was with difficulty he could speak
above a whisper, yet at some intervals he was favoured to give excellent
advise & counsel to many that came to see him, often saying
his work was done, & that he had nothing to do in the time
of his great weakness, but wait with patience untill it might
please providence in his adorable wisdom to remove him, he said
a few days before his decease that the joy and peace which he
felt flowed as a river, & added he would not have us be concern'd
about him, for he should be everlastingly happy. Oh our loss in
his removal is very great, yet we are sensible it is his everlasting
gain, and that he is entered into the mansions prepared
for the blessed, and is at rest and peace, He has left but
few equals behind him, (considering his years which was only
about 37) within the compass of my acquaintance. It is often
the secret language of my mind that it might please providence
to raise up more such as he was, that may stand

stand faithful for the cause of truth upon earth.
Time wont [insertion]at present[/insertion] admit of saying more, therefore I conclude
with dear love to thee and family, Thy loving and affectionate
friend,
Deborah Ferriss
