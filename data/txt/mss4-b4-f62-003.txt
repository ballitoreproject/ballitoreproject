Yesterday morning, Father, Mother, & sister Mary
all went for our monthly meeting, held this time at
Kilconner: - I feel to have a great charge left with
me, even our poor dear old Nanny, who weakens I
believe almost daily: I wish it best she may live till
their return: - she appears to be (as quietly as she can)
waiting the solemn close, I hope it will be a happy
one [underline]for her[/underline]. - You have your trouble there, too, - ah dear
cousin Joseph. - I wish [underline]thou[/underline] may not with [underline]over[/underline]
anxiousness injure thy own health, - thou gives
thy mind so to a thing [underline]when once thou begins[/underline]
my beloved sister Peggy, whom even to think of
I do think does me good, forget me not for I
am brought low I wish it might be a right bringing
down but there is so much of [underline]self[/underline] about
me that I fear I shall never be what I ought
to be. Thy remarks of how we [underline]ought[/underline] to do, are very
just I believe, but some of us are poor frail creatures,
& by no means enough on our guard: - if thou had
stopped before thou said the right manner was
my manner, it would have saved me some unpleasant
sensations, for alas! I [underline]know[/underline] it is not, & [underline]this[/underline]
[underline]proves[/underline], thou thinks much better of me than I deserve.
Sister Lydia is again settled at home wch.
is pleasant, for we look far from compleat without
her: - I fancy the sea-bathing agrees with Richard
I have a heavy cold in my head, - & beside want to
get the house cleaned before they come home: - Whenever
my dear sister can freely (& comfortably to herself) give
me a line, it will be wellcome to the heart of thy
Fifth-evening
