Sunniside 2nd Day 1 oClock 


My Dear Cousin


        from a hope that it will not shorten your visit at Sunniside we are glad to find James Abel and thyself find a willingness to attend our valuable Friends to Leek as also to attend that small Quarter Meeting. I am much obligd by thy willingness to take me with you if my way was opened in the right line - but apprehending that not to be the case at this time - believe thou will fully approve my declining it - and with a hope of having your company on your return remain thy poor but truly affectionate Cousin DDarby [DDarby is underlined in the document]


Dear Sally & Company in your absence would have been very acceptable to us, but as it is settled for her stay in such a kind house - can say nothing on the subject. Mother Darby & all her family write in Dear Love to Dear & J. Jurke [?] & E Hoyland - with yourselves & our Relations as if named


Deb: Darby
