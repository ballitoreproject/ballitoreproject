My dear James,
        +++ Alas ! our dearly beloved friend Edith Lovell, & our dear Joseph Sparrow - In thy letter, dated 29th ultimate thou says, "I had concluded to write thee this post to inform of my having for a season seen the last of dear Edith - she, Jo Sparrow & I went to Passage yesterday evening & slept on board the vessel that night - there we took an affectionate leave of each other about one o'clock to day, just getting under way when we parted, so that there is every appearance of her being restored to her family by the time this reaches thee - she was in good spirits, & seemed quite easy within." We little thought then that it was indeed the last which their friends were to see of them - that the Passage was to the ocean of eternity - & that the family, to which she was about to be restored, was the family & church of the first-born which are written in heaven. Such is the world in which we live: & so just are the words of the preacher, "All things come alike to all, there is one event to the righteous & to the wicked; to the good & to the clean, & to the unclean, to him that sacrificeth & to him that sacrificeth not." But he adds, "to him that is joined to all the living there is hope." The great difference lies here: "The wicked is driven away in his wickedness: but the righteous hath hope in his death."
