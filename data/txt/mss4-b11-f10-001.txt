Ballitore 27th of 2 mo. 1826
Edward Maguire
Had I known when last week
in Dublin that thy office was in Eustace street
I should have called to speak to thee respecting
the renewed deads thou hast in hands for William
Leadbeater as I wanted to know how near thy are
to completion, for on them depends the execution of
of others from him to me & from me to the person
who has purchased my interest & who is not to pay
the purchase money untill the completion of the
whole, so that thou wilt see it is material to
me that there be no unnecesary delay -
Please to excuse the liberty I thus taken
thy friend &
Thos Bewley
