From the same to the same

Dear Friend,
	I am much obliged by thy kind favour, & glad to hear so agreeable account of thy dear husbandI have a letter from Joseph Jacob, dated London 6th instant advising that Samuel Emlen [?] & another American friend were just arrived, but that thy husband had gone about 150 miles to a Quarterly meeting, & that it could not be exactly said when he would returnSo I believe it is necessary both for him & us to let Patience have its perfect work. Thou freely resignedest him to go: be resigned also to his stay. As it is hoped that he went in the Lords time it is to be hoped that he will return in the same. Perhaps at the fall of the year, if not sooner, we may see his face, & if Divine Goodness so please, see it with joy.
	We are through favour of Providence generally well here ++ Health is to be sure an invaluable blessing: but it seems meet to Infinite Wisdom when He tempers the cup of life with many sweets, to dash it with some alloy: this last is of various kinds, according to the different ends & purposes intended to be wrought in our different dispositions. Let us take the cup of life, as it is, thankfully at the hand of Him that has mixed it for us with many comforts, according to his kindness & mercy, & with some bitters also, according to his wisdom & justice. If the ingredients be all sanctified to us, the potion will prepare our spirits to participate of a cup without mixture in a [page number] 192 life to come, even the cup of eternal joy & gladness. This is the glorious prize at the end of this combat: the haven to which we steer, & where we shall happily arrive, if we only steadily & sincerely desire it, & permit the right steersman to guide the helm. ++++
	Joseph Jacob had not seen our ^dear^ friend Samuel Fothergill, but gives a very hopeless account as to any expectation of his recovery: however he had got greatly relieved from pain. Thus, dear friend, one after another retires from the field of labour, & the burden of the day devolved upon him a little remnant, whose knees as it were smite against one another through weakness, & who conscious of their many & great infirmities & inability of themselves, are often prostrated in humble & earnest supplication that they may be preserved, & influenced to live & act acceptably in the sight of their Creator, during the continuance of the short space of time which may be yet allotted to them, that so in their end, & at the end they may have Peace.
+++	I am, with true esteem, thy real friend
