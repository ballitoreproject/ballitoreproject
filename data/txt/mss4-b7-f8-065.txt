Garrett Green 2 March 1813
Dear Cousin
I was much gratified by the
joint favours I received the other day from
my old & steady friends. I shall avail myself
of my dear Mary's kind offer to write to the
Printers in London. I have not received any
account since the most favourable idea I can
form is that my little affair has been totally
neglected. I consider that half an hour would
be sufficient for a person qualified not only
to form an opinion of the merit of the production
but to make it his own - it is so simple
perhaps it might be necessary for longer time
to decide on the probability of its proving lucrative
or otherwise. I shall also accept with pleasure
of your good offices in Dublin. I write this day

to the Office of the Correspondent in consequence
of an Advertisement I saw yesterday for a Book-keeper
If you can make free with any acquaintance
to find out whether the situation would be suitable
for me - the duties & attendance required
Salary - character of principals line of business &c
I would consider it as a favour. I can not yet
determine when I shall go to Dublin - it is probable
I may go with the mail if so I can
only cast one longing look on the interesting
village - the theatre of my youthful pleasures
Believe me I was much concerned on being informed
of William's ailment - let the afflicted
parts be well wrapt up in new flannel - I
have by such an application been frequently
relieved from pains which I considered rheumatic
I think it only reasonable that I should pay
my own postage especially when I write on business
however I will not persevere as I can not save
you from expense on the reply Yours tr WR
