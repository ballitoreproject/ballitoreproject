Dear Friend
	
Since the short conference which we had last together I several times thought of writing to thee, but various necessary engagements much engross my time, & leave very little leisure for a correspondence with my friends. However, I thought I would just hint to thee in this way what might without premeditation occur upon the Subject of our last conversation. I am a person of universal good-will, & readily acknowledge that I am ^in^ a particular manner attached to the cause of my religious Profession: therefore I cannot, without some concern, observe any friend of mine publickly desert & disavow this same cause, which we have jointly professed. The only reason which thou gave me for discontinuing to frequent our religious assemblies, as far as I understand the reason, (viz. a private offence taken at some individual) is in itself so unreasonable, that I cannot but look on it as only some ostensible cause, while the true Reason lies deeper & in the secret labyrinths of the mind. Search there, Dear Friend, for the original cause, & I am mistaken if thou wilt not find it to be a disrelish for the limitations & Singularities which our profession requires; & a propensity to the grandeur the pleasures & the Vanities of the world which lies in Ignorance & Wickedness. But suffer me to expostulate with thee: from what really good & useful enjoyment does our profession debar us? Are we not allowed all the conveniences & satisfactions of Life, which the Almighty, beneficent Donor is pleased to favour us with? we are only restrained from the Excess & abuse ^of them^ (which are known to destroy the true relish) of them, & to preclude those sensations of humble gratitude to our great Benefactor which accompany a temperate, moderate use of his favours. And what will any of us get by joining in Spirit, in Covenant, in Familiarity with a deceitful, insincere world? In the first place, we do violence to that which is of God in our consciences: We reject & cast behind our backs the many visitations, wooings & invitations which have been various ways repeatedly & graciously offered: We tacitly, by our contrasted Conduct reproach our ancestors, who lived & died in the Faith, as Deceivers & Deceived; or else we bring reproach on ourselves whose lives are diametrically opposite to theirs. We greatly endanger our property & our morals by an intimate connection with those who are not restrained by the fears of their Creator from running headlong into various vices, & whose pleasure & profit it is to allure others that are in affluent circumstances into the same Excess of Riot (which often ends in the same distress & embarrassment) with themselves. By renouncing our religious profession & forsaking our communion, we abandon that which is Truth, & either adopt, that which is Error in its stead: or else joining from principle with no-religious society, we become ensamples ^of^ irreligion, & settle in a profane course of Life injurious to our own peace, displeasing to God, & offensive to wise, considerate men. Bear with me, Dear Friend, tis possibly the last time I may trouble thee on this head. Thou art the Father of a pretty numerous flock of Children, thou art the Successor of religious ancestors, thou art come into their place & some of their possessions. If thou woud walk worthily & acceptably before thy great benefactor, who sees all thy secret thoughts, as well as marks thy words & actions, & will assuredly reward according to our works; it is (in my sense) highly necessary for thee to come down in thy mind, & in humility & sincerity seek for Divine Wisdom & strength, that thou may be preserved safe through this dangerous & uncertain state of Existence; that thou may fill up the Station, in which All-wise Providence has placed thee, with Rectitude & Propriety, as a man & a Christian & that thou may discharge that Ponderous duty of a parent to thy offspring, in such a manner as well redound to thy own solid, Peace & their substantial Good: that so, when that awful period shall arrive (& how near it may be at hand is quite uncertain) when Inquisition will be made into our lives & Conduct, whether we have ^walked in the fear of our Creator, whether we have^ properly & gratefully received his favours & benefits, as using & not abusing them, & whether we have stood uprightly & faithfully in our lots, spreading & enforcing the genuine principles & spirit of Christianity by our lives & conversations, & fulfilling every relative duty appertaining to our station; that at that solemn time, & before that tremendous Judge, Witness & Benefactor, thou may have to give up thy accounts with joy & not with grief. That this may be thy happy experience in the sincere desire of

Thy affectionate friend
Richard Shackleton
