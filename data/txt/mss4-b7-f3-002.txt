Dear Molly
As we don't recollect anything about a watch of
A: Sparks's, & I could not find thee out, when coming from
Edenderry, to enquire, I now take the pen to request information
respecting it ~ where, or when, or how we got it, or were
to get it, & what to do with it ~ If there was any thing
for either of us to do in it, thy mentioning [underline]what[/underline] may perhaps
revive it in our remembrance.
We would like to hear of your getting well home &c, &
who of the Friends went forward on the National Visit, whether
the same as before, or any staid in this Province & other went
along ~ We have bemoaned having heavy Rain, on their, as
well as other accounts ~ had fine weather for our return
got safe home about ten o'clock second day morning & found
things apparently well ~ for all which I wish to be duly thankful
~ Our Cousin Christian Hutchinson Junr. departed this
life about the middle of the preceding night ~ they propose
interring her [insertion]at[/insertion]
