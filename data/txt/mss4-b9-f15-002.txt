30 Aungier - street 12th Month 18th 1817
Dear Sarah
As I have so many other correspondents
in Ballitore, I thought thou would have
no objection [deletion]if I should[/deletion] to my [deletion]making tho[/deletion] adding
thee to the number, although unasked. To thy company
I am indebted for many a pleasant hour, &
may I take the liberty of [deletion]as[/Deletion] begging of thee to contribute
in another manner to my enjoyments, by becoming
one of my correspondents.
I like my lodgings very well, but not quite so
well since my old schoolfellow Winthrop Blood left
them, which he did a few weeks ago, to live with
his brother. I sometimes meet him in the streets,
he is just the same curious sort of fellow that ever
he was. I visited the deaf and dumb school since
I came to town, but did not stay there long enough
to satisfy my curiosity or to say much of what I
thought of it. I intend to visit it again when Doctor
Aspen returns. There have been some very interesting
letters from him & Richard lately. What they

write makes me think more favourably of [deletion]Eng[/deletion] this kingdom
than I have hitherto done; & [deletion]should not{deletion [insertion]I think[/insertion] the
great superiority which it possesses over the other countries
of Europe should not only make those who are
sensible of it, love their country more, but should also
make them grateful for the blessing of being born in
it. & should incite them to take advantage of such
a privilege.
I suppose thou hast heard that I have been admitted
as a member of the [insertion]weekly[/insertion] reading party. We call ourselves
the Quaternion. We are now reading the third volume
of Gibbon, after which, we have a [underline]dessert[/underline] of
Lalla bookh or some other poem, which sets Edward
& Joseph into fits of enthusiasm & me into fits
of laughing at them. Thank thy mother & Lydia for
their letters which were both very acceptable, & tell
the latter that as well as I can calculate I will
write my next letter to her on the 5th of 2nd month 1818.
& tell Mary Shackleton that I intend to write to her
on the 15th of next month. May I request of thee
permission to get a copy of thy profile from Alexander
Bewley, & may I also request for thee permission for
Eliza Gough & me to read thy poem,[insertion] in the possession of [/insertion] Joseph Fayle.
on a pig's tail, which he would not allow, without
thy leave. He & I sometimes walk on a fine

morning.
Thou must know that I am now member of the Medical
Society of Dublin, having been unanimously elected
last seventh day.
Edward Carrole & his wife arrived here last second
Edward Carroll & his wife arrived here last second
day. & they [deletion]both[/deletion] gave us each a sermon in meeting,
last third day. They have not yet left us. Joseph
Fayle & I went to the theatre on third-day night.
We got seats in the pit, & were highly entertained.
Allow me to present thee with [insertion]a late edition of[/insertion] the works of our
mutual favorite poet, which I send with this letter
Ellen Grubb sends her dear love to thy mother, & is doing
well as to thee & all Ballitore.
& remain in hopes of a reply,
Thy ever affectionate friend
Thomas Fisher
19 th Please to tell Lydia with my love, that I am much
obliged to her for the high compliment (for so I consider
it ) which she pays me in requesting me to write to her
every week; but that although it would be [insertion] very [/insertion] gratifying to me
to hear from her so often, yet I could not comply with
it, without doing injustice to my other correspondents, &
I am sure she would not wish me to make such a
sacrifice on that account - Farewell.
