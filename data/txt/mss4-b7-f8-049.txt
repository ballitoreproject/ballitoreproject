Waterford, Seventhmonth 5th 1799
My dear Cousin
A daughter of Murtough Whelan was kind
enough to call on me informing me of her intention
to set out homeward early to-morrow I embrace
the opportunity of letting thee know we are thro'
mercy tolerably well. I was well pleased at thy
introduction of thy little cherubs to my acquaintance
the qualifications of my little urchin could be seen
summed up. however must defer it to a future
opportunity. If Cousin TChandlee would be kind
enough to inform me what prospect there is of
recovering the late Geo Dakers debt to my employers
for [unclear]as ask[/unclear] of bil I would be obliged as
if it should prove a desperate one they might
acquaint the proprietor of the bil in England &
consequently not be sufferers themselves as they
must

must be if silent on the subject much longer or
at least expose themselves to a dispute or censure.
I some time since saw an advertisement of some
production or compilation of Cousin Abm. if any
opportunity should offer I should be glad to have
whatever he presented to the world in that way as
from his experience it must be serviciable to youth.
Poor Peggy Rogers has been deprived of her little
sufferer & is now in the height of her trouble
yester even it was consigned to the grave
Joined by my wife I request my affectionate
salutations to you all - Farewell
thine sincerely
William Rayner
