" What hinders you from disgarding this troublesome scrupulosity
of yours which stands so grievously in your way? If it be a small thing to
enjoy a beauttiful mind, sound at the very core, that does not shrink from
the keenest insepction, inward freedom from remorse and perturbation; unsullied
whiteness and simplicity of manners, a genuine integrity
"Pure in the last recesses of the mind"
if you think these advantages are inadequate recompence for what you resign,
dismiss your scruples this instant, and be a slave merchant, a parasite -
or - what you please;
If these be motives weak, break off betimes'
and as you have not spirit to assert the dignity of virtue, be wise
enough not to forego the emoluments of vice.
I much admire the spirit of the antient philosophers, in that they never
attempted, as our moralists often do, to lower the tone of philosophy,
and make it consistent with all the indulgences of indolence and
sensuality. They never thought of having the bulk of mankind for their
disciples; but kept themselves as distant as possible from a worldly
life. They plainly told men what sacrifices were required, and what advantages
they were which might be expected.

Hoc age deliciis . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . '
If you would be a philosopher these are the terms. You must do thus
and thus: there is no other way. If not, go and be one of the vulgar.
There is no one quality gives so much dignity to a character, as consistency
of conduct. Even if a mans pursuits be wrong and unjustifiable, yet if
they are prosecuted with steadiness and vigour, we cannot withhold our
admiration. The most characteristic mark of a great mind is to
choose some one important object, and pursue it through life.
It was this made Caesar a great man. His object was ambition;
he pursued it steadily, and was always ready to sacrifice
to it every interfering passion or inclination.
"There is a pretty passage in one of Lucian's dialogues, where Jupiter
complains to Cupid that tho' he has had so many intrigues, he
was never sincerely beloved. In order to be loved, says Cupid, you
must lay aside your aegis and your thunder-bolts, and you must
curl and perfume your hair, and place a garland on your
head, and walk with a soft step, and assume a winning,
obsequious deportment. But, replied Jupiter, I am not willing
to resign so much of my dignity. Then, returns Cupid, leave off
desiring to be loved: - He wanted to be Jupiter & Adonis at the
same time "It must be confessed, that men of genius are
of all others most inclined to make these unreasonable claims.
As their relish for enjoyment is strong, their views large and
comprehensive, they feel themselves lifted above the common
bulk of mankind, they are apt to slight that natural reward
of praise and admiration which is ever largely paid to
distinguished abilities; and to expect to be called forth to public
notice and favour: without considering that their talents are

"We usually say - that man is a genius, [underline]but[/underline] he has

to the freer commerce that different ranks and professions now
enjoy with each other, that characters are not marked with
sufficient strength: the several classes run too much into
one another. We have fewer pedants, it is true, but we have
fewer striking originals. Every one is expected to have such
a tincture of general knowledge as is incompatible with
going deep into any Science; and such a conformity [deletion]of[/deletion]

My dear S. I herewith send you the remainder, of what you are
pleased to call " good sound stuff" and expression certainly deeply in
character with a chandler wife and [insertion]in[/insertion] some respects not misapplied. I
copied it for you, allow me to say, because I thought it not respectible
to the [unclear]habit[/unclear] of thinking which you and perhaps both of us have
fallen into lately. I hope you will find less difficulty in reading it than
you have often done my writing and that you will not be
deterred from a second perusal. For Wm [unclear]Barlands[/unclear] essay
on "the Inconsistency of our Expectations," I received your

your letter by hand just now, and rejoice to hear you are
getting stronger. Persevere in the plan you have adopted.
You express a wish to see me, by which if you mean
[deletion]that [unclear][/unclear] [/deletion] that I should go down and return without
you; I will do it provided you repeat your wish and
say that it will anyway conduce to your improvement
either in Mind or body. Otherwise I believe I shall
wait till you are ready to return with me.
I do wish to see as well as hear how you are but
to go down and return without you is what I am not
prepared for till you urge me more; yet I do
not say this because I am at all dissatisfied at
your staying as long as you continue to receive
any benefit from the air and exercise of Ballitore. I
have seen the children at the Glen this day, they are excellent well
My Mother desires me to say to you that they are very little
trouble, and that any they do cause is compensated by
the pleasure of having them with her. [unclear]MD[/unclear] Beatty has appointed
Tuesday next to execute leases, a matter which I should not
like to put off unless you desire me. Perhaps were I to go
Dont forget my dear love to your mother
to Ballitore on Wednesday or Thursday next that you
could be able to return with me on Sunday
or Monday following I shall make enquiry
