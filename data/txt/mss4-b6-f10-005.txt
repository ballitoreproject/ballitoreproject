& progress of the disorder - his acct. not
more unfavourable than heretofore, shall
we indulge a hope, my Dear friend of

once highly favoured Society is awfully
alarming - adieu My Dear Molly - I love
thee dearly for thy own & thy fathers
sake - several frds Sarah Harrison &c

Dear E - Lest thou should have been
alarmed by its "immediately," letter - I will say
that it contained no unfavourable tidings. Sally
was rather better & they intend to sail at one tomorrow
