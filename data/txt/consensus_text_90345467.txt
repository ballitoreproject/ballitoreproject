everything and everybody very accomodating.
After dinner we took a stroll about
the place [unclear][/unclear] admired the lovely view
[insertion]from the bridge[/insertion] of the river and glistening trees all
lighted up as they were by the evening
sun and returned just in time to
drive off for the ten minutes to sight
train leaving spent a very pleasant
day indeed, thanks to Papa to whom
we owe all the pleasure. We were
welcomed home by a very acceptable
cup of that beverage that cheers but not
inebriates and were agreeably surprised
19 Sunday - A wet morning, but as
it cleared after breakfast Papa thought
we might as well go to meeting, so off
we young people went. After meeting

surprised to meet Uncle and Aunt Cole
who were coming out to spend the day
there. No company to day which
was rather pleasant it it was
Polly and Thomas's last day out here
