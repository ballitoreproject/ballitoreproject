My Dear Cousin
The sympathy I have felt with thee on account
of thy fine little girl's illness, (knowing that it is to feel pangs
of that sort) has prompted me to send thee a few lines, to let
thee know that we remember thee under this afflicting trial.
I very much desire that thou may be enabled to bear it, with
a degree of resignation to the will of him who has hitherto
helped, & who can bring thro' the seventh trouble [deletion]&[/deletion] [insertion]as[/insertion] well as the
six: he knows that thy heart is sincere, & that thou desires
above all things to be acceptable to him, & while it continues
to be so with thee, he will not leave nor forsake thee; &
tho' he shou'd try thee by depriving thee of what he has lent
for a while, it may be all for the best, tho' for the present
not Joyous but grievous, as his wisdom is unsearchable
& his ways past finding out: this true resignation is what
my humble petition is often for, well knowing that this life
is short, & that every stage of it has it's temptations, & for my
Self & for my poor children are my desires fervent that we
might be preserved from falling of one side or the other.
my recent trial of losing my Dear Sister has been felt
deeply by us, but time wears off the edge of such things.
knowing that it will soon be over with ourselves, & the consideration
of the situation she might have been in if we had left her

her behind us, has greatly alleviated my trouble; & the
doing what we cou'd for her while living to make her life
comfortable, makes it easier to me & my Dear husband,
who behaved with the affection of an own Brother to her.
Our poor little John has been at Athy sometime past
& we hear frequently that he is recruiting, (which I suppose
thou hears from thy affectionate sister) but it was thought
best that he shou'd stay with her till after the meeting.
I am in haste, the post near going out, so must conclude
with all our Dear love to thee & all the family, wishing
thee the best consolation & succour, I am thy truely
affectionate & sympathizing frd. & cousin
