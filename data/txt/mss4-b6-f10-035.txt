Dear friend
I have rec'd thy favor [unclear]last[/unclear],
in consequence made abt. prices of flax &
wool the former of good quality at Jona.
Haughttons 16d per lb - but I think pretty
good fit for two dozn. yarn can be got
in our market from 13 to 14 pence
per lb and skein wool at 30s/ per sk 16lb
if these prices will answer advise
soon & the quanty wanted & I will
endeavour to execute the order on the
best terms I can -
Our son James's leg is still much
contracted & painful - he has got downstairs
a few days - and I hope my wife
may return home in one of the coaches
or a post chaise on the 2nd day next, tell
our Edward to be on the watch as I
know he woud be glad to see her
I expect a letter in the morning

when I may add more particulars
I know not how you liked the American
preacher in Ballitore some of us here
I mean those who have taken the liberty
of thinking for themselves were
much disgusted with some of exploaded
doctrine wch. he utterd viz that we were
all born children of wrath with other
incredible doctrines respecting the Jewish
wars the murdering of Agag, & the Slaying
the first born of the Egytians before
the promisd seed coud be liberated &c &c
My private opinion is that the poor
man knew nothing of master as he ought
to know - and [insertion]had[/insertion] much better have staid
at home & minded his farm than to come
3,000 miles to promulgate such ungodlike
& [insertion]abhorrent[/insertion] incredible doctrine - I requested
John Pim to reprove him for it
but doubt whether his orthodoxy will
allow him to do so. I woud have
done it myself had he fallen in my way
Conclude with Dear love to thee Sister
Sally &c &c Thy Affectionate friend
