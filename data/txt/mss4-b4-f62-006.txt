It is no unpleasing task to me to be desired to converse
with my beloved sister Grubb, who is indeed very
near & dear to my heart: tho' writing much seems unnessasary
when the scribes are at home, & to hear of
each other sometimes satisfies. My mother is of her
better fashon in health I think, is about to go on her
car to visit our invalids &c, has desired me to write
thee, & say that she is much obliged by thy last, which
she esteems valuable, takes it particularly kind that
thou does not look for a return from [underline]her[/underline], as she is so
hard set to write: - the query thou desires we seem
incapable of informing thee about, my mother thinks
the clerk Sally Grubb John is the likely one to know
most about it: mother was so poorly, & her mind other
ways engaged during the sittings of those meetings,
that she did not gather all the transactions of them,
she thought it proper to visit a few families in Co: Wicklow
amongst whom was some difference, & therefore
several joining her, they proformed their visit, as thou
may have heard. I suppose before now thou hast
heard from brother Saml. we have had two letters from
London, the first dated the 30th of last month, the last
the 2d of this: - in first letter [deletion]he[/deletion] [insertion]father[/insertion] says, they got to John
Eliot's about 7 o'clock on fifth-day P:M; - "James Thornton lodges
"with us - next morning John de Marcillac (who had come
"to the meeting) breakfasted with us - a pleasing, free, solid
"spirited man I think. Sam & I are bed-fellows, having
"excellent accommodation, & been cordially received. Since
"writing the foregoing I have been at the yearly meeting of
"ministers & Elders (the first sitting): which was as to myself
"satisfactory in a good measure." So much the first letter,
now for the last - "I dined yesterday at Wilson Birkbeck's,
"in company with John de Marcillac, Anne Summerland, Esther
"Tuke, R & S Grubb, &c: after dinner Anne Summerland appeared
1789

"in supplication, several short testimonies I think followed
"& afterwards the young thing Esther's daughter Anne came
"forth in supplication with much liveliness & brightness - she
"promises fair, if merciful preservation be afforded to become
"an instrument of Good. John Eliot was chosen clerk,
"much against his inclination. - We have now had two outings,
"& are getting (I fear) too much into the land of debate -
nevertheless, Good is near – Ide M: got permission to sit the
"meetings of discipline, as he came over to seek improvement
"in the religious line - he seems very sensible, very attentive,
"& reckons that he mostly understands what is delivered.
" - May our children be preserved with that eye open, which
"hath seen, & does see the beauty & excellence of the precious
"Truth - may it continue to hold the chief seat, the uppermost
"room in their hearts - & whatever they or we may be deprived
"of, may we never be so unhappy as to be deprived
"of divine favour, & merciful protection–John Pemberton's
"dear love to you all–Sam Grubb's love–we keep much together
" - he seems greatly pleased with his excursion. - M Watson
"appeared very lively I think in the select meeting yesterday -
"Ireland is not like to see James Thornton - he proposes returning
"home soon from hence - he is an able minister &
"stout man. - John Pemberton's case is to come on - he is not
"free to return home." Perhaps thou hast heard all this
before, if so it will not be so interesting to thee, but it
will show [underline]our[/underline] good intention. Joss Haughton reckons
himself better, gets to walk out of doors a little again, but
looks very ill & is [underline]not[/underline] likely to recover. Our dear H: Haughton
is poorly this some time with a heavy cold: - he brother
John I believe tolerably, yet still has a cough & does
not look stout. Abby Widdows able to walk about the
Village, & talk of Clonmel, but when she will get to go I
know not. Last second-day afternoon Abram & I took
a ride to Athy, & were at an appoint'd meeting there (5 o'clock
in the evening) with dear M: Ridgway, & J: Watson:
they

they were on their way to Waterford, from thence to
Cork, where I suppose the wait for a ship: - dear Mary
took a right sort of a leave of some of us in brother
Chandlee's parlour: - we shall sorely miss her company.
Sister Lydia means I believe to set out in her chair
for Wicklow meeting next sixth-day, & has kindly
offered to take me with her: - it looks rather dull
for my mother with no [insertion]parlour[/insertion] companion but Nanny, & was
it not to a meeting I think I would not go, but she
seems to think if a tolerable state of health be permitted
her she may do. Sister Mary I expect will
return soon, I think her visit has been pretty long
[underline]for Dublin.[/underline] Our little Margaret still looks very thin
but it is generly thought is gaining ground. I believe
& mother are determined to get her to
most [unclear]illegible[/unclear] & mother are determined to get her to
the saltwater this season, but are as yet undetermined
as to the place. Thy Abram & Richard took
tea with us yesterday evening, they looked well & seemed
in very good spirits. Sister Chandlee paid us a
little visit lately, & I believe intends to come soon
again & get Abram & Richard home with her for a
little while: - her children at present bravely. How
goes on dear Betsy Tuke with her arduous care? And
my very dear friend Mary Dudley, whomed hope thou
often gets to. I have been thinking that perhaps at
our next quarterly meeting we may be feasted with
a sight of thee: - has not John got suck enough? On
asking Nanny if she had commands to thee, she says
she has a deal, love in plenty & wishes to see thee.
Had thou satisfaction of dear Saml. Neale? I quite
long for his company once more, had little of any
of it in Dublin: Oh it was a dismal time, beginning &
ending. My dear sister Margaret affectionately farewell.

My Dr. Peggy I am come back, & think Sally has wrote thee a brave letter, & saved
my poor eyes, Jos: Haughton very weakly & says he does not expect ever to be the
same man as he has been, he & poor Molly desire their love to thee, & take kind thy
remembering [insertion]of[/insertion] them; I read to him what thou wrote concerning him; I have often
since his illness strove to remind him of the great change, & perhaps the time
being mercifully lenthened out may be a means of his being more sinsible of
his condition. Poor Hannah Haughton seems very poorly with a heavy
cold. With Dr. love to thee & children I am thy obliged & affect. mother
