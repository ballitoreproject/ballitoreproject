My dear E
I am very much obliged for
the eggs, I assure thee I did
not mean to beg them when I
ask'd thee to get them for me
I shall return the basket by the
women as I do not like to trouble
Debby with it, I hope Tommy may
do well at the school, - that was
a long catalogue of dutts
thou sent me poor Becky
will be miss'd - I wish thou
would send for my nurse's
daughter in law & her child & say
what thou thinks of them &
whether she would answer

M [unclear]Clayton[/unclear] - how is my mother
is her book completed yet?
I have a most wretched pen
& have no comfort in writing
with it
thy SB
