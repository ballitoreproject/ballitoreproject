Extract from Wm. Law. Taken from the
Monthly Review.
I am not against our using all the arguments
that reason & learning can furnish
us with, in the defence of religion; but
I think we are much mistaken, when we
place our chief strength there, & conclude
that christianity must prosper, or infidelity
decline, according [deletion]to[/deletion] [insertion]as[/insertion] all objections & difficulties
are more or less cleared up & solved. For
as Religion never entered into the fallen world
that way, by condescending to explain all the
difficulties, or answer all the objections that
ignorance, malice, self love, pride, curiosity,
wit, or worldly learning could bring against
it; as no revelation from God ever dealt in
this manner, with this kind of adversaries
so it is against reason to think, that it must
now, or at any other time, be supported in that
manner. For these tempers have no right or
claim to be answered or satisfied in their own
way

way; as they are only so many disorders or
corruptions of the soul[deletion]s[/deletion], so they are to have
no relief from religion, but that of dying
before it - As to the relief which is sought
for in such discoveries, humility, faith &
resignation make it needless, & give the
mind a comfort & rest in God, which cannot
be equalled by any such speculative
light: for my own part, this one saying
"Shall not the judge of [insertion]all[/insertion] the world do right"
is more to me, is a stronger support to my
mind, & a better guard against all anxiety,
than the deepest discoveries that the most
speculative inquisitive minds could help
me to.
