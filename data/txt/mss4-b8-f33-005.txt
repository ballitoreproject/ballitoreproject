by Samuel the 27-11-9 it will oblige as I am
just now in want of a little money - and
say will it be convinient to thee to accept
one or two bills in favor of my son Ben:
in [underline] 3 [/underline] or in 3 & [underline]Six[/underline] months allowing Inst:
from this time
We are all favd. wth. health & pretty good
Spirits - but apprehend the seperation of our
Dr Ben in the evening will cause a very
great chasm - this is the first grand
epocha of his life - my heart is full I cannot
enlarge dear love to Molly & the children
