My dear Elizth.. Lydia paid us but a short visit, she left
us & Jas this morning & sail'd 'd with E & D, we
went along with them to Howth & saw them
leave the shore & I felt very lonely & sorry
when I saw the vessel sail away Deborah
is much better [insertion]within these last few days[/insertion] than she was I think she look'd
even smaller & hope she will be much better
for the trip did you not wonder at Lydia's
going? I had fed myself with the pleasure
of thinking I would have had her in Deb's absence
they propose staying some days, but I suppose
you will hear from them as soon as we shall
I did not tell nurse that her child was ill, Mag.
is much better of the eruption I'm inclined to think
she had not the itch, she takes great notice
thou wilt be delighted to see her, thy own little child
there came by the carman a crock of butter in
a basket, I do not know who it was for or
who sent it the butter was safe but the
crock was broken, I have [insertion]2[/insertion] baskets belonging
to Ballitore, the hamper went from under [unclear][/unclear]
belonging to Deborah, I do not know whether I paid
for the iron pot or not please say in thy next
Susan Doyle spoke to me about getting Sophia
Butler to go as childs maid to a patient of hers
in Naas a clergymans wife she would
have to take care of the child & would have
one to wait on herself SD does not know
how long she might be wanted perhaps

a few months, please say whether Sophia be a
Protestant & whether she would like such
a situation if she were to get it -
Edw has just left us for the Glen so
thou may think how lonely I feel
with dear love to all I remain thy affect. SB
Do not send any more assparragas as
Deb is not here to eat it
