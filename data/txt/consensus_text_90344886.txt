offered to come up, so then
we are expecting them, I hope
they will stay till after dinner,
This evening as we [underline]had[/underline]
the horses, Ned, polly, and
I took a fine long ride,
all the way to Delgany which
looked very pretty this beautiful
evening, the poor horses
I think, were tired to judge
from the heat they were in
Ned was on Philip's mare
Polly on Charlie's which is now
out here, and my honourable
siff on the everlasting little
horse. It was very pleasant,
now that I remember
it was just this time two
years that Willie was out
here, and then also the
three of us used to go riding
together. alas! alas! all that has
happened since -
