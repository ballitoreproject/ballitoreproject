My Dear Friend
I had a promise from my Dear M Leadbeater
before I left home [insertion]of a letter[/insertion] but here is almost three months
pass'd & no one from her tho I long much to hear how she is
And whether she is got safe over that painful trying time
she had to pass thro indeed my beloved friend I love thee
so well that I cant put of any longer enquiring after thee
I know that trials await us all & some meet with more
than others, & some are better fitted to bear them than others
but kind Providence as he is eyed & sought too in all our
Steppings along fits the back to bear the burdens that
falls to their lots, I know some looks with an eye one way
and some another but no one feels the pinching of the shoe
like those that wear it, & it is not always new shoes sits
easy at first, no more than new ways pointed out, that
we might do this that or the other, I know not that it is
the case neither do I know how I came to set down such
things but thou knows paper will take any thing that is
put on it I have in my small measure often sympathizd
With you believing that you meet with your tossings
and provings, I believe many ways some the world knows

and some perhaps the world knows not off but oh
the favour that he knows that knows the secret
of all hearts & from whom nothing can be hid
and I believe as faith & patience is lived in and
abode Under all things will work together for
good to those that love & fear his great name &
as you my Beloved friends are I believe of that
number that knows his name to be as precious ointment
& therefore the Virgin souls love him trust in
him & way will be made where we can se no ways because
he still remains to be as the shaddow of mighty
Rock in a weary land, are you not at times weary
and almost wearied out in looking at one thing and
beholding another and knows not where to fix or
at times what to fix upon this I know to be [deletion]a[/deletion] trying
but he that has all power in his own holy hand
can still make hard things easy & sweeten the bitter
cups that may be handed to us & in his own due &
appointed time enable us to lift up our heads in
hope believing the time of our Deliverance is at
hand, I mean a deliverance from things that has

taken up too much of our times & attention that ought to be fixt
on him that is the durable substance & I believe it wou'd fare better
with many if they cast their care on him who is I verily believe
careing for his own let their states & situations in this life be
what they may my mind whilest I am thus writing seems dipt into
a feeling sympathy with you & the reason I am a stranger too but
true love begets sympathy & a fellow feeling tho ever so remote
Oh the preciousness of this love how it visits over sea & land, I cou'd
[insertion]write[/insertion] more but am loath tho I remember thou art under a promise not to
expose my worthless scrawls & I know this is not worth the postage
but I cant well help it - I rejoice in the hearing of Dr Saml. Elly having
open'd his mouth in publick I wish him well on his way this information
I had from J Pim of London
we have been here too weeks next seventhday & that day we intend
leaving this to turn our faces towards Dorsetshire direct to me Thos.
Thompson Compton near Sherbourne in said Country our very Dear loves
to thy Brother & sister Chanly thy Mother thy sister Sally Brother & his
family & expect thee & thy Wm. will accept your portion from thy sincere
what has Debby got to let us hear
& mention any little occurrance
