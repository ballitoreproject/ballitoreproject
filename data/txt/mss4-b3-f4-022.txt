Clonmel 18th of 8th month 1788

My dear Uncle

	A frank being sent me just at bed & time to convey a letter from our dear mother to thee I am unwilling to dismiss it without telling thee with my own ^and^ that ^thro^ continued gracious kindness my husband M Dudley & self are again restored to our new, comfortable tho rather unfinished habitation  tis now too late every way to give thee such a detail of our peregrinations as thy affectionate fatherly solicitude about demands  Thou woudst [sic] probably hear by some means of our landing at Brighthelmstone from Dieppe having parted dear G. & S.D. at Alencon who returned to England by way of Jersey & Guernsey accompanied by JD. Marcillae [?] who left them on the last island in much love  know then further that we spent two weeks in London the latter of which was a time of great indisposition to dear M.D. as was many other weeks in our journey but she recruited as usual with travelling
We took the journey leisurely to Milford taking much the same road that thou & we came last summer except that we called at Amersham instead of Jordans [?], left our road a little to visit Cirencester & Painswick & visited ^took most of^ the few meetings in south Wales  we embarked at Hubberstone last 4th day evening & landed at Cheakpoint on 6th day afternoon having a very stormy passage & we all a very sick company our two new sailers particularly so fiz sister Eliza Tuke & Sarah Alexander of Rochester a young woman who is to serve us in house business
R. Dudley met us at Cheakpoint to mutual joy, on 7th day it was greatly added to by our arrival at Clonmel & on 1st it was fully because the masters ^presence^ was with us & anima [missing words/letters in following due to paper folded] the instrument of five (not of ten) strings to make mention of his name  on instrument I humbly trust it may be called for we being many a made ^one^ through the precious cementing influence of the one spirit  my heart rejoices in the account received of thy & our beloved S Shackleton to whom is the salutes of my endear affection & sisterly sympathy  we all hope you will spare her to us a while soon

This day was our monthly meeting  we poor but (I trust thro unmeritted kindness peaceful travellers gave it some account of our feeble endeavours for the promotion of the great cause by which we seem each on our return to have got incorporated in the visible body  we dined at Bro Sa & feasted on sister Margarets company ten Sarah John & our amiable C.P. being with us but I ought to tell thee that the latter said a few words sweetly in supplication in the womens meeting & yet I have scarcely time to say that I am thine & all your affectionate S. R. Grubb
PS Do forgive us like thyself for not writing ^thee^ whilst we were away especially dear M.D. for I am witness to her intention my husband sister ^ A Broadhead desire dear love
