My dear much loved friend
I am just holed in the Inn at Carlow yr past
one oclock. I have borne the journey so far
much better than I had anticipated, we have not
quite resolved how to proceed. my inclination
points to our leaving this place in the afternoon
for Kilnock allowing my husband time to spend
a necessary time [deletion ]and[/deletion] at the school, and after
resting there tomorrow, proceed slowly to
[unclear][/unclear] Mills - the man waits most dearly

though. I had some dread of
the breakings, my J.B.C thought

I have written to my dear Mother
excuse my [unclear][/unclear]. I hope to
excuse my enlarging. I hope to
write from [unclear][/unclear] Wells I am in
dearest love to each of my truly kind
farewell thy
obliged & trusty
affectionate
