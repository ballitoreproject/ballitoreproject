P. S. Excuse both totology and [unclear]scrale[/unclear] of my letter, as I am a
good deal hurried at present: if you will favour me with
a letter I shall take it very kind; and please direct to me at
Daly's Coffe house; as I am not acquainted with any change
that may have happened in your family; please to give my
respects to Wm Shackleton; and all your family that are
with you.
