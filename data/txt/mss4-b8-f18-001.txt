Mt. Melick 6th mo 2nd 1794
Dear Wm.
Thy brother John shewed me a letter wherein he
pointed out a part wherein thou wished me to advance him 3Â£.
odd on thy account, this I rather thought strange of and thought
when I spoke to thee on the subject in Dublin thou told me thou
had taken up a good resolution, and intended not to be so lavish in future,
however I concluded if thou really wished I should advance
it to him thou wd. have wrote to myself, yet wonder thou canst be
so prodigal of thy property, nevertheless if thou desires it I intend
to advance him the money on thy account.
Please remember me affectionately to thy Mother, Sister
Sally, Abraham & Lydia, and with Love to thyself & thy Mary I
remain. thy friend. W...Beale
