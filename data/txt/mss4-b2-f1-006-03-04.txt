        I enter my grand Climacterick this day.


My dear James
        ++ I know that simple faithfulness & obedience to the manifestations of duty is all any of us have for it - ^[pencil note] X^ the injunction which holds good to all generations, is, ye shall therefore keep my statutes & my judgments: which if a man do, [page number] 218 he shall live in them - And without this faithfulness & obedience we may be compassing a mountain all our life long, & die in the wilderness at last - But I am persuaded that this is not the gracious will & design of heaven respecting his visited family - but that the members of it being fed & clothed by the Great Master should honestly and diligently perform their work assigned to them, & so have their meal in due season, & grow strong for labour in the business of the day, not murmuring, nor repining, nor fretting; but humbly & gratefully receiving, & willingly & cheerfully imparting according to divine direction.
