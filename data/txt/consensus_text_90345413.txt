13. Went to meeting with Papa and
Ned - A discussion to day about
the alteration of the meeting hours.
called at Glendruid.
Erasmus came out to tea having
spent most of the day with a school
fellow of his.
14 Monday. Charlie and Philip
went on a shooting excursion and
a lovely day they had for it. Papa
to town as usual. I took a delightful
ride to Big Sugar loaf, and thought
I scarcely ever saw the mountains look
prettier.
15 Tuesday- Another charming day
and another pleasant end for I was
wilder than yesterday. Got an
invitation to a party at Susan Perry's.
Philip came home this evening.
Charlie went on to town- little or
no sport- only a wild duck, grey ploom,
pair of snipe and something else-
which I forget.
