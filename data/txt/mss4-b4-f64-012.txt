Balliton 9 mo. 29th 1808
My Dear Sister/
Having a letter I suppose from Mary Dickenson
to enclose, & a little leisure, I encline to converse with thee, tho' I do
feel very stupid & have nothing New to communicate; The kindness of
our freinds, & Margaret being so immediately under thy wing, makes me
quite easy; our beloved travelers I suppose have ere now given thee a warm
embrace, I long to take them in my arms, & expect to be soon gratified, as
I do not think, even their Dublin friends can keep them much longer from
us - Elizabeth is a great help & comfort to me, We had Marg Pike
last evening, thou knows how I feel towards her - but I want to tell thee
about Anna Russel, a fine Girl that Abram saw at Ballicaly &
its most likely invite her to call to see him at Ballitore; last 7th day
sto[insertion]p[/insertion]ping at the Inn, she inquir'd & was told who liv'd here, came down
asked for Abram, he was with his Men, I had gone to see Lydia [unclear]MLS[/unclear]
Elizabeth in her pretty modest way press'd her to come in; but she enclined
to walk round the Town, Sarah Medlicoat & me met her, & had we known
who she was, we shou'd have had pleasure in paying her those attentions
which on every account she is entitled to - Abram says we ought to have
taken notice of her, I have little doubt but he wou'd, observing her
stranger, now the short & the long of it is, I want thee (if not allready acquainted)
to introduce Thyself & for The credit of Ballitore, Tell her how it was
S Medlicoat was intimate with her family & is quite concern'd at not knowing her
We concluded thou cou'd settle it all for us most agreeably.

I do not expect to see any body in Town To-day, but for my Cheltnam shou'd
be rather poorly, thou will oblige me by bringing me a bottle of it, to be got
I think at Bassicoats & if convenient please get me a remnant of oilcloth
about 1 1/2 yds more or less as it happens - also a neat fruit knife with
LW upon the blade; [underline]privately between thee & Betsy,[/underline] - if the Girls want
anything in Richard Hadsons way (which I think they do) it wou'd be a
good way to get from him, bring an account, & thier Father can settle
he is a kind Son, & deserves to be considered - We hope to see George upon
1st day. The place (Barcroft says) looks rather more comfortable it had need
be & Eben both seem to like it Parkinson, & expect he may from a useful
helped My wife has resigned the pen - I have very little
to say, or that "I see at present" - I should like that
even if you were to see Anna Rund - not that I
think any deficiency is on our side of hospitable
"intent" - I should like her kindness acknowledged - if
it fell in the way & that's all - I find that John
White staid 2 days in Co Carlow after I left him. I
wrote to Thos. Barley last night & mentioned then
what occurred - We are rather bare of intelligence
or information - I apprehend John Houghton gets
on in his matrimonial scheme. Anna seems
as well as usual. I do not just now feel in a
letter writing humour. So farewell
If thou cou'd purchase a neat Chest of drawers
for about 3 guineas more or less according to
goodness, not too high for a table, several here wou'd be
obliged. [deletion]J B wou'd be a good judge but[/deletion]

My dear aunt
Here I again appear, but do not fear I will not
tarry long, I only mean to tell thee that I saw my mother
to-day and helped her to dress herself; she is a great
deal better, cool and lively, and was to eat a bit of
chicken to-day for dinner; she told me she felt
so weak she could not sit up she thought. Wm
[unclear]Lefanne[/unclear] has not seen her for two days, unless he
came since I saw her. but he wrote two ve
lite notes to her; she took Cheltenham salts yesterday.
but cannot as yet feel any benefit from them.
With dear love to Margaret I remain thy affte neice
and very pretty.
I saw Hannah White today, she looked very well & hearty
I put the last words wrong mind I mean [unclear]E.W.[/unclear]
My aunt desires me to say that John Farmer's going
on Thomas Bewley's horse has entirely altered the
plan of sending a horse for you with JB so you
have time to fix what day you would wish it
sent, if convenient to you, aunt thinks
first day would do best for the horse to leave
this. My aunt would be glad Betsy would bring a
bale of neat crimson marking cotton. When
Betsy and Mary come give my dear dear love to
them and say I would like dearly to write to both
but cannot get it accomplished at present
again farewell EL
