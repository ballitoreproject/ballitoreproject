good looks, he gave me four Rigate
tickets. so perhaps we may go
on third day. Uncle James and
Aunt Liddy we quite expected to have
found here on our return, for they
intended coming out by the 11

a white petticoat were spied on the
avenue, and very soon after their
owners were seated quietly in the
library. John was with them,
the train was so full, they could
not get seats, so had to drive to
Merrion and come out by the old
railway, greatly to Aunt Liddy's

pleasant indeed to have Aunt Liddy
out here again. Hussy Walsh
