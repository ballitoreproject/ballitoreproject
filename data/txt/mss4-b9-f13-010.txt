& poor Anna Fayle
Richmond 21st of 7th month 1823 -
My dearest Sarah
I intended writing to thee to day, &
was finishing reading [insertion]the 1st vol: of[/insertion] Quentin Durward aloud for Mary
S & Sally - prior to [underline]engaging in my mental conversation[/underline]
with thee when thy scanty letter was handed me - scanty
but very welcome. I wrote a note instantly to James
desiring him to call on Josiah Gough to day - which
he did & brought me word he (Josiah) would go tomorrow
I had destined this sheet to go by another hand - but
now I will send it by him - Oh! how thy letter made
me wish we could live near each other near enough to
visit & gossip - would it benefit us I wonder dear knows!
but we should at least be happier. George & Hannah
got through the presentation well - right well. H: was little
agitated & spoke audibly - tolerably so - We had a large
company to dine & take tea - among them our fair cousin
Anne Grubb who tells me she cannot yet wed her Thos
but that she will never wed [underline]no[/underline] other. Her father brought
her to Killarney also the Morris's joined them.
Hannah liked both her gowns very well - so did my
choice father. I think he is at last recovering - I could
live with him for ever & love him too at the end - not
make a petticoat of him - I am greatly hurried like
thyself - but intend to write soon again - either to
thee or Edward - whom assure it would have given
me great pleasure to have returned to see, & to join
the [unclear]Luggalaw[/unclear] party - Am I forgiven by the thy father
I would not willingly offend him, or any of my
Margaret is his greatest favorite & [insertion]he[/insertion] thinks no child
equal to her - A Harvey's little girl is a beauty.
I send thee a [underline]small[/underline] bodkin for Maggies running
strings. - I wish I had thy clothes to bleach
Whenever thou wants a silk shawl washed, always
send it to me - I can get always done at the
Bleach Green, & it will look like new. Do my
dear - it would give me delight to be doing any
thing for thee.
My dear love to Edward & kisses
to Bonny - Love thy loving sister
I would had I time have written
to Eliza give her my dear love & tell [insertion]her[/insertion] to
expect a bullet from me soon.
I hope thou are pretty well. - I guess by thy
letter thou did not leave Meg in Ballitore
as a hostage for thy return. I am glad aunt
[underline]LJ Fisher[/underline]

of my Glendruid friends - yet I fear they thought
me careless of my promise - Ah! when shall I see
you again, & thee & my sweet pet. - I felt very
lonely also & particularly missed Maggie - nursing
[insertion]her[/insertion] was such a delightful amusement. - She will be
a chattering little runaway when I behold her next
& will not care a straw for aunt Lyds - I shall not
love her the less. Mary - for thou asks me [deletion]&[/deletion] how
we [unclear]met[/unclear] in - sometimes teazes me with her extreme
rudeness & carelessness of others feelings & makes
me blush for her obstinacy. - but I ought not to
tell this nor that I expect little comfort while
she stays, with endeavouring contin[insertion]u[/insertion]ally to
humour her. - Oh! how unlike dear Betsy - who
soothed me & consoled me, & bore, & made the
best of every thing. - I intend getting Hannah
to ask Elizth to the wedding, & to join my
invitation to her staying longer [deletion]than[/deletion] I wonder
will she come! - On unpacking my trunk
I found a sugar tongs, folded in paper with
E Leadbeater written on it, with J's & my initials
on it. - I suppose a gift from her, but I know
no more. - I had rather she had let me
forget some unpleasantnesses ere she gave me
any thing - or indeed I had rather she would
always keep her gifts & treat me with some
[insertion]Boardman[/insertion] is pleasant - Richd Shackleton rode to Adair to
day dined with John Christy - Agnes's brother -
who lives there unmarried & rents 160 acres of
land Adairs domain. he enquired [underline]kindly[/underline] after
all Ballitore

sisterly affection when we meet. I am happier
here than before I left this, - I have no wish of
going any where - save to Dublin & there I
indulge distant dreams of visiting with
pleasure. Oh! my poor Deborah - bitterly
have I regretted saying things I did to thee
lest I might have made thee think hardly
of her when we should love & cherish as a
drooping flower we may have to weep sadly
over - Oh! it cuts me when I think how
little I minded being with her in Ballitore
& how little I minded parting her. - I ran to
see little Peg-a-Ramsay & kissed her sleeping
cheek with - I wont go on.
Thou wert right thou should have no
business to write a word without mentioning
Mag: - never do. - How did thee sleep the
night I left thee - I thought greatly of you when
on my pillow & felt more then & now at
leaving you all than during the journey.
George & M - were pretty pleasant on the way.
I have burnt thy letter - would that thou would grow
good & write often to me. I did not show it to
James - [deletion]he[/deletion] I read him some of it & he never
[deletion]a[/deletion]wishes to see any letter I choose to hide
