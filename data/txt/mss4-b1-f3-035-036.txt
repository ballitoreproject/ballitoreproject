					Dublin, 27th of Fourthmonth 1771.
		Though I am not agreeably circumstanced, in divers respects, for writing at present, yet I look upon it as my manifold duty to send htee a line of short intelligence about our meeting to-day, seeing thou wast disabled from being present in body with us. Thy absence, as well as many other vacancies which have happened, and the want of that solid weightiness which should clothe the spirits of those who sit in such a meeting, was cause of humiliation and distress; yet I humbly believe, that a degree of that which only makes a living soul, reigned over all. The accounts received from the three provinces, were much in the usual strain of language, not worse: but I think, if any alteration, rather more agreeable than of late. My brother (schoolmaster) John Gough, I hope, enlarged in his peculiar gift to general edification. Our friends Samuel Fothergill and John Stephenson opened, I believe, in pertinent counsel and remarks, accompanied with gospel-authority and evidence. The former had it in his mind to propose in the meeting the holding of a general-meeting of conference, collectively for friends of both sexes, in which the London-queries should be read, which is accordingly agreed uon, to begin at nine o’clock on second-day morning *** We received Debby’s letters this afternoon: I fear that they will have trouble at home about A. W. Perhaps the accession of his present complaint may hurry him out of his poor decayed body. May he havea  place of rest prepared for the poor spirit. The righteous hath hope at his death, a period that inevitably awaits us all; and those who go off beofre us, precede us that follow by a very short interval of fleeting time. *** My wife and daughter join in dutiful and cordial wishes for thy restoration, with me and many more. 	I remain, with dear love,
								Thy dutiful and affectionate son
