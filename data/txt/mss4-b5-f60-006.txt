Anner Mills 12th 4th month 1823
My dear friend
Mary Leadbeater
My Son Richardsons servant goes to
see my Grandson and by him I purpose sending this with
two Pound notes to reimburse thee for thy kind attention
in advancing so much for me - the numbers are as follow
12084 - 5th October 1822
9169[deletion]4[/deletion] - 8th August - 1822
Thou canst manage to inform me of thy recving this
I am always glad to have perusal of thy letters there is such
a spirit of love pervades thy actions as very much endears
thee to me and I do not pass by thy dear Sister Sarahs very
kind recollections - I take full notice of your respect for
my cousin Sarah Watson she has been an Elder worthy
of double honour, indefatigable in dedication to the service
of her divine Mother who early constituted her a Disciple
and has I trust a favour of righteousness laid up for her
I often think of thy sister Shackleton I am wearing a
pin cushion which she presented to my sister Abigail
which I value as the work of her fingers - our dear Mary
Holton is much favoured with clear intelect I know
must

much like that the L Lydia and I could meet, it would
revive old times - Lydia has comforts which Mary cannot
embrace and I have much to be positive for in Children
I enjoyed thy description of Richard Shackleton, what I
have seen of him impressed me very favorably - I trust
thy children & in time Grand children will solace thee
it is consoling that when natural powers are preeminent
religion stamps them with lustre - what exemplification 
of this is our sister Margaret Grubb!
I paid her a long and pleasant visit on 5th day
should the weather soften and remain dry I should
hope for her revival the cough is most troublesome
when her breathing is free - Sylvanus & Mary [unclear]Jean[/unclear]
ministered to her as thou Mayst suppose encouragingly
as to the better part - Eliza has three sweet
children - the eldest can amuse her Grandmother
I suppose your George & Elizabeth Shackleton will be
at the Q M - both couple of English friends are
expected to it - we had our visit from the Foxes
to an endearing effect - it is notable for the young
people to behold the Gifts and Graces of the Spirit
which these dedicated youthful Ministers exhibit
my daughter Richardson is at my side writing
also

also to Ballitore your frequent mention of Joshua Grubb
& Jonathan Richardson very much gratifies their friends
This family may be described in health - Elizabeth has her
William in the parlour quite animated - his Aunt R
thinks him a picture of health - Anna is puzzled about
her Sarah who tho not sick appears delicate Ruth has
had cold but is finely - I do not know whom of this
family will approach Dublin - thou hast new
attractions thither I cannot but lament that Sarah B
was deprived the delight of suckling her Margaret
Elizabeth managed herself nicely in readiness for Walter
but it flowed so she was often ready to repine at hiring
a nurse yet I hope it is so best - I hope my old friend
thy sister Chandlee will revive with this beautiful
weather My love attends her - and Abigail & R. Widdows
I often commisserate Abby under her trying illness
The account of Mary [unclear]Christy[/unclear] Strangman was not
this morning yet we reckon on her being in some degree
restored to us - I understood her Sister Elizabeth ventured
to leave her yest.day. Joshua Jacob Senior is in
a Rheumatic fever - Julia Jacob is doing well by last
report - Dear Elizabeth Blain supported under
her loss of an amiable husband - Cousin Sarah Courtney
poorly

I expect our friend Anne Shannon will visit her and
come thence to me - Cousin M. Watson seems timid
of encountering our Q M lest it should impede her
attendance (as last year) of the National Meeting but
I hope she will accomplish both - Dear Sarah Doyle
has closed her service in the Militant Church - [unclear]Loudon[/unclear]
Allan
went first to reap reward from him who judgeth in the Earth
our Sister Margaret pants for a succession of standard
bearers she mourns at the prospect of leaving so fair
Now the perfect love which casts out fear 
into a long letter when I only intended a note
accept it from an heart flowing with love to thee & my other
friends
