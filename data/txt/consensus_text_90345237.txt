sing and also dance- a minuet
Oh it was really, very funny- We
afterwards danced and sung for
him in return, which he seemed
to think quite a favor. The
to think quite a favour. The
musical box being a little out of
order T H brought it with him to
Belfast where he left it to be repaired
14- We took a very pleasant walk
this morning- Uncle Thomas
and Aunt Eliza spent the day
here, coming to dinner, which was
very pleasant.
15th- Went to meeting this morning,
which was another fine one. Polly
was introduced duced by Maria to several
of the friends there. We saw Phoebe
Anna Chandler, who is with Anna
Maria Uprichard as governess to her children.
On returning we took a walk in
the lawn, the roads being too sloppy
to go farther. I had a welcome letter
from Margt this morning.
