My dear Richard,

	+++ At present there is cause for much gratitude on account of the day of prosperity, which we are now favoured withBy & by no doubt comes, in the revolution of the seasons, a day of adversity, equally good & profitable for usMay we all, my dear friend, so improve the merciful visitations of heavenly regard & notice, that whether the north or the south-wind blow upon our gardens, the Lords plantation in us may flourish & bring forth fruit, to the praise of the good & gracious husbandman! I am persuaded that his fatherly intention is to do good to your fathers house, & to make it useful & honourable to & among his peoplebut many, very many are the dangers & temptations from within & from without, which awaitthe necessary cares of this life, & the pursuit of things lawful from the purest & noblest motives, if carried to an improper excess, may clog the feet of the inward man, & prevent his running with alacrity the race, which by divine appointment is set before himthe seeking great things, the aspiring after this worlds grandeur, the imitating & emulating others who are not devoted in body, soul, spirit and substance to the cause of Truth, hurts the tender plant of renown [sic], & retards its growthBut to be diligent in the spirit of our minds, often cultivating seasons of retirement, watching [page number] 186 daily & hourly unto prayer for preservation from evil, & divine acceptance, witnessing from time to time that baptism which cleanses from all defilement of flesh & spirit, doing nothing which we are persuaded in the secret of our own minds is wrong, & being faithful to every manifestation of active dutythis I believe is the way to draw down the blessing of heaving upon us, & to perpetuate it among us.
	Farewell, my dear Richard, & believe me
		very affectionately thine
			Richard Shackleton
