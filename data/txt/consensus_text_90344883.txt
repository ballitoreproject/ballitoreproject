[deletion]3[/deletion]1st.. We both got up wonderfully
early but alas! the morning
looked so gloomy & rain-like,
that we almost despaired of

do was to get the car as soon
as possible after breakfast &
take them a drive through
Sir George hudsons' which they
admired very much: we left
them at the top to the hill.
