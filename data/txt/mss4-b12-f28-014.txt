2nd letter
My dearest Mama
Since I wrote my 1st letter
we met with a little adventure
so I open my letter to put in
this - it is pleasant now our letter
was too late to post in Baveno
only for that I could not add
this - we left Baveno at 2-30 -
in a very funny machine I dont
know what to call it - I believe they
call it "Char" here something like
their country waggons with seats
across it - The bargain was made
that they should bring us to Domo
d'Ossola to night - the man from
whom we hired the "Char" said
he wd give us [underline]good[/underline] horses - he

2
gave us the two worse I ever
saw - we did not go far till
we had to leave one on the
road - & by great beating the
other brought us here in two
hours - every one here speaks
Italian - Mrs Crawford went into
a gentlemans house to look for
some one who spoke french - we
got him to tell the boy who drove
us - that we wd not pay him
so we were obliged to stop here
not being able to get fresh horses
to take us on; we will leave
as early as we can tomorrow
for fear the man we bargained
with in Baveno will follow us
for the money wh Uncle did
not pay nor I believe has no right
to pay - we can breakfast
