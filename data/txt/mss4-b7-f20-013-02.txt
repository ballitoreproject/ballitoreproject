March 15 - 1817
Dear Mrs. Leadbeater
I have it not now in
my power to answer your last obliging
letter, but I write just to say that I
have enclosed to you some papers of a
Dr. Davis's I believe, which Mr. Smith
has just had printed as thinking
that the dissemination of them may be
useful to the public and I am sure
that they cannot be in better hands than
yours. - I shall either send now or soon
ansd 9/4 mo: 1817

as I can procure a frank some arithmetical
tables that I think will be useful to
your school. I hope Owen goes on well
as Tutor, and that he is a worthy
young man blessing and blest where e're
he goes - I hope all your family are
well. I am dear Mrs Leadbeater
Yours sincerely
Frances Smith
