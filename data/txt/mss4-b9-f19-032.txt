directions for wearing [insertion]the[/insertion] gown
before it is put on thou art
to put on a tucker L White's
gown had one tacked to
It I fear thou wilt think
the back too wide but
it is line L White's which
we had for a pattern
I have drawn the front strings
a little at each side of the
apron, which I hope thou
thou wilt not undraw

as it will look better to be
full. I think thou always
wore them too tight
now I hope thou wont
fret if it is not to thy
liking but put up with it
as it is & it will look
very well & fit too I hope
if thou follow [underline] my [/underline] directions
[unclear][/unclear]
I did not think
thy long sleeves would be fit
to put in [deletion] again [/deletion] a new body
