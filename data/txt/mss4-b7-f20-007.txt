Will you excuse me for requesting you not again to send so many
Franks. Mr. Smiths privelege only extends to receiving fifteen and writing ten
in a day, which puts it entirely out of his power to permit any one person to
send more than [underline]two at a[/underline] time unless upon [underline]very[/underline] extraordinary occasions.
Your ten franks to Mrs Ramage I will certainly endeavor to send
though it will probably be a long time before she can receive them -
I have not as yet sent one, Mr Smith is at this time a great deal absent
from home on account of the meeting of Parliament, so that it is quite
out of our power to request franks of him, and when he is at home, he has

so many persons to frank for, as you know our family is very large, thus it may
perhaps be two months before your Friend can secure the book, your letter
I will endeavor to send some time next week if Mr Smith has not too many
franks in request; but it would be a pity to make her pay for it, which
she probably would do if Mr Smiths number is full. I thought it necessary
to say thus much to shew you the nature of franking which I daresay
you are quite unacquainted with.
A letter I am sure Mr Smith will have great pleasure in franking
for you, when you wish it, either to Ireland of Cumberland, and therefore I
hope you will occasionally permit me, to request [insertion]it[/insertion] of him - I am very glad

the reviewers have been so gracious to you. You know we think you deserve
it - with sincere wishes for your success in all your undertakings
I am with much esteem yours
