24th,, Papa went to town this morning
& returned at night. so much for the
[deletion][unclear]xxxxxx[/unclear][/deletion] new railway. Let me see now
what we did to day - not very much
I'm thinking. Took a walk down
to Mr Gaskins [insertion]on business[/insertion] & back - On our return
found Margt + Huldah Pim who had
come to spend the day. After dinner
we worked out of doors - the evening was
so inviting. Philip is complaining of a
headache this evening, I hope it won't
signify I'm sure. Every one are in but
I think so I must follow the example.
Had a nice letter from [insertion]Polly & another note [unclear]from[/unclear][/insertion] Thomas Henry.
x 25th A lovely day. Uncle R, Aunt E and
Florence dined and took tea here.
G, and I drove down to Bray to meet the
Kitfs, by the 5 train, Charlie came out
by the same train , but not liking
to crowd us on the car he said he would
walk. After tea we took a little stroll
up the fields, had some music and
played games. Florence staid with us
