Dear Cousin
Richard Shackleton/
An Irish Friend being so kind as to give us a Call, I thought I would just let thee know I received thy acceptable Letter & that we are pretty well in general -- my sister is now at Lancaster she will doubtless write you by the same hand -- We have lately heard an agreeable Account of my Brother, tho tis almost 2 years since we received any Letters from his own hand, my sister & I have both wrote to him very lately. My Husband & Children join me in Love to thyself cousin Shackleton & your Children & Nephew from thy affectionate Kinswoman
