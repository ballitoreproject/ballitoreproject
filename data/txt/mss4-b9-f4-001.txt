Limerick 18 of November 1823
My dear brother Edward,
Through Sarah I believe it was I received
an invitation to salute you with a few black lines &
now that Lydia is in Clonmel & I alone to furnish
you with tidings of us, I take the opportunity of Bab
Fisher's going up, to tell Sarah in particular that the Box
has arrived safely though not until its mistress was forty
miles away - and both of you that Lyd is quite well as
I understand from a letter I had from her last night - She
was quite delighted at receiving your letter & entertained with
your "tour of a day" - I hope we shall hear more from both
of you - You are both bound by half promises to tell us
the whole story & I have no suspicion of your being inclined
to break them - I wish very much to be able to see
those lakes & some of the southern parts of England also, but
there are so many things to prevent - want of time, opportunity,
company, money, and even sometimes disposition
at the very moment all the other wants may be supplied.
I am very fond of travelling when I can do so freely and
at my ease & leisure - but the constraint of travelling for business
or other necessity is very irksome - There are other constraints

& obstacles to one's pleasure also - In Scotland I was some
time before I recovered the disagreeable feeling I had after having
visited the Falls of the Clyde - Altho' I had passed through & seen
the most beautiful country of all I had witnessed in my whole
tour - yet being anxious to go home, fearing I might be wante[deletion]y[/deletion]d
prevented my devoting as much time to those beauties
as they required - The Coach from Glasgow goes to Lanark
and returns the same day - It remains five hours at Lanark
to allow the company to dine & to visit the Falls and the factory
at New Lanark The Coach stopped within some miles
of Lanark & we got down to view a very beautiful fall,
but here were were plagued with the clamours of a multitude
of urchins all seeking the honour & emolument of guiding us -
fully sympathetic minds - then when we had half viewed
this beautiful cascade - the horn sounded a retreat & we
had to leave a beautiful circular sun bow formed on the
rising spray to waste its prismatic colours without an eye
to drink them [deletion]it[/deletion] in - When we came very near Lanark-
the Coach stopped again & let us down to take a round on foot
to the town, through the celebrated Cartland Craigs, the asylum
of Wallace - Here the multitude again assailed us - We could

however view a magnificent bridge which the spoiling hand of Man had
side of the Ravine & bade us look across & we should see - I asked
The Bridge has two arches & is supported in the middle by an immensely
high pier - it is dizzying to look over the battlements to the foot
of the pier in the shallow stream below - the smallness of the stream
contrasts with the great height of the pier - Yet this more astonished
than delighted me, for I felt vexed with seeing such sacred solitude
rendered public & common - & the very wild abode which the hero
had chosen as a secret & unknown hiding place laid bare by the
[underline]desolating[/underline] hand of civilization - To add to this vexation, we agreed
with a guide to shew us Wallace's Cave - He led us to the opposite
raised across the deep ravine which runs between the Craigs on each side
him would he not take us into it - Oh, no! this was the spot
every one looked at it from - I determined to see for myself
& had actually descended the Craigs to near the bottom when
I recollected I might miss seeing the Factory & the other falls - so
I ascended & found all the company gone - I was vexed & tired
& had to ask a little boy to shew me the way to the town - I
found the party all setting out for the Falls - I went too - and
we passed [deletion]a[/deletion] [insertion]along the[/insertion] beautiful banks of the enchanting Clyde till we
arrived at Lady Somebodys in whose demesne is the Corra
Lynn - She has servants to attend visitors & who doubtless thus
collect their wages - I would have given them double fees to stay
away - for here again we were plagued - I was - with their showman-like

talk & besides there were regular gravel walks which we
were to follow & my lady did not allow visitors to [insertion]do[/insertion] this or to do that
I wished my lady in Jericho - We saw the magnificent Corra Linn
in chains as much as its free waters could be between the high
& haughty banks of two aristocratic proprietors - With all its beauty
it had not half the charms for me, that the Bracklinn fall,
up among the wild hills near Benladi had - We had not time
to go on further to see another fall & indeed my spirits turned
me to the Factory that I might rather see the works of art themselves
than see the glorious works of Nature defaced by Art - One
fall and a Cave in the Rock of old traditionary fame have been
completely destroyed in forming the weir for the Factory - This
too displeased me altho I endeavoured to forget it in the happy
looks that surrounded me in Owen's village - Neatness & happiness
seemed here hand in hand to contrast with the dirt & squalor
of the Old town about a mile distant, with the residence of
the Philanthropist himself placed between, as a bulwark as
it were - and yet, as if to have alloy in all, our guide who
seemed to be of the old squalid school took delight in detailing
every instance of Owen's want of success in reforming manners -
the rascal exaggerated too - We dined & returned to Glasgow where
we arrived on a cold night, to a comfortless dirty Inn - the Stag's Head
never go there - But this is tremendous egotism - however
there you have a day of mine & besides an illustration of the
