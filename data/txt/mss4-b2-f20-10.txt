From Richard Shackleton to  
Ballitore 13/8 month 1791
Dear Friend,
	My duty as a member of religious society, my friendship for thy late worthy father & mother, & my personal attachment to thee is all the excuse which I have to make for giving thee the trouble of this letter. Thy cousin I.L. told me confidentially last evening that a person not of our religious persuasion had made an application for marriage with thee, & thy cousin seemed fearful lest thou shouldst incline to favour the proposal. This gave me considerable concern, & I believe if thou shouldst enter into this temptation, thou wilt find it to be pregnant with sorrow, disappointment & remorse. Know, dear friend, that it is no light thing, but an evil thing & bitter to commit a transgression of so complicated a nature  The law of God in his written, revealed word is every where against it  his just witness, the light & grace in thy own conscience loudly reclaims against it  the risks, established & sanctioned by Divine Wisdom, in our religious society, are expressly against it  the mind of thy honourable parents, who were concerned in their day for the cause of Truth, & are now removed (I doubt not) to everlasting rest, (thou well knowest) would have been strongly against it  thy best friends & nearest connexions who are living are (I suppose) all unitedly against it  Then what blessing, what comfort can be expected from an union neither approved by God nor Man?  Stop, dear child, on the brink of this precipice, & proceed no farther  the evil is soon committed; but many ye[Page torn] of anxiety, vexation & distress may not atone for the transgression  remember t[Page torn] art now timely warned  Reason not with thyself, that thou art sensible [Page torn] thing is wrong; yet that many have done the same  that there hast a Judge  that he may be pleased to pardon the trespass  & that thou mayest, notwithstanding, live as happily & comfortably as most others do  Thus to reason against conviction is to tempt God, from whose penetrating eye not a thought of our hearts can be hid; who is jealous of his honour; & righteous in his judgments, as well as abundant in mercy  Remember the case of Esau, who sold his birth-right for a sensual gratification, When he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears.  Indeed thou hast long been the object of the kind notice & tender desire of many of thy friends, as well as the subject of their anxiety & concern. Thou knowest whether their gentle, affectionate, yet pressing remonstrances & invitations, often repeated, were ever effectual to induce thee to come more closely into the warm, fostering bosom of thy mother, the Church, & to submit to her wholesome discipline  thou knowest whether any of their private warnings, documents, & reproofs ever prevailed on thee to depart from, & renounce that spirit of conformity to the world, which leads into a vain & foolish & hurtful imitation of its manners & fashions in dress & otherwise  As therefore much labour & pains have been taken with thee by many of thy friends, the servants; & the Great Master himself (no doubt) has done his part, by his gentle wooings & strivings, as well as by his secret monitions, reproofs, & chastisements, beware how thou rejectest such mercies, & turnest thy back on the means of thy own salvation. I believe that for any member of our religious society to be thus unequally yoked in marriage is highly displeasing in the sight of God; & that the repetition of examples of this kind is no palliation, but an aggravation of the offence. I therefore, in true good-will, intreat thee, dear child, to refrain from this engagement, to cultivate the fear of thy Creator, & to come under the holy discipline of the Spirit of Truth, which will [re?]form [Page torn] & regulate body, soul & spirit; & if happily (which is totally) given way to, will make [Page torn] truly amiable & desirable in the eyes of thy Maker & of wise & good men. That this [Page torn] be thy experience is the hearty desire of thy sincere, affectionate friend
	Richard Shackleton
