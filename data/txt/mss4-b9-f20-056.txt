My dear Elit
I recd thine with the enclosure but I have not
got to the books yet they are in the book binders
hands at present I believe as soon as they
come to me I will forward them to thee
I intend, I have written to S Davis to put her
in mind of her promise I hope thou wont disappoint
me I long to see some of you & to
show you little Richd. [unclear]Monliffe[/unclear] so he is
after all our Richards & my mother's broth[unclear][/unclear]
I am as well as can be expected he quite well
& very quiet & good, could not thou manage to
come up even a few days before the meeting
Rebecca Ridgeway is come, Hannah Pim
still lingers but is daily weaker & weaker
& greatly teazed with a cough & wishing the waiting
patiently for the close, Jane Hall is with her
still her mother brother & one of her sisters are
there also hoping soon to see thee I conclude
13th
ever thy SB
