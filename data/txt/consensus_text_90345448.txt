15 Tuesday. Went to town early
this morning as Philip Charlie and
I were going to a party at Mrs Rigby's
And a very pleasant one it was too.

Most of the company were strangers
to me so that I was very glad to
see Aunt Martha, Emmy, Uncle
Arthur and Uncle Frederick there.
Such dancing ! as there was. I really
was almost frightened at the way
the floor shook and would not
have been much surprised had it
given way -. We had tea on
a little side parlour into which we
were ushered on our arrival and where
[deletion]was[/deletion] we were received by Miss Mary

Rigby - her Mamma being stationed

in the drawing room -. Well on my
entrance to this little parlour I soon
recognised William Rigby's family
ie - his married daughter Kate
