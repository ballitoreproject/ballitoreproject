The last letter I wrote I told you up as far as
2nd day last which was the 6th the Jacobs I said were
to be here, my Aunt & Mary Jacob & little Saml. were all
that came, little Jos having been very ill Jos came
to tea, it was six oclock as they left this, so we had tea
pretty early. just as they went, in walked Mary Henry
& her Mother from Dalkey so we had another tea
for them & as soon as they were alone in came the
Doctor & Catherine "Mr Thomas" from Dublin so we
had pretty well of visitors for one day.
3rd day up betimes to go to town to a youths meeting
at the particular request of Elizabeth Robson so my
Mother Eliza Ann & Emy & I set off leaving Mary to
mind the house by herself. we were a pretty care-full,
went first to Dominisk st- No 8 where we left Emy & Ann
to mind her the latter had the opportunity of seeing her
mother whom I suppose thou knows is there, called
to know how Sarah was on our way to meeting I found
her & baby getting on there to meeting, afterwards I
went with Bess Harvey to see her little child which
is a fine stout little lump as well as I could see it
in the cradle, where it lay fast asleep. did not stay
very long but went to Weiburgh street, where Emy
came to see Grandmama, she knew the place quite
well & went about the house calling [underline]dada[/underline] & [underline]mama[/underline]
& saying they were [underline]gone[/underline], [underline]gone[/underline], it is curious how well

she remembers. I left there [deletion]where[/deletion] & went to Miholey
street where we all met & dined. Jos having engaged us
yesterday when he was out. after dinner went over to
Britain street for the car & saw Sarah & my little nephew,
S looks badly & is determined to take care of
herself this time, brought the car for my Mother &
Emy & set off home. I found all safe.
4th day. 8th Edward out to day & gone to Fassaroe so I
suppose Sarah is getting on. My Mother & Eliza went
to Dalkey this evening & left Emy & I all alone by ourselves,
they were not home till near eleven. so I suppose
they were very pleasant I found out that the Doctor
& "Mr Thomas" were there.
5th day 9th yesterday Mr Junell came down & asked us
to go up & take tea with them but could not as my
Mother & I had fixed to go to Dalkey, so he said this
evening would do as well, so we went & had a very
pleasant evening. & they are to be with us tomorrow.
I forgot to mention that I got Franks journal yesterday
for which I am obliged & hope he will be a good boy &
continue it, that is a terrible thing about Excles, he
must be a brute or he would not have acted so unfeelingly,
the poor widow is to be pitied. I wonder
very much that they would let Excles out on bail.
6th day 9th Eliza off early to town. Mary Henry came
over soon after breakfast with the little girl (Philips
daughter) who they said would not answer them

as they could get her to do nothing that she was desired
I think they could scarcely have given her a fair trial
in a week, & that they do not know how long it takes to
train a child. I put on my bonnet to go part of the
way home with Mary H I got as far as the cottage
on the road when we met Eliza Pim & Bess Harvey
they had walked here & had [deletion]expected[/deletion] expected the
car & the nurse & child to overtake them but the
little one chose to sleep longer than usual. I told them
my Mother was at home. & I just went as far as the
stile into [unclear]Howards[/unclear] fields & then came back. the
little one arrived pretty soon after me & is a gay little
[underline]short-faced, black-eyed[/underline] little thing not much
like the doctor thou may suppose when it has
got a short face. Eliza Pims two daughters
came too, they are very rude disagreeable
girls & I never like to come in contact with them.
what a [underline]contrast[/underline] they are to the [underline]Junells[/underline]. they hard
a pretty reasonable long visit eat bread & butter &
plum jam, but no wine & so the visit was ended
the two Miss Pims not even deigning to [underline]say farewell[/underline]
my Mother & I were just going to sit down to dinner
when who should I see passing the window but
Aunt Jane, Elizabeth & Florence, so we had an addition
to our company but not to our dinner which consisted
of potatoes & french beans & a little hair soup, however
such as it was they were welcome to, Aunt Jane
said it was just what she would like as her head was
so poorly she would not eat meat even if it was there.

they had brought out Jane Stephens to spend a few days
with Patty. After dinner Eliza returned solus from
town, & Elizabeth & Aunt Jane &c. set off to town.
Mr Junell his sister & Jane & Bessy came to tea they
are really very agreeable people Mrs Junell sent an
apology that she had not been out of an evening for
two years. so we could hardly expect her to come to us
they staid till near eleven & then went.
7th day 11th nothing particular today save that it was
as fine a day as ever I saw, I took a little ride by
myself & got a mouthful of fresh air up on the hill
& also went up to Fullagh church it is a long time since
I was there before. met no adventure all the time
I was out. After dinner went to pay my respects to
Francis May[unclear]lone[/unclear] in a unclear]low[/unclear]
of[unclear]lane[/unclear]. unclear]probaber prim[/unclear] 4[unclear][/unclear]

Jane Stephens & found them preparing to go out so I went with
them. we went to Caulk mines where I have not been since
they built the new bridge, it was almost dark when we got
home, winter is coming fast. Eliza went down to the cottage
to tea.
1st day 12th E& I went to meeting. it was preparative & we
were home before half past twelve so neither of the meetings
could have been very long. found Arthur in the parlour
when we got home. John Martha & Frederic came out
to dinner & they are just now after going off & I have
sat down to give thee an account of our proceedings
which I think I have done pretty fully, & now let me
tell thee that I am half offended with thee for not
writing me a line since I left thee not even as much
as one [insertion]line[/insertion], did thou send me. perhaps thou wilt be tired
before thou gets through the half of this if so tell me & I
will not fill the next sheet so full. Arthur would
be obliged by Frank sending him next opportunity 1 lb of tea
& quarter of stone of 8d sugar.
I have only time to say I hope to hear from you soon
