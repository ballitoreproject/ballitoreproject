Dear Sister, Areton 30th 1st mo 1729
Having this opportunity by our Dear friend Mary
Slayler thought fit to send a few lines to
let you know yt we are pretty well in health
except my Mother who is weak so that -
notwithstanding I have a great desire to
See you & could freely take a voyage
into Ireland yet I cannot think it a proper
time to come this Spring but would not
have that to be an hinderance to any of
you from comeing over I hope you will
be very glad to See Mary Slayler in
Your Country I do not doubt but her visit
will be very acceptable to friends in
that Nation. I writ lately to you by post
I hope you have read it. I have not -
much to write at this time to you. Wishing
you health & eternal felicity I remain
Your Lo. Brother
