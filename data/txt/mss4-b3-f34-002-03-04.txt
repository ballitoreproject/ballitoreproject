My dear friend,
        Though a personal interview has fallen out since I had the pleasure of thy last letter, yet I do not hold myself discharged from my epistolary debt. Indeed the interview was so short, that it seemed only like a whet to the appetite for conversation  by no means a full meal  and the pen must be recurred to, in order to make up the deficiency.
        I hope thou didst not repent thy having attended that meeting at Carlow  I thought something of the Ancient Power overshadowed  my poor spirit was where it wishes to be ^ & where it is not satisfied unless it be ^ low, down, & in the deeps. This is the Potters house, in which the clay is softened, is moulded, is formed into that kind of vessel, which the Master chooseth  Here we learn to know ourselves, & the first rudiments of true Religion  genuine Humility  & in this school of Christ only can we become adepts in Christian knowledge  First, Worm Jacob  then Israel, a prince & prevailer with God.
        I have heard nothing of thy movements, my dear cousin, since I saw thee  probably thou art still in the County Carlow, & I may be the [page number] 110 bearer of this letter myself  Be that as it may, it will answer my purpose if it conveys to thee any where a token of my unfeigned affection, and if it happily should be made instrumental to strengthen any good desire, or to waft forward any breathing petition on its [sic] way to the holy place. ++++++++++
        I am, my dear Cousin,
                very affectionately thine
                Richard Shackleton
