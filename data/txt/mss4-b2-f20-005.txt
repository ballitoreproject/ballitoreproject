Richard Shackleton to __

Dear friend
	I confess it looks hardly decent in me to make no return of this sort to two several obliging letters which I have had from thee. A variety of engagements prevented my doing it sooner, not want of attention or affection to thee +++
Thou enquires concerning my Fathers health; he has had several attacks of (what is called) a bilious Colick; we were much alarmed about him: but thro favour of good providence he has recruited finely: however, his hardly by any means suffering himself to be taken proper care of subjects him to the danger of a return of his disorder, & us to the frequent fears respecting him. Manifold indeed is the loss which we would ^should^ sustain by the translation of my venerable father: but the loss of his weighty spirit, exemplary life, & lively services in our poor, destitute society would be most of all to be lamented. A Cause, Dear friend, worthy the attachment of the most dignified natures; a mystery so glorious that even angels have desired to pry into it; Christianity in its purity, undefiled with the mixture of worldly wisdom & superstitious ceremonies, hath been revealed from Heaven to our ancestors. They nobly stood by it & faithfully kept that which was committed to their trust. They have rested from their labours here, & are now in the full possession of the fruits of these labours, even Life Eternal. There still remains the same cause to be supported in our Generation; the same Conflict to be maintained with the Grand Adversary of our happiness, & the corruptions of our fallen Nature; the same & only effectual means of Victory; & the same immortal Crown at the end, for him that overcometh.
But where are now the Combatants? The multitude professing to walk in the way of Truth are not in the way; they are not spiritually minded; they mind their own things, not the things of God: hence a general Indifference, as to the life & virtue of Religion has overspread us, like a Leprosy; our minds are not in a state prepared for that intercourse with the Divine Spirit, in which consists the happiness both of men & angels. Those Gifts & Graces which the Father of lights & spirits would pour out upon the living members, of his Church are withheld; & the shame of our nakedness is visible even to them that are without. Think of this, beloved friend, & let sorrow seize thy heart, because these things are so. Open thy heart to the convictions & judgments which are the preparatory dispensation to the Reception of pure & unmixed Good. Open thy doors, O Lebanon, & let the fire consume thy Cedars! If I am not mistaken, thou art not altogether unacquainted with this work. Thou hast felt something of the corroding smart of Judgment for Evil: thou hast felt the gentle Drawings & Invitations of the Spirit allowing thee out of the Friendship & familiarity of the world, & offering thee a place & a name in the Lords house & within his walls, better than of sons & of daughters. Thou hast seen & felt the instability & uncertainty of the nearest & dearest temporal enjoyments; & the great Vacuum, the Inanity, the Insufficiency of worldly Gratifications to satisfy the aspirations & Longings of an immortal Soul, has at times been opened to thy understanding & view. Mayst thou, Dear friend, ponder deeply where thou art, & whether thou hast in a noble, unreserved dedication of all, obeyd the heavenly Vision. Whether we seek great things for ourselves or not, our Time passes swiftly over, our places here will soon know us no more, & the Lord is determined to bring this evil (of death) upon all flesh & that wonderful fabrick of our bodies which he hath made will he break down. Happy will it then be for those, who, (their lives being spent here in humble, circumspect walking & the service of the best of Masters.) will have it said to them individually Well done! good & faithful servant, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord! Excuse this freedom which I have taken with thee on this solemn subject: a consciousness of my hearty desires for thy welfare emboldens me to use it.
