Extract from Nancy Sparkes' journal
19/10 mo : 1786 - The arrival of the sweet Leadbeater was
announced, none in the parlour to receive him, but myself -
how fine & manly his person! how soft & gentle his manners!
how interesting his looks! there is something [deletion]about[/deletion]
in him & about him that commands love & respect; he &
I soon engaged in [insertion]serious[/insertion] conversation, I thought I sensibly felt
that he was alluring by the soft, sweet voice of the good
Shepherd, from the follies & vanities of this delusive world,
to enter the fold of true rest; my heart warmed with
desire that he may happily accept the invitation
20th E: S: being engaged about family affairs, I had sweet
Leadbeater's company to myself all the forenoon - our
subjects of conversation were serious & religious, by the
part he took in them, & his looks (expressive of great
tenderness) I thought I felt the conflict of his mind was
great, between desires to be enabled to come up in faithfulness
to the discoveries of light & grace, & the fear
that the Prince of darkness would prevail. Oh how do I
long that he may be faithful in the day of small
things, unreservedly throwing himself on the protecting
arm of power, which can enable to resist all other powers
& bear the head above every wave of temptation!

21 st W. L. took an affectionate leave of us, our eyes followed
him as far as they could, & our best wishes accompanied
him in the way that he went - Being left pretty much
alone, I was led into a train of reflections about dear
Leadbeater, in near sympathy I surveyed the two paths
that opened to his view; the broad one which leads directly
down to the dreary chambers of death, & the narrow
one which terminates in the ocean of unfathomable
joy & bliss. My prayer was, & is that his goings may
be happily established in the latter, but ah! sensible
I am that he has much to part with, ere he can be
enough reduced as to be able to walk therein, with a
hope that he knows the avenue of access to that power
which alone can give him strength to take up the
cross & despise the shame inseperable from the
christian race. I must leave him, wishing it was
in my power to send him more essential help than
but wishes can impart, & other comfort than true
sympathy can give.
