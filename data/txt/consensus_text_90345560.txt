9th. Sunday - Fine and not quite
so cold as yesterday. I was glad Ned
did not [deletion]say[/deletion] wish to go to meeting
this morning as the drive would be
too much for him - We spent
the morning much as we did
this day week, first reading then
out then in again for an hour
and then out again - I think
Ned does not walk quite so well
as he has done of late - He goes slower
and often complains of the pain
in his chest - After dinner, for
in his chest -. After dinner, for
a wonder we sat in the drawing
room for awhile and then just went
out for a breath of fresh air met
Mr Hamilton and Mr Sullivan and
all came in together. Ned went
with them and another gentleman
to Mr Matterson's room where they
were going to have some kind of
meeting, reading the Bible &c &. -
I retired to my room where I
wrote and mused -.
