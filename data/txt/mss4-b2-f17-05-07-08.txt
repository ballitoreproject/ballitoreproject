My beloved friend,
	No part (I think) of the contents of thy letter seemed new to me  thy demand of our L.L., no more than thy engagement, however, her mother & I thought it our duty to give the matter proposed our best attention  we also conferred, in such manner as we were capable, with our dear child on the subject. On the whole, there seems no material impediment in our minds to Sallys attending upon thee, & rendering thee any assistance, which may be put in her power, in the course of thy important errand. Thou art, my dear friend, to see (with the best sight afforded) to thy own proper business, & the rectitude of thy movements  wait in thy the quietness, tarry at Jerusalem till the fulness of time comes, & the burden is ripe for unloading  then the endowment of the power will (I believe) not be wanting  but few are of letting in the discourager & the reasoner, who will be suggesting [crossed out in grey with the word omit] (squat like a toad, just at the ear of Eve) [pencil markings omitting previous quote] hath God said. & so be for invalidating, superseding, & frittering away the word of him who hath said, Heaven & earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away. He (the great Master) also adds, Take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting & cares of this life. My wife (who is [page number 273] indeed of the Noblesse) loves her children with strong maternal tenderness, & shudders at the thought of their delicate constitutions being exposed to the inclemency of weather, winter-journeys, &c  but she does not desire to make a monopoly of her children, she loves them, but she loves Truth better  & if any of them have, in the ordering of Infinite Wisdom, been graciously favoured to receive a Gift at the Lords hand, it would be matter of joy & gladness to her, & the crown of her old age, that they should devotedly exercise their gifts for the good of souls. To, take our child (may I say) in the Lords name, & may God Almighty bless & prosper & preserve you, both in this & every future service, to his glory, the edification of his church & your own peace! + + +
