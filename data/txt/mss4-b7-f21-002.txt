I never can for a moment suppose my dear Friend that you
are capable of any thing indelicate or unkind towards one _
I therefore entreat you will never think it necesary to apply
to me on such occasions, but do with the Garden, as you would
do if we were not your Friends - I do not fear saying this
much to you, because I am confident your generous heart
would leave us a superabundance. I am very Sincerely Yrs.
JY
I cannot express to you my dear Friend how sensibly I feel
your sweet attention, but you, who know so perfectly
how to oblige can easily imagine what it is to be highly
obliged. Accept I entreat you my sincere thanks, & believe
me very affectionately yrs. JY
