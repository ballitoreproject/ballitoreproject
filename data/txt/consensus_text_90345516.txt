not heard of their arrival last night
and were agreeably surprised to hear
voice in the hall - She has
a great deal to tell and will be
an entertaining companion for Polly
to whom she intends going on
Secondary - Papa had a
Sunday - Papa had a
letter from JH this evening saying
she was not very well and had
been knocked up by attending on
Erasmus and going about more
than was prudent - I wish
Margt could go to-morrow oh I wish
she could -
21 Sunday - Margt is not going
so poor Polly will be disappointed,
as she partly expected one of us
to day -. Oh that I knew how she
was -.
Uncle and Aunt Cole came
out to spend the day with us,
and John and Elizabeth drove
over to tea so there was quite
a gathering of us -.
I could not help thinking of
poor Polly every now and then
