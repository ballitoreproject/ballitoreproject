Leeds 6th month 1st 1800-
My dear cousin
Although personally unacquainted with thee, yes I have no doubt
but thou wilt be pleased to receive a letter from me: I hope it will find thee, thy mother and the
rest of thy family in good health, and that the people are quieter and more settled in the part
of the country where you reside than when my father was last in Ireland; the troubles which
infested the greatest part of your kingdom, we have been, and are at present strangers to, tho'
in many places in this favoured island a very riotous disposition has been prevalent
(occasioned it is thought by the scarcity and dearness of corn, and indeed of most kinds
of provision) but by the vigilance of the magistrates and soldiers it has in most places
been quelled without any bad consequences, except to one young man a near neighbour of our,
it was on a market day, the cavalry were called out in order that they might be in readiness
if there was likely to be any disturbances in the town, they all dined together
with Earl Fitzwilliam at the Hotel, and about nine o’clock in the evening this young
man was returning home and taking his horse to the stable, it threw him, and dashed his
head against a wall and so disfigured him, that altho it was close by his brother’s house that
it happened nobody knew him, and he was brought to an inn the next house to ours when
he was known by a mole which he had on his breast, he lived till twelve o’clock the
same evening although he never spoke or moved after he fell; he was buried with military
tarry honours: the family are all much afflicted which I do not in the least wonder at,
as he was a very nice young man.
My oldest brother Edward is at North Shields with Joseph Procter
a linen and woollen draper, he is bound for nine years, he likes his situation very well

my brother John is still at Ackworth School, so that there are but four of us at home, my
sister and I, and two little brothers, one about eight, the other six years old, they both go
to a school in the town. Cousin Jane Shillito was here last summer she spent a
week with us, she has four children two sons and two daughters, the oldest girl is at
York School. Please to give my dear love to thy sister Sarah I hope she is
quite well. I should should be much pleased to receive a letter from her, also one from
thee if agreeable, and shall esteem it a particular [insertion]favour [/insertion]if thou would send me a few pieces
of poetry, [insertion]which[/insertion] I am very fond of [deletion]it[/deletion] and having read some of [underline]thine[/underline] with particular pleasure
[deletion]and[/deletion] should like to see more of thy composition. I am joined by my mother
sister and brothers in dear love to thee thy husband and children
I remain thy affectionate cousin Sarah Carbutt.
