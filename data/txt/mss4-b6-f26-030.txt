My beloved Molly
I was rejoiced to hear by Elizabeth's note in
R. French's letter that both the Doctor & Elizabeth thot. thee
better, I hope thou wilt continue to mend it wd. be cause
of rejoicing to thy numerous enquiring friends here —
Joseph Grubb of Suir Island took me a one side after meeting
yesterday to tell me of a cure for thee, it succeeded when
all the Doctor's Recipes failed it was this, as much powdered
Saltpetre as cld. lie on a tenpenny piece disolved in
a tumbler of Cyder & water to be taken once a day
say in the evening for a while — & the patient was
restored — This is a very large Meeting several appearances
yesterday from young ministers — I am quite
puzzled to know what to do about Richd. Trench's business
I am afraid to wait till the meeting is over, for fear I shod. be
too late in declaring the tenants — for all our sakes I
hope thou wilt take good care of thy self, & not write or
read much to weary thee — & I hope you will all take
care to make my sister Sally as comfortable as you can
& as her situation requires, it shod be all our business
&

care to make each other [insertion]as[/insertion] happy & comfortable as we
can & certainly it is in our power to do so, & the retrospect
of having done so will in [insertion]the[/insertion] end afford solid
satisfaction — all the little children here are
well & fine lively, sensible children, so far as one can
judge-Mary Anne [deletion]Webb[/deletion][insertion]Labat[/insertion] is here, - Tell Elizabeth
that I promised Henry William's room for his manure
but not where Fitzsimmon's Potatoes were, but he
might put it out next to that part [deletion]of[/deletion] [insertion]in[/insertion] Gavin's Garden
[deletion]den where it[/deletion] but surely he may wait till I go home
I was thinking of going from this to Edenderry, &
returning here again, but I belve. it wd. be better to go
home first & go from thence to Ballitore — I would
be sorry to appear negligent of Richd. Trench's business
especially as he depends so much upon me — Give
my love to my sister Sally & Elizabeth Mary Doyle
& Abby — all of whom I hope to see soon —
thy ever affectionate
Wm Leadbeater
I dined at Jno. Wrights to day
with R. T. L — all kind &
all inquiring for thee —
The oilded Stuff that Sarah sent is
was is used for medical purposes as she was
told, but the oiled silk can be sent too -
