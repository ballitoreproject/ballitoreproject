Wendsday May 1828
Dear Sister,
I am rejoiced to hear
that you are to come in the next week &
I hope you wont make any excuse about
it. I s[insertion]u[/insertion]ppose Lucy told you we went
to see the model of Paris last night;
we were greatly pleased with it, & I
think it is well worth a shilling,
I hope you will go see it when you come
in. Frederick & I drank tea at my
aunt Gough's last night, & were very
much surprised to hear that Lucy was
there. Please send in, if you think of
it, the next time the car comes in,
Harry's Holiday the Peasants of Chamouni
& Atala as I always forget them.

I wish if you come in that we
could go to see Holyrood house.
Sarah brought Johnny to the artists in
Grafton St, but he said [insertion]he[/insertion] could not take
his likenss as he would not sit steady
enough. Johny was here this evening.
We have some very fine days

2
now here. Thursday. I have just
heard that Eliza is come in & tha
Frederick is to go out to morrow.
Alas! poor me I believe that I am
fated never to go out of a week day
but I suppose it is better for me
 to stay within. I hope I will see
you on Sunday at least. If F
goes out to morrow I intend to send
this with him. As I was looking
over my letters the other day I found
that I had only three of poor Emily's,
I thought that I had a great deal

more. Frank is just often popping
into the library to me, said something,
& off again with him. You may
see that I am very badly off for
something to say, but I cannot
help it.
I remain
your affectionate
brother
