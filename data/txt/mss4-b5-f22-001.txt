Copy of a letter from Edmund Burke to Mary Leadbeater
Dictated by himself & signed by his hand.
My Dear Mrs Leadbeater,
I feel as though to do your constant hereditary
kindness to me & mine. What you have heard of my
illness is far [insertion]from [/insertion] exag[insertion]g[/insertion]erated. I am, thank god, alive, & that is all.
Mastering to my dissolution , I have to bless providence
that I do not suffer a great deal of pain. I am very glad
to hear that the vexatious dispute which has been raised
against you about the few miserable trees ( of which [unclear]I [/unclear]
do not mistake I re[insertion]me[/insertion]mber the planting), is likely to be settled
to your satisfaction. I have never heard of any thing
so miserable as this attempt upon you.-
Mrs Burke has a tole[insertion]r[/insertion]able share of health in every respect,
except much use of her limbs. She remembers your Mother's
most good natured a[insertion]tt[/insertion]ention, as I am sure I do with
much gratitude. I have been[deletion]ever [/deletion] an admirer of
your talents & virtues, & shall ever wish most cordially
for every thing that can lend to your credit & satisfaction.
I therefore congratulate you very h[insertion]e[/insertion]artily on the birth of
your son, & pray remember me to the representative
of your family, who i hope still keep up the school.
of which I have so [unclear]serious [/unclear] a remembrance.
Tho' after so long an absence, & so many unpleasant
events of every kind that have distracted my thoughts
I hardly dare to ask for anyone[insertion] not knowing whether they all living or dead[/insertion] least I should be the
means of aw[deletion]e[/deletion]akening unpleasant recollections.
Believe me to be with the most respectful &
affectionate regard.
My dear Mrs Leadbeater
your faithful [insertion] friend [/insertion] & very humble servant
Bath
23 may 1797
Edmund Burke

PS: Pray remember me to Mr Leadbeater. I have been
at Bath for these 4 months to no purpose, I am there fore
to be removed to my own house at Beaconsfield
to morrow, to be nearer to a habitation more permanent
humbly & [insertion]peacfully [/insertion]hoping that my better part may
find a better mansion.
On the Death of Edmund Burke
'Tis o'er that lamp is quench'd in endless light,
which nature kindled at [insertion]her[/insertion] purest flame,
By science fann'd if science could enhance
a genius, from which science caught new rays.
No, 'tis not quench'd. the spark etherial lives,
And it shall blaze along the track of time,
While we, who joyed beneath the radiant beam,
shall mix unheeded with our kindred clay.
That star is set, [deletion]to shine [/deletion] on earth [insertion] to shine[/insertion] no more,
on which admiring nations wondering gazed.
That powerful foil stream of eloquence is dry,
Which with commanding force oerwhelmed the mind
And bore resistless down this rapid tide.

Such excellence is fled! - but public care
apart, in pensive solitude retired
Lamenting friendship drops[deletion] a[/deletion] [insertion] the [/insertion] silent tear.
There tender recollection calls to mind
The sweet benevolence which marked that mien,
That mien which unadmiring who could view?
'Tis her’s [deletion]which[/deletion] [insertion]with[/insertion] soft regret & pleasing pain
to trace the social & domestic scene,
Where, evershining most of all he shone.
He saw the liberal hand the healing [unclear]arms[/unclear]
Dispense unboasting [insertion]& [/insertion] to [deletion]a [/deletion] haggard eyes,
Redimme'd with pain & poverty, a care,

The vivid [deletion]hope [/deletion] rays of health & hope restore.
Th' unvarying friendship & the candid mind
Prompt to forgive & ready to attone
W[deletion]h[/deletion] ere his- and show close the tender ties
of Father, husband, brother bound his heart!
why droops that noblesoul. Alas! he mourns
a brother fate, companion of his [deletion]fate[/deletion] youth
By death relentless sever'd from his side.
Yet still remains that son, the only pledge
of a long happy union, & on whom
Paternal love had fixed [deletion]his[/deletion] [insertion]the[/insertion] ardent gaze
of fond, [unclear]purifying [/unclear] hope, from infant years
To manhoods ripened bloom. And now [unclear]retired[/unclear]
The illustrious father from [deletion] his[/deletion] the public scene,
And onward moved the son to fill [underline]his [/underline] sphere
on life's conspicuous stage. Ah what avail
Fame, youth & health, 'for Febris fiery dart
The throbbing temple ornate, & soon dislodge'd
from the frail, tenement the spark divine.
ablasted hopes. 'O bitter streaming tears
& childless parents, mourning oer the tomb.
Where duteous love cold, & unconscious lies
or hangs that filial heart had bled to heal.
The blow was struck, & lifes delights were o'er
three suns rolled joyless o'er that honoured head,
yet trembling hope with lonely fear surveyed
The opening scenes of p[insertion]e[/insertion]ace & rest secure,
where sorrows cease , & tears are wiped away;
For well that meek, that noblest wit knew
The meed nor fame nor genius dare demand:
Tho' great his claim on both, a higher claim,
Divine Philar trophy, he field on thee.
Farewell, O ever honoured, ever dear.
And long lamented, may thy matchless tongue,
Which never more shall charm celestial cars,
The immortal choirs of Hallelujah, rise .! —
