The Copy of a dream
Mary Brooks had in the beginning of the year
1776
Wherein she thought she saw the sky of a blue colour, as
in a serene summers evening on which small white clouds
formed words in verse of a considerable length, & were (she
thinks) a relation of all the remarkable Occurrences, that
have since happened in America: On her awaking the whole
was taken from her except the two first words of the two
first lines, which were the Kings name (George & England)
& alth'o she had a refreshing sense of the Lord's regard for
England, ye[unclear]t[/unclear] a fear seized her, least the Kings person
should be in danger, & this brought a weight & exercise over
her mind for about 8 days at the end of which one evening
her heart was melted under a foward sence of the flowings
of divine love, which brought great sweetness, Calmness,
& peace over her,[deletion]mind,[/deletion] [deletion]mind[/deletion], perfect stillness ensuing, she heard
the Lords voice (as distinctly as ever she heard any outward
Language) Pronounce the following words in the secret
of her mind. Viz. I will show thee things to come great

& mighty is the King of kings, the Lord of the whole Earth
by him kings reign, & princes decre justice. My power
shall subdue the Kings enemies, & he shall know that
I rule over the kindom's of men; thou hast seen his name
written on high, & the nation whom I will defend. No
enchantment against it shall prosper, nor divination
prevail. I will restore princes into her borders, & will
exalt my own name in the destruction of Hypocrites, for the
day of their Visitation is ended. Who have lifted themselves
up against my Providence, & the King that I have so
over them, & tho they swear the Lord liveth they swear falsly
