which I received in town.
I have just had a note from
Margt by the carts. I believe Grandmama
mama
in there to day - the latter having
come up from Dunlavin to day.
5th.. five O'clock and just
returned from a delightful
ride- but I must begin at
the beginning - This was a
lovely morning after all yester[unclear]day's[/unclear]
rain, and after breakfast
I went down with Richard &
Anna to Bray, as we were
returning we met Charlie
at the gate, he had come out
to ride in his horse which he
could not take in yesterday
on account of the wet.
So after dinner Philip and
I rode as far as Shanganagh
with [insertion]him[/insertion], and had as I said
before a very pleasant ride
indeed. To day a new
and Aunt Lucy dined
