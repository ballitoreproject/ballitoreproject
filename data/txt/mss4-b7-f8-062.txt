Waterford 27 March 1809
My dear Cousin
I confess I have exposed myself
to the imputation of ingratitude for so long deferring
this duty — procrastination has in the first
place been the cause & latterly embarrassment -
the situation of my pecuniary affairs has induced
me to enter into multiplied engagements
in the hope of extricating myself with
eclat which if I shall be spared for some
time longer I have no doubt of accomplishing
mean time some of my employers are
so urgent for the completion of their individual
objects that I am scarce allowed time to
collect my scattered thoughts. I hope the idea of
of offence is removed I can assure you that
far different sensations pervade my breast

It has given me much concern to learn the
melancholy state of Cousin Sallys sight I hope
that the care & attention administered to her
may preserve the one eye & that she may
be enable to bear her misfortune with resignation —
not yet collected the subscriptions I shall
exert myself as soon as I can make a little
leisure. The Books were received in good
order & all delivered except 2 or [unclear]3[/unclear] for which
I did not expect to be paid if not at the
time of delivery. I feel such an interest
in the publication that I can scarce open it
without the tenderest sensations the collection
I see is enriched by many pieces I never
met before most of which abound in pathos
& penetrate to the heart I have not had an
her case is very trying — I have

opportunity of knowing the sentiments of others.
I endeavoured to brush up my Latin a little by
looking into the Eneid I found I had still enough
left to discern sundry errors of the press. I am
glad something more is to be done for the
youth — their improvement & information has
certainly been more attended to of late years
than heretofore. I am pleased to hear even
the names of our old acquaintances mentioned
Ballitore seems to be more in the
gangway for an occasional visit I have seldom
had the opportunity here of an interview of the
kind I suppose my recollection would scarcely
serve me now to discern the features of those
I knew when boys. My wife joins me in best
wishes for you all
I am yours sincerely
William Rayner
