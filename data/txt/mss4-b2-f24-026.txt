My dear Father,

	I was favoured with thy exceedingly kind letter this morning, which afforded me great satisfaction, & at the same time affected me with sorrow on my poor, dear afflicted sisters account, her dear, eldest, little prattling Babe gone, Oh I wish it may be a dispensation that may renew her acquaintance more intimately with the Fountain of all true comfort, & solace her spirit with that joy which is better than of Sons & of Daughters, I have felt so close & near a tie of affectionate sympathy unite me to her, that I have wished to be near her in this trial; how kind it was of our dear Mother to be with her, I dont doubt but her company helped to support the minds of the afflicted Parents.
	We are greatly obliged by the free communication of thy sentiments to us: I suppose after Brother John had expressed himself as I wrote thee last, that having a tender conscience he was uneasy after, for two days after when I ^he^ came to town he took my Husband aside, & told him he was willing to give as long as lease as he chose, without any Clause but what himself was subject to, Sam told him with such a Clause as he had proposed he would not give him the ground rent for the House 16 per year. John answered, then their coming would be 24 per year, Sam said he did not say so, but one way it would be considered of Right, & the other of Friendship, John said, he believed he would not be an improving Tenant, & supposed he would make Merchandize of the House yet. When my Husband told me this I felt regret; for I had hoped by this to have got released from my present unpleasant situation, & to have retired into some quiet habitation, but as he again made this offer, I could not see how we could get away with honour, as it would unsettle Mother in a situation which she could find ^none^ so convenient for her in every respect elsewhere, & perhaps hasten her end with vexation, tho she would not own we were of any use to her, but she of much to us; in short it would fret & derange them all, my mind I own has been tossed & bewildered since this last affair, I have ardently wished to be freed from the perplexities attending my residence in this House, & yet I dare not force my freedom, or act contrary to the duty & tenderness due to an aged Parent. (She knows nothing of all this I believe.) We have been favoured in this place with innumerable mercies, mercies ancient & new, our dear little ones getting fine health, discovering that they are favoured with tolerable understandings, can be ruled by reasoning even to little Sally; our outward substance evidently increasing, so as to render us easy; & we in possession of a good business, my dear Husband & I happy in the true affection of each other, & above all a secret, hovering hand of Good seems at times made bare, so that at times I say, why are those favours granted? & again, I am abundantly favoured beyond my desert, let me endeavour to be more worthy, & more may be extended, & if I am too impatient to fly from some degree of suffering, worse may follow me, at other times I fret at trifles, & this is for want of having a greater watch kept up. My Uncle Benjamin & my Husband have settled it, & a lease is to be drawn immediately up as long as we chuse, Brother John seems friendly in his manner, & I hope all is over, & that I shall have no more disagreeable matters of this kind to send you, I sometimes blames myself for writing this last unpleasant dispute to you at all, but I hope it will go no farther. We were favoured with the company of our friends Thomas Ross, Hannah Bevington & Sally Stephenson this day at our meeting, the first was large in testimony, the second appeared also, the last silent, they had also an opportunity with my Mother, I think them valuable Gospel Ministers, the Women spoke much of the kindness they received at Ballitore, & of my Brothers attention to them, Poor Anne was so bad with the tooth-ache she was raving [?] almost all the time: they were here, she beged [sic] to have her tooth drawn, which we got done & she bore the operation stoutly, I think she had but the one bad tooth in her head, & it was a large one, the friends only called here, they dined at Uncle Bens. Molly Dudley is finely recovered, & suckling her infant. Aunt Taylor gets out to meeting & so does Mother.
	Hast thou heard that poor Johny [sic] Shaw is broke? his [sic] little Household furniture were canted [?] to help to pay his debts, I think its said he & his wife spent 80 in less than two years, I hear his wife is to go to service in Waterford, & he to go to Dublin to work journeyrank [?]. they [sic] have no Child. I hope to set off for Waterford next 7th day to our quarterly meeting.
	My dear love is to Ansels [?] Sparkes [sic], I am longing to see her, & would be glad of her company here to spend some time with us.
	My Husband joins in dear love to you all, & duty to thee & Mother, thy affectionate

My last letter I sent by Johny Taylor, who was to put into Castledermot post office, what did it cost?

[continues p. 5]

I was concerned to hear of poor, sweet little Richards bringing so much trouble on himself, if I had been there I should have suffered much on his account, & I think, his looking at the Child in the Water so unconcerned discovered more weakness & simplicity in the Child than archness or boldness, & that too severe correction is entirely improper for him, as many children appear weak at first, & as their understandings ripen & mature they may make bright Men. I do not know whether I am right, but thus it struck me: I would rather thou would not shew these ^remarks^ to his Parents.
	I suppose by this time poor Jane has taken the small pox, I long to hear of the welfare of the dear Child.
	It was Sally who fell down the inside Celler [sic] stairs.
	I shall take particular care of thy last letter.
