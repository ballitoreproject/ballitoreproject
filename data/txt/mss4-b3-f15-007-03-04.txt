Ballitore: 15/1 month 1767

Dear friend,

	+++ A new plantation (as dear Ruth Follows says) is coming up; may it come up erect & beautiful, & fruitful among the old trees, which have many of them lost the little greenness of their youth, & never came forward to bring forth much fruit! I have had a little hope that this will be the case, & my soul has been earnestly solicitous that I may not hurt the cause, even the great cause of Christianity in my short, & limited day, & age of the world in which my lot is cast. Neither is my wrestling confined to my own preservation only, but my strong cries are often in secret for my dear friends, who have favoured me with some degree of intimacy, that in their solitary sittings & sequestration from the false pleasures & deceitful spirit of the world they may feel their minds to be comforted and strengthened with the visits of divine Love, to the gladdening of their hearts in their pilgrimage, & encouraging them in the Lords work & service. I hope I am not forward to speak or write on such subjects beyond the bounds of that freedom which is [page number] 22 in the life: & I heartily desire ever to be preserved from it, but this I can say of a Truth (if from a person of so mean degree as I am it can be any encouragement to thee) my spirit has very often had near unity in religious fellowship with thee +++

	++ thy sincere affectionate friend
		Richard Shackleton
