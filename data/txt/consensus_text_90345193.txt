whole morning at his accounts -
and I think Philip followed his
example also - Lilly and I retired
to the drawing room to [underline]her[/underline] lessons -
We had early dinner as Papa went to town
by the 2/,, omnibus. No news yet
from Ned except the solitary newspaper.
Willie has not written to us this good
while but [deletion][/deletion] a Chillicothe paper
having arrived we concluded it
was from him.
20th.. A fine day - Drove down to Bray
with Liddy and the three children -
Saw J Perry jr. [deletion][/deletion] driving down the
town in a gig or tax cart. I think
Papa went down to the fair of Naas
to day, as he was intending to do so if
the day had been fine. He has
just now come out, so I am
mistaken - no I am not, he
[underline]did[/underline] go to the fair -
21st - Sixth day - Papa and Mama
went to town this morning.
