Paris - Hotel Wagram Rue de Rivoli
June 15th. 1850
My dearest Mother
I wrote to Martha enclosed
is a letter to Mary Henry the day before yesterday
and tho I have not a great deal to tell you I think
you will be better pleased at hearing pretty
often from us - Thos. has not been well these
two days - he was not out yesterday at all
nor the day before except to the post office
& money changers - I am very sorry to say
he has got a little cough after escaping it
all the winter - he was so oppressed with the
heat here one or two days that he put on
his cravat single & of course left his neck
more exposed than usual - wh. I think is
the way he got the cough - his Bowels too
have been out of order but that is such a
common thing with strangers coming
to Paris I did not feel uneasy - tho' of course
it is uncomfortable & causes a kind of lassitude
but this lassitude Thos. always has when [underline]any[/underline]
thing ails him - & I always wish to indulge
 it as the best means of cure - he says he is

not sick and I hope it will not signify
the weather these past two or three days has
been very Irish - last evening it blew almost
a storm for a while & the rain came on
in the night - today is fine - but cool and
cloudy - and I should not wonder if we had
showers - Emy & I make our way famously
about town - & I will try & make Thos.
keep quiet today also instead of coming
out with us - our first journey every
day is to the post office to try are there
letters & to post any we write - Thos. expects
a letter here from Dr Henry about the 19 or
20th - & we are not to leave this before that time
I believe - Please tell Martha to send us the
Daily News here directed to Thos. Elder Henry
Porte restante
Paris
as soon as you get this & to send it until we
let you know we are leaving this - I was very
near not getting her letter because she put [underline]Mrs[/underline]
on it - I hope I shall get a letter today as I am
beginning to get fidgetty about home - I hope
by making Thos. take rest and stay in the
house - he will soon be himself again - but it is
a great drawback to have him knocked up at all &
I only go out [insertion]without him[/insertion] in order that he may not feel that
he is preventing our seeing as much as we might.
It is not to make you uneasy & fret I am
telling you all this but to show you [underline]I hide[/underline]
[underline]nothing[/underline] & so leave nothing to your imagination
Emy got a little cold in London & had a cough
but has quite got rid of it since she came here
& seems very well - I trust Thos. will soon
be quite well too - we are generally pretty tired
at night being so much on foot all day - .
Every thing here seems dear & I do not think
there are as nice things to be seen in the shops
as in London - the people do not dress so
richly here either - the poor people are all
decent & tidy looking - no rags - & very few
beggars - the nurses & children seem to live in
the open air - in the [insertion]public[/insertion] gardens - the nurses work
whilst the children play about - we have seen
some people we know to be english but none
whatever that we were acquainted with.
If you or Martha have not written before you
receive this [underline]besure to write at once[/underline] & tell us

every thing about every one at home
I fully intended charging Martha in my last
to do so & in the hurry of getting ready for the
post forgot it I believe & I am afraid she will
not have written - so besure tell her to do so &
to send the newspapers there is no postage on
them - The rain has come on very heavily
but I suppose it will be only a shower - the
 sheets will be much pleasanter for it for
the clouds of dust yesterday were tremendous
& as disagreeable as it could possibly be in Ireland
Under the large trees in the Tullerie Gardens
opposite our windows the ground is still quite
dry & people sitting under them not heeding
the rain that is falling - The nice short grass
will be quite refreshed by it - it is astonishing
all the pains they take to keep it nice & fresh
in the dry weather the water Carts are ever at work
and I have seen them for hours together at one
small portion of the enclosed grass & flower
bed & borders - they seem to me to saturate one
part of the ground completely before they proceed
to another - the expense must be enormous -
