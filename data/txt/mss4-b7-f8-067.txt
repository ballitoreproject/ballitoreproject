Garrett Green 1 Sepr 1812
My dear Cousin,
On perusing yours of 29th Ultimo
I think I felt a parent's pang; as, when surrounded
by your amiable family, I considered them an addition
to my own flock: Deborah then in some
measure recovering from a melancholy languid state
appeared peculiarly interesting: believe me that
although the occurrence carries along with it nothing
disreputable in the eyes of the world I regret
much that any step is taken which has not
met the Sanction of her tender parents. It is
well for them who receive with gratitude every
favour presented by the great disposer of events
and can submit to the manifold trials we are
daily exposed to with resignation, endeavouring
to derive instruction even from the rod. I sincerely

hope the path for the young couple may prove
smooth although the entrance has not been completely
strewed with flowers. I should be happy
to see Elisabeth on her return which suppose
can only be the work of chance - if our next
removal should be Dublin & fortune faveur
there may be a better opportunity of cultivating
a friendly intercourse. I had a satisfactory
letter from Jos Johnson &fo the contents of which
I did intend to communicate & advise with you
before I wrote to them lest there should be any
variation from the conditions offered. Their letter
is under date 20 July, referring to your information
respecting the Treatise, & remarking the
impossibility of obtaining any opinion of its
merits without seeing it complete. They recommend
me as soon as I have made it as
perfect as I can to forward it to them

directed to No72 St Pauls Church-yard, when
if they should not have it in their power to
publish it themselves they will recommend it
to some respectable publisher in London. Since
receipt of this letter I have made as much
progress as I could, & if not retarded by
the approach of Sir Wheeler Caffe who is expected
to-morrow I could complete it in a few days
I have transcribed a duplicate that
I might have it in my power to shew
it to some acquainted with the science
after I have sent the counterpart to London
If I find it necessary & can accomplish a
trip to London I think it would ultimately
be a saving of expense in correction & when
I have finished I propose seeking a conveyance
from Waterford or Dublin. Richard joins me in
love to you & Cousin Sally he is much obliged for
the attention shewn him
Yours sincerely
William Rayner
