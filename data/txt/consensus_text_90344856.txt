get my parasol which was
left to be repaired and pay
the mighty bill of 1/3 for my
brooch, which I had broken,
thanks to Glengarriff.
After tea Papa and I came
out here as I wanted to be
with Polly, when Mama and
Lilly would go to Clonmel.
the latter did not look very
well, I do not think her cold
had quite gone.
15th.. Polly, Philip, and I went
to meeting, Philip bringing his
filly and driving himself.
Charlotte Pim was ready to
return with us, so having
called for her bag, we made
no delay home, tho' I
cannot say we went
very quickly. Charlie came
out, and I hope the day
in the country was of use
to him.
