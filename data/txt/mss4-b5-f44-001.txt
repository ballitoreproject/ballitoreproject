Peckham - near London - 4th month 4th
My dear friend
Thy truly kind and acceptable communications
of 9th 2nd month, reach'd me at a time when
leisure to examine papers, as select the justly valued
letters of thy beloved father and my endear'd friend,
was not altogether at my command, being not only
involved in much mental exercise, and struggling
with considerable bodily weakness, but, from a very
arduous engagement, necessarily more in London than
at home, indeed, to avoid the fatigue attendant on
a distant residence, my dear E.D. and I accepted
a kind invitation from a friend in Devonshire
house quarter, and made his house our home for
several weeks - I did not pass through such an
engagement without considerable difficulty, and
same interruptions to even usual health, least have
reasons to acknowledge gracious support every way
while sitting in about 133 families as religious

opportunities

opportunities, beside the regular attendance of settled [unclear]meetings [/unclear]
and appointment of several [deletion]others[/deletion] among friends and
others, some more similar engagements remain in
[underline]our[/underline] view, but, while I have never rank'd as a [underline]quick[/underline]
mover, I am now, from age and increas'd debility,
of necessity a very [underline]slow[/underline] one, and intervals of [underline]rest[/underline]
are become indipensable - in one of [underline]these[/underline] am preparing
to forward to thy care my dear friend, the
much-values letters solicited, without any restriction,
but what - an examination - thy [unclear]ones[/unclear] at my beloved Sally
prudence may suggest -- knowing assuredly that it is
only as a [underline]Loan[/underline] they are sent, for I wish [underline]such[/underline]memorials
of such a highly valued friendship, to descend
to my dear Daughters, when I have measured the days
of a pilgrimage, lengthened far beyond expectations, and
which has been, and continues to be, mark'd with
many and various successes -- the last edition of the
"memoirs" is in my possession, and very [insertion]as increasingly[/insertion] valuable are
the contents made, by the addition of various letters,

not inserted in the first publication - I convers'd with
Saml. Darham lately on thy prospect of another volume,
and inform'd him, thou wast collecting from some correspondents
preparatory to printing, he observ'd, that,
while there could be, as he admitted, no doubt, of
such a work being likely to meet approval, that as
the last edition might take some time to go off,
it might be proper not to hurry another, which
suggestion perhaps may have reach'd thee from their
home, yet I thought my mentioning it would do no
harm --- I wish I could have added to the numbers
of letters, by presenting from others, indulg'd as I
was, but tho' keeping the subject in view, and opening
it to a few friends, nothing has resulted from it
but expressions of approbation, that so much as had
been, and what remain'd to be publish'd, had been
preserv'd - I sensibly regret that by some means - perhaps
by not being able to put together [insertion]most [/insertion] valued papers
in the hurry sometimes attendant on removals - the
precious documents, now [unclear]abt.[/unclear] being sent have been
(injured,
and it has reconciled me more to what might appear delay in me

[underline]in appearance,[/underline] but I hope very little of the traces of
his beautiful pen are wanting, at least, that then my
dear M. L. may easily supply, when extracting, [underline]all[/underline]
that may be requisite --- I cannot give a sentiment with
clearness, in reference to the full names of correspondents
being given, thy own judgment ye can best determine, on
my [underline]own[/underline] accnt., while I was humor'd by such testimonies
of Christian and affte. regard, I should almost shrink from
appearing to sanction [insertion]such[/insertion] sentiments of partial friendship
as are envinced in some of these letters, for truly my deer
friend, I am so sensible of weakness, deficiencies, and even
multiplied errors, [underline]so much[/underline] calling for forgiveness - [underline]so little[/underline]
wherein I can rejoice - that I think I could never [underline]more[/underline], or
so fully, utter from my heart the language "unto [underline]me[/underline]
belongeth nothing but blushing" &c &c - than at the present
period - I wish not however to lay any restriction, but
yield the disposal of these sweet relics into thy hand -
- It was very kind in thee to give us so interesting a
sketch of thy more immediate connexions, thy dear Children,
natural and adopted, have, with there beloved parents,
my love and best wishes for their temporal and spiritual
good --- my precious S. S. must not blame, but pity her
[unclear]poor[/unclear] old friend, who, if she wrote to her, [insertion]as[/insertion] often as she thinks
of her, would make a considerable demand upon her [unclear]house[/unclear],
my love is [underline]warm[/underline] and [underline]unabated[/underline], and she can never partake
