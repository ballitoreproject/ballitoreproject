Dublin Oct 24 th 1838
My dear Elizabeth
I am afraid unless the
[unclear]Medm Lewler[/unclear] chooses to repair her house 
a little before winter that she will have
to suffer from the [unclear]caet[/unclear]. We are out
willing to lay out any more on the [unclear]the othe[/unclear]
house this year. I find upto this
date that the whole [unclear][/unclear] must
be balanced by the very side of the
Profit & Loss acct. H seems almost
as tho' the doing one thing produced
application to have others done.
I suppose you do not often
Lee Richard when you do will you
tell him I got his letter which
I intend answering shortly and
Settling at same time all about
prices of goods, got here to his satisfaction
I wish you would take a run up
in the coach and eat your apples & nuts with 
us I think you are under promise so come
and give us a surprise yours affections it E B

Elizabeth Leadbeater
