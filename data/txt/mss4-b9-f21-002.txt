My dear lucy
I had a note from Edw this morning saying
he will come with my mother this eve I believe
my mother expects to be met in Kilcullen by you [insertion]for[/insertion]
Edw desired me to send the car to Dundavin for
him - We do not expect the Stradbally people
they are to come some day after Jas & Lydia
[unclear]come [/unclear]which I suppose will not be till 2nd day
so I do not expect thee sooner than 3[unclear]d[/unclear]
of 4th day Eben is not well yet but is
better I fear I cannot see you this evening
I shall send margt if I cannot go myself
thy SB
