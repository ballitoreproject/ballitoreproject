Rose - Good morrow Anstis. Why are you
milking the cow so late?
Anstis Because I went to bed tired after the
days diversion & neither Tim nor I awoke till
8 o clock
Rose - Well Anstis We always get up earlier
on Monday morning then any in the week
It is a pleasent time to begin any fresh job of
work & one is so rested all Sunday
Anstis - The never a one in our house rests
neither cat nor dog nor any one else
Rose - How do you manage to be all tired -
Anstis - Why in the morning we take a good sleep
& then Tom hurried to have breakfast over & myself
& the children drest for prayers - & Tom bothers me for
a button or a string or to draw up a hole in his stocking
And then we must run every foot of the way
& are often late after, & then we are smothering
in the crowd after running so fast, so that we can't
think of prayers - So we hurry home to dress a

bit of meat for Tim [unclear][/unclear] a bit of a Sunday so
I [unclear]toil[/unclear] at that & the children run wild when there
is no school & pester me looking for them - All
the evening we do be roving here & roving there
I lock the cabin & many a good cock & hen we lose
on Sundays & the children set the cat & dog to fight
so there is nothing but hubbub from morning till
night & Tim scolding us all by turns if he went
to walk or play or drink like another man. & not
stay watching us it would be much pleasanter
Dear me but I hate a cross man - When he is in
a hearty humour of a fine Sunday evening I make
him take a walk to a [unclear]standing[/unclear] & treat us all
to tea & cakes, then we are so tired we can hardly
strip ourselves to go to bed & can hardly waken
in the morning, nor indeed we dont care to work
so soon after such diversion
Rose - If you like Anstis I'll tell you how we
pass our Sundays - We rise near as early as
usual & ready up the place before breakfast
that we may have time to do as I'll tell you all day

after breakfast we have plenty of time to dress
because our little clothes are mended & laid out
over night - Jem & I always think it a pleasant
walk to the chapel & [deletion]endeavour to be[/deletion] do our
endeavour to be in time for Mass - We advise
the children to mind what is said & to attend to their
duty while they stay there because it is very bad
to divert themselves or their thoughts at a time when
they say they go to worship - they know that we always
took care of them & listened to their little complaints
& [unclear]tend[/unclear] them if we could, nor never was fond of
crossing them so they [deletion]would be for stern[/deletion] are for being
after us wherever we go, & if they teaze us sometimes
yet on the whole it is a great ease to know they are
safe & with them that wont ill advise them - As to
our bit of dinner, we like a bit of meat too on Sunday
& I have it ready boiled on Saturday as we dont like
to make slaves of ourselves or our children on the day
of rest - indeed we boil our handful of potatoes & always
enjoy ourselves in quietness over our bit of clean good
victuals

for which we are very thankful & advise the children
to be so, or if a bit was left Jem always likes it
to be sent to our old neighbour, indeed the children
would sooner [unclear]stikt[/unclear] themselves than let her be disappointed
& they all wish to carry it to her - Sometimes
we take a [deletion]little[/deletion] [insertion]bit of a[/insertion] walk in the evening or sit at the door
playing with the children or call to see a neighbor, but
we always read a good book out loud for an hour &
we have little books teaching goodness that we
lend to the children that can read, So our evening
passes away in sweetness & I hope we are the better
of it, for it is not good to be always thinking of work
no more then diversion, it makes us too worldly
minded & as to feasting & drinking it is neither
good for Soul or Body
Anstis Myself would fall asleep with so much
reading -
Rose - If you gave your mind to it you'd be sorry
when it was done, & its' often we cry with joy
when we read [deletion]of[/deletion] the sweet sayings of the dying
& all the joy they expect - We cant but pray to be
like them
Anstis - Well I would not be bound to pass such a sunday for
all that, it being the only day we have of our own
Rose It is the Lords day & we have a right to think of
him on its so as every day, but this in particular & we ought
to be proud that there is a day of rest for our bodies & that
we can prepare ourselves for here after
