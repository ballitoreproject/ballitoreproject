Dear Cousin
	+++The satisfaction I reap from thy correspondence makes me desirous that the wheel on my side should not be clogged with delay. Tis not indeed in our power to qualify our own spirits in order to write with propriety on the most solemn subject: but where Truth has cemented seasoned & united minds by its virtue, there is often a freedom of intercourse which rather tends to good, if not to much degree of edification. If the face of a man (the bare sight of him) sharpens his friend; why may not his letter, though of little intrinsic value, have somewhat of like effect?
+++It would have been very pleasing to have met with thee at Mountrath: but perhaps it was as well for W. to come. People much engaged in business, for relief of both body & mind, require some respite from it, & it is well when these excursions, necessary for health, are at the same time productive of spiritual advantage. This is rightly mixing the utile dulci [sic]. I do not know what report W brought you home of the meeting. Some of our general meetings seem to have been attended with a greater & more constant degree of life than this, yet I believe it was not entirely destitute of it. I think it may be well sometimes, as it were, cursorily to interrogate young folk a little how they fared at their return from such opportunities, when they are generally more communicative on such topicks, though from the disuse of speaking about such matters, or the solemnity attending them, they may not make an answer of much intelligence, yet it sets them a thinking & pondering, & promotes a [page number] 148 kind of acquaintance with good things. How raw [?] do we see many people, young & old, in cities & families, for want of having a little discourse among them now & then, as Truth would open the mind, upon the most interesting subject! Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh, & the heart being set on this world & its [sic] profits, or pleasures, the conversation generally runs in that line. The great Promulgator of the Jewish dispensation was sensible of the important advantages accruing from the impression of religious discourses, delivered as it were en passant, when he not only enjoins as a duty that the chosen people should teach the statutes diligently to their children (formally instruct them therein) but inculcate them in a more cursory manner (doubtless under the restriction of a proper freedom of spirit) by the frequency of ordinary conversation: Thou shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thy ^thine^ house, & when thou walkest by the way, & when thou liest down, & when thou risest up. +++
	I am, dear Joseph,
		very affectionately thine,
