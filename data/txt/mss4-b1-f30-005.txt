About 20th. of 3d mo: 1752, I dreamed that R. Lecky & I were sitting
in a Room, & in Conversation he told me that there was an Infection
in Dublin amongst the People, & many had it, but none died;
that they had a very strong Smell, or bad Savour. I asked him did
he ever hear of a small fish that went before the Shark, as if it
gave Warning that the devouring Shark was near, which destroys
gave warning that the devouring Shark was near, which destroys
all before it. Even so will that come which will destroy all it seizes
on: & as sure as I tell thee, so sure it will come to pass - I thought
in a little time, I was in a Coach, going to Meeting, & that I was
to warn Friends of it; but when I consider'd my Weakness, I
thought I cou'd not stand up, nor deliver it loud enough for so
large a Meeting. However, I was to go up in to the Gallery, & the
large a meeting. However, I was to go up into the Gallery, & the
meeting was so still & attentive that all might hear -
It was also in my mind that I should be at rest & in my
place, before this happened, & that it would be soon after.
So I awoke.
