Dear Mary Leadbeater
I rec'd thy note this morning abt
wool - if fleece wool I fear I cannot obtain the
small quantity wanted, previous to [unclear][/unclear] of thine
I had bought 3 3/4 lamb wool a 18d intended for thee
as I had forgotten the commission - and thought the
wool wanted was [insertion]to be[/insertion] fine for stockings - if this will not
answer will keep it for our own use
Three of our boys Jams. Jno & Edwd had all been complaining
a little & we were a good deal alarmed
abt. the first & had Doctr Ryan (Kilkenny) to see him
twice - who happened to be here visiting Dr Maharg
his illness continued but 2 or 3 days & the three are now
as well as usual - and our friend Maharge daily increasing
strength poor Harriet & all his numerous
friends were greatly alarmed we now hope his valuable
life will spared a little longer - this is the 4th attack of
fever he has had within a few years & every year seems
to have [unclear]made[/unclear] considerable waste on his delicate frame
Sally & [unclear]Barcroft[/unclear] next door continue convalescent tho' both
weakly Thine affy
