To the deaf & dumb at Claremount
[deletion]When the[/deletion] [insertion]ye whose[/insertion] closed ear repels the power of sound,
[deletion]And[/deletion]Midst [insertion]whose[/insertion] unconscious tones the voice is drown'd
Bless [deletion]be[/deletion] the patient, generous toil which brought
To [deletion]the[/deletion][insertion]your[/insertion] uncultur'd wilderness of thought
A light to chase the gloom with cheering ray,
And useful arts to clear the tangled way.
[deletion][/deletion][insertion]How[/insertion] sweet to see on Claremount's beauteous brow
Nature & Taste their gifts united pour
[deletion]But is sweeter to behold[/deletion] oh, how sweet to see connubial love.
Amid these shades, a blessed inmate more.
Yet sweeter even than these it is to find
From clouds emerging the expanding mind
Beam thro' the smile, & lighten up the eye,
While active signs the use of speech supply
And the free pen displays the thoughts which rise
From earth's low valley to the [deletion]eternal skies[/deletion] [deletion]approving (or pitying)[/deletion] highest skies
From earth's low valley to the [deletion]eternal skies[/deletion][deletion]approving (or pitying)[/deletion] highest skies
While by the sacred lore of christian love
What [deletion]seem'd[/deletion] [insertion]once[/insertion] misfortune [insertion]seemd[/insertion] [deletion]now[/deletion] may [insertion]now a[/insertion] blessing[deletion]s[/deletion] prove
