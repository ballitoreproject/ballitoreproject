Woodbank, 6th Mo. 24th 1819.
Dear Sarah,
I intended answering thy
kind note before I left Dublin, but
found myself more pinched for time
than I expected. - I have not, nor
do I expect, the privilege of seeing all
thy letters to Eliza Gough, the privilege
of receiving lines now & then from
thee I esteem a great privilege with
which I ought to be satisfied. I
have heard, however, parts of thy letters
to E. Gough, to which, I hope, thou
has no objection. - Dublin is [underline]not[/underline] the
fountain of all knowledge - but is the
fountain of a great deal of prejudice, error
& vice, which it shares in common
with all large cities. - It is not easy
for man any where to see his way
Sarah Leadbeater

aright, but the mist around him is (I
know by experience) much thicker in
cities than in the country. - It is artificial
life he sees there, an artificial
world
"Where works of man are cluster'd close around,
And works of God are scarcely to be found."
I thought thy question about wisdom referred
to some previous parley on the subject
with L. Barrington; but I thought it
no harm to give thee a few hints on the
subject, tho' the question was not directed
to me. - Cowper's definition of wisdom is
not in his Conversation, it is in the last
book of the Task
"Knowledge & Wisdom, far from being one,
"Have oft-times no connection, Knowledge dwells
"In heads replete with thoughts of other men
"Wisdom in minds attentive to their own
"Knowledge is proud that he has learned so much,
"Wisdom is humble that he knows no more."
I have left out some which I cannot
remember. - I am glad to hear you are so
comfortably settled at Bray, I hope Deborah
will derive advantage from sea-air water
& exercise. - I am enjoying myself
here as I expected among a people
simple in their manners & uncommonly
hospitable & kind. - My uncle Christy
has latterly been ailing with a complaint
in his stomach, at which his
friends are a little alarmed. He
speaks of going to Dublin next week
(if he find himself well enough) with
my cousins [insertion]Sally Christy &[/insertion] Hannah Dawson, & from
that to Limerick, & after leaving [deletion]he [/deletion][insertion]H. Dawson[/insertion}
there, he intends going to Cork, & returning
by Ballyhealy & Ballitore. - It is
not likely that I shall visit Ballitore
before I leave Ireland, as James cannot
meet me there as I expected. - If I
can, [deletion]I[/deletion] however, I will go to see
you at Bray. - Farewell, hoping we
soon may hold verbal or rather oral conversation
