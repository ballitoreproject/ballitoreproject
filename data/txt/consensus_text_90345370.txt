Papa turned his ancle - Company to dinner on 1st day -
Florence here -
x 7th.. Seventh day - Papa turned his ankle
x 7th.. Seventh day - Papa turned his ancle
again to day coming down the steps
of the bridge - it gave him great
pain at the time, but it seemed
not to affect it very much afterwards
x 8th.. First day, Philip and I went to
meeting, and brought back Florence
[insertion]Uncle Arthur[/insertion] and Jemmy Perry. John came out
also by the one O'clock train, and
Neilson Handcock by a later one, just
in time to be late for dinner, which
was a pity. The gentlemen predominated,
Florence she staid the night.
9th.. Papa and Florence went to town
by the eleven train - I went down
with them to the Station. After
dinner as Mama was going to take
the children a drive, I thought I
might as well ride - so a fine
cavalcade of us, set off to the [underline]strand[/underline].
October
it was well we had
