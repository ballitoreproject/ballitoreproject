Brother and Sister and Cousins I Recived a Letter from the

of us and his friends in his going to Bentham to

Bought [insertion]the[/insertion] goods of and he had other of them a man to prize

is lining and wooling Cloth and Stufs for womens Clothes and
grosrys which will require a consideralble Stock Sister Anna and
