September 1807
My dear Friend, Above I trouble you with a Dct. (which being dated from
no place, is [underline]supposed [/underline]to be drawn within 10 miles of London, & therefore not
requiring a Stamp) & intreat the favor of you to pay Mr. S. Bewley the
balance of Â£5. pound. 9s. 8d due to him on the Swindling acct. - & the remainder will
pay 2 Subscriptions for your Poems, one for Mrs. H. Bowdler Park Street
Bath the other for myself- I am unfortunately out of the [underline]reading [/underline]
World here, & therefore cannot do what I wish for you_ If the English
Bookseller has Mrs. B's & my direction sent to him, he will of course order
his Correspondent at Bath & Kendal to deliver them_ - I will beg the
favor of Mr. Bewley to write me a line acknowledging the final close
of the account between himself & Mr. Smith. - Now having dispatch'd
the matter of business between us, which should have been done before
if I had not in vain expected a Frank, - I will talk of other things -
As I hold your Character in too high estimation to suspect you of
fickleness, I am always satisfied there is some good reason for your
silence,

I am always happy to hear from you, but never doubt the continuance
of your friendship when I do not. I am sorry I cannot at present fulfill
either of my promises, - the want of a Cover or two prevents the sending
learned directions for cutting out your Shifts; & all my Angel Daughter's
[insertion]papers[/insertion] are now with Mrs. Bowdler, who (in confidence I tell you) means to publish
[deletion]them[/deletion] some of them, with a little account of their Author - Mrs. B. has more
than once desired I would request your permission for [deletion]publishing[/deletion] [insertion]introducing[/insertion] some
of the Stanzas of the elegant Poem you address'd to me,- but I have always
declined asking you, by telling her you were going to publish yourself -
her last answer (now before me) says, "I still think Mrs. Leadbeater would take
the request as a compliment, & I am convinced it would essentially forward the
sale of her book in England" - having given you the opinion of Mrs. B., I leave
you, dear Friend, to say yea, or nay, as you judge proper, - only entreating
that no considerations of civility to myself, may be taken into your decision.
I perfectly agree with you that there is an originality & [underline]pure Simplicity[/underline] / not
such as Wordsworth [underline]affects[/underline]) in all our worthy Favorite Thos. Wilkinson writes,
especially in his prose, which is to me delightful, - I have his permission to

publish a letter, & sometimes he composed on dear Bessey's death, which are beautiful!
especially the [underline]latter[/underline] which must affect a heart of Stone, - but he will
not allow his name to appear, or the very short & simple account which I gave
of him in a letter to Mrs. B. He is a most excellent Being, & the more I know
of him, the more highly I esteem & regard him. - I have never met with Miss
Owenson's works, I am not in general fond of Novels,- not even your favorite
Miss Edgeworth's, I thought her Leonora very defective in Morality, or rather
in [underline]Religion[/underline], which is a subject she avowedly meddles not with, & I am sick of
Morality unconnected with its best support.- - If you recollect her Hero in
Leonora, notwithstanding the solemn, sacred Marriage Vow - still thinks himself
bound in [underline]honor[/underline] to an infamous Woman, & resolves to [underline]act[/underline] on that principle,
altho' his affection & high opinion of his Wife remain unchanged, the moment
he learns his Mistress has [underline]ridiculed [/underline]him, the slender thread of Honor snaps,
& he then thinks himself free from all engagement, & at liberty to return
to his amiable Wife - perhaps you will (like my friend
Abraham) think me a [underline]Bigot[/underline] for saying Miss Edgeworth meddles
not with Religion, but I had the authority of a near Relation of hers, who strongly
approved its being entirely omitted in the System of Education Miss E. published,
& declared it was [underline]purposely[/underline] omitted, because there was such a
diversity of opinions on the subject - Understand me rightly, dear Mary,
I am not contending for the faith of any [underline]one Sect[/underline], but I do contend that
Morality without Religion, is like State Policy - which gives way to the plea
of [underline]Necessity[/underline]. You will perceive that I am not satisfied with our late [underline]success[/underline]
as it is call'd,- in Denmark. We reverse that noble Christian principle of
doing as we wod. others shod. do to us,"- & [underline]do [/underline]what we suppose Bonaparte wod. do
to us, - but I would no more take him for my Guide, than for my Governor.
Have you read "Letters from the Mountains, by Mrs. Grant? as you are partial to
the Scotch, I think you will like them, but get the 2d. Edition. I have too, been much

pleased with Mrs. Chapone's posthumous works, lately publish'd - I am not acquainted
wth. Mrs. West, but some of my Friends are, & speak highly of her. I think her novels
(which are the only works of hers I have read) are amongst the very best, "Thaddeus
of Warsaw" by Miss Porter is a very good one - I am almost at the end of my paper,
without answering your queries. Kitty has a little Boy, & Turpin goes in Jan.y to
attend her 2.d confinement. Ju: is better - Louis was at home 5 days this summer, is
grown stout & as bold as a Lion,- his Nerves have been tolerably fry'd by the blow.g
up of the Ajax close beside him, the destruction of the Turkish fleet & the repassing the
Dardanells, all of which Sir J. Duckworth says "he stood most wonderfully" - I have had
no little anxiety lately for Bedfor (my 3d Son) he is in the Carbineers, & was at the disastrous
attack of Buenos Ayres, but as he is not named in the list of the kill'd, or wounded,
I trust he is still number'd with the living. I expect the Capt.n every day, he is to have
a recruit.g Party at Kendal, so that his head quarters will be here. Turpin begs me to
say all that is proper for her, but I cannot persuade her to say she will take your advice
& follow M. & A Doyle's excellent example. - I fear she will certainly marry a Man 15yrs.
younger than herself! "oh Frailty thy name is Woman", I rejoice that ye are all going on
so well.- I beg to be very kindly remember'd to all my Friends - & assure you that I am very affectly JM
[underline]Ireland [/underline]
Mrs. Leadbeater
[underline]Ballitore [/underline]
I hope you fulfill yr. promise of burning all my scrawls.
pray ansr. me soon abt. the Poem- - Farewell! Mrs. Keating
is still here [insertion]in this country[/insertion] her Daur. & Mr Kearney at Keswick, where she has lately
had a 2d. child- -
