By William Smith a Vision.
About 15 Years ago, I was coming from a meeting of the People
of God with the others of my Friends we called at a Friends house, where
we had something to Drink; but whether I drank any thing or not I
can not tell; but immediately I was as one departed out of the Body,
I was taken up by Friends, & carried to bed; so lay most of the Night;
not knowing whether I was dead or alive, in which time I saw great
& marvellous things, which I believe in time may come to Pass I saw
a mighty day coming wherein the People of God were like to suffer great
persecution & they gathered them together in great Numbers & their Persecutors
seemed to be with out number[deletion]s[/deletion] for Multitudes, with Horses oxen &
Carts they were preparing fu[insertion]e[/insertion]l for the fire upon a Large moor[deletion]e[/deletion] with
stakes & all things ready for executing the said People of God; &
I heared a Voice Crying: "You that abide in"my my power & rock of my
safety I will preserve "you in the pavilion of my rest in safety for
evermore" And I also heard a great cry amongst the multitude,
that the earth rang, cying the Day is our own; we will Root them
& destroy them from the earth, there shall not one of them Remain,
upon which I heard another Voice saying, Fire seen Fire seen, it
is enough & Immediately there arose a great Whirlwind & Swept
the said multitude away, & not one of them was left & the People
of God were set at liberty, & likewise I beheld, & Lo thousand
upon thousands yea an Innumerable multitude which were Persecutors
of the Said People of God standing on the Moore, & also of
the People of God a great number but much less than the other,
at a Distance the one from the other; & the Lord said unto his
Enemies, I will Pour my wrath upon you & my Judgments shall
come upon you & none of you shall be able to avoid it; "for where-ever
they went it was with them, cursing the Day [insertion]that[/insertion] ever they were born
I also beheld them that Kept not the Faith but turned back in
the Day of Trial, & lo! their Punishment was greater than [insertion]that of[/insertion] the
Persecutors & amongst the People of God that stood faithful I
heard a most sweet & heavenly harmony. And when the Enemies
of the Lord beheld that the joy of the People of God increased,
their Plague & anguish increased also untill they were all Consumed;
& after this I saw a great & terrible Earthquake & I saw
the houses of their Worship all Sunk to the Earth so that no

Man ever after that would go into them: & after that I beheld
the People of God in great Prosperity Praising & magnifying
of God for their great & wonderful deliverance & as far as I saw were
never more troubled by the Persecutors, this I saw about 18 years
ago & it hath often come upon my view to write, yet not written
till this 6th of the 1st.. Month 1685 by me
