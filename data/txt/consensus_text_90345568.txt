and as I gazed at the ever flowing
river below and [insertion]at[/insertion] [/insertion] those [unclear] ruined [/unclear]
ivied walls, and thought of the
former inhabitants, long since
silent as they, dead and forgotten
a strange melancholy feeling stole
over me and I could have mused
and mused for a long time
had I been alone -
Owing to some little circumstance
I am very unhappy aye heart sick
oh! the weary weary feeling - when
will it depart, when shall I again
be at ease: and yet who has so much
reason to be thankful, gay, and
cheerful - I who have so many
kind friends, so many blessings,
so [underline]much[/underline] to be grateful for, Alas!
alas! it is I fear [underline]all[/underline] my own fault.
I got two letters and three newspapers
this morning, one of the former was
from Philip - a pleasant surprise
for I expected not one from him.
We took a stroll after dinner with
Hannah Pim. Mr "Bland"
alias Mr Martin took his departure this
morning
