Dialogue 6th
Jupiter, AEsculapius & Hercules.
I. Leave off, AEsculapius & thou Hercules,
quarrelling with one another like
men, for these things are indecent & different
from the banquet of the Gods. H. But
Jupiter wilt thou suffer this quack to sit
above me. AE. For indeed I am better, H. How
thou thunder stricken fellow is it because Jupiter
struck thee doing unlawful things with
[insertion]his[/insertion] thunder-bolt. But now the 2nd.. time thou art
made partner of immortality thro', mercy,
AE. Hast thou forgot likewise to be scorched
in AEta seeing thou puttest me in mind of fire.
H. Have we done like & similar things in
the course of life & I who am the son of Jove
but I sustained so many labours, purging
life overcoming wild beasts & punishing
quarrelsome men, but thou art a cutter
[deletion]of [unclear][/unclear][/deletion] & gatherer of herbs; & chance
being useful to sick persons by applying
medicines but exhibiting nothing
manly. AE. Thou sayest truly because

I cured thy burnt blisters when thou camest
up half burnt & corrupted in thy
body by both first the shirt* & after by
the fire. But if I did nothing else
I was not a slave as thou wert neither
did I clothed with purple card
woolin Lydia & being beat by Omphale
with a golden sandal nor mad did I
kill my children & my wife. H.
If thou dost not leave off to upbraid
thou shalt soon see that thy immortality
will not profit thee much when I
shall cast thee headlong from heaven
so that Paeon himself cannot cure
thy broken skull. I. Leave off I say
& donot disturbe our assembly
otherwise I will turn you both
from the banquet. And indeed
Hercules it is just that AEsculapius
shoud sit above thee because
he died first.

Dear Cousin
I reced thine with promise
of forgiveness provided I be a
good boy but if I misbehave
again I must expect punishment
due to my crime.
I'll be as stiff as thou art
stout & tell thee that we boys (viz.
(I (AE. & I.) have not as much time
to write as (you) idlers & will
not any more submissively
beg pardon in my epistle
to thee
I am thy [deletion][/deletion] [insertion]roused[/insertion] cousin
