The Beauties of Nature
What is more beautiful and interesting than the
works of Nature; with how much regularity
are they formed, and with how much uniformity
they perform their duties, Everything seems
to be fitted to its place and condition Bodies
Celestial as well a Terrestrial, the work of which
none but an Almighty being ever could accomplished.
How entertain[insertion]in[/insertion]g it is to view the heavenly
Bodies, as they are performing revolutions daily
and yearly. And how plasing [deletion]it is[/deletion] to see the
sun that great giver of light and heat to the
whole universe; and seeming by the daily revolution
of the Earth to be constantly revolving it. While on
the contrary he is at rest and other heavenly bodies
are completing revolutions annually around him.
and as he enlightens the moon planets and stars
they reflect their light to the Earth presenting
a beautiful and sublime prospect.
As we look upon the works of Nature, we see the
vast Ocean hurling its ponderous by the stormy winds,
to and fro from their capacious. bed. and over it the
Marriner is guiding his noble ship on to the destined
port. Both Earth and sea proclaim the hand of their
great Creator.
