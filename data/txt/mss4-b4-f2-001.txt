Whitby 9th: of 3d mo. 1766.
Dear Uncle.
I thought it my Place to acquaint thee that I
rec'd a Letter from Nathl. Bell dated 6th Inst. who writes
Our Dear friend Roger Shackleton has been for a
considerable time very feeble but walked about a little,
and attended our Meeting twice last first Day save one,
Since that time he grew weaker & continued so, till this
Morning about 11 o'Clock, when he departed this life,
I am persuaded in a comfortable Frame of Mind,
having in this his last Illness been highly favoured
wth: the divine presence, which he had to express divers
Times, to some of his Friends who visited him -
As I had not seen Father of some time before he died
I thought proper to give thee N Bell's above Accot. & hope
we may all Rest satisfied, he has finish'd well - he
made a Will some Years ago, the Contents of which I
have not yet heard - My Wife, Son Roger &
my eldest Daughter are now at York to attend the
Funeral, this Afternoon - I hear Aunt Ford continues
feeble & much as she has been for some time - please
to remember me affectionately to Cousin Richard & his
Family, & should be glad at any time to hear of your
Welfare - accept my tender of Dear Love to thy Self
& Aunt (tho' unknown)
Thy Loving Kinsman
