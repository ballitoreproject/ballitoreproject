My much loved friend.
Truly thou has repaid me many
times over, by the generous proof of affection which
was gratefully received on 4th day - after our reduced
& last meeting had broken [insertion]up[/insertion] at E. Grubb's house. My valued
Aunt M. G. had lodged with us previously, She was under
the influence of one of her bilious attacks which prevented
her attending our mo. meeting yesterday - she spent last
night uncomfortably, but was able to join us at
dinner to day. I had thought of addressing thee on the
receipt of the affecting tidings from London which has
deprived us of a near a faithful friend & relative, but
we were daily hoping for further particulars which
only this day were ours [unclear]perused[/unclear] by my deeply affected uncle
John. & knowing thou to be most sincerely participating with
us. I shall give you the following extract.
"Wandsworth 28th. 12mo. I am returned home having been
"at Winchmore hill to deposit the remains of our dear
"Sister Abigail. the body kept very well - & it was not closed
"till last night. We were gratified by having it many
"days to look at - & it was a consoling sight - such an Heavenly
"calm was apparent in the countenance - so like herself
"when she was engaged in the solemn act of supplication
"in the gallery - the last meeting she attended was their select
"Mo Meeting in the sixth month. when friends met in her
"apartment & I understand she gave excellent counsel
"& expressed her belief that she was done with the work
Anner Mills 4th of 1st mo. 1822
I had no intention when taking up the pen - of perplexing thee in this way
 with my [unclear]imptinces[/unclear] - but as [unclear][/unclear] as words arrived they have in freedom
flowed to thee - I thought I felt more than an ordinary solicitude
about this young couple - that they may be concerned to
repair the waste places - and as with a weapon in one hand
to keep the grand Enemy at bay - [deletion]build[/deletion] repair the breaches with the other
that our Zion may enjoy in sabbaths again - we frequently
see that the faithfulness of an individual draws down
blessings. it seems something like a little leaven that leavens the
whole lump - & contrariwise - there is much want of vital
religion in our society of the spirit - we are too superficial.
I am obliged to my dear Lydia for the pretty poem - Sarah & Jane
their dear love to you all but particularly to their most intimate
acquaintance Elizabeth - who would gratify Jane very much
by sparing half an hour to write her a letter. we had a long epistle
from our precious D. Stephenson. who [deletion]whether[/deletion] who has again witnessed
a death bed scene, a lovely young woman of the name of "Beebee." she, her
sister & three brothers. left England on account of the delicate health of
of one sister who soon fell a victim to consumption. & one after another
now only two young lads are left - they are deeply afflicted
we may hope that dear Deborah has a work to do or has had it to do
in this remote place. she & her sister enjoy usual health they
had a most awful thunderstorm. the lightning came down a chimney

"I was craving for a confirming comforting meeting this day.
"it was not large - but solemn. many testimonies were borne
"to the worth of the deceased. & the belief of her blessed change
"that her spirit is safely centered in everlasting peace
"William Byrd broke silence Edward Carroll followed
him - then Rebecca Christy. Rebecca Byrd was sweetly
"to different ranks aged - ministers & youth - truly instructive
"Mary Allen supplicated [unclear]patiently[/unclear] - then Joseph
"Allen was heard in powerful testimony clothed as
"Samuel Neale used to be - [unclear]Alma[/unclear] Carroll concluded the
"meeting in solemn supplication - prior to which Anne
"Brewster expressed a few words - we stood a very short
"time at the grave - it was a hurricane of wind - with
"heavy rain - few comparatively came out of the meeting
"house - - - - I have sustained a great
"loss - & wish I may preserved from sinking - if it was
"not for the friend that sticketh closer than a brother
"where should I be" - - I have endeavoured amidst
many interruptions to scribble thee what I believe
will interest - my sight is so dim that I cannot
see by candle light. the dear remains worn almost
to a skeleton were un interred from 5th day night to the
6th day week following. My Aunt Hannah was to spend
last week with my Uncle John at Spencer Street & regulate
matters - so as to give up her pretty home - tho' she
was only a yearly tenant she spared no expense in having
it complete - My dear Mother seems to feel this dispensation
more obviously than when first communicated to
us. a very sweet farewell letter was penned about the
27th of 12th month. & no exertion to accomplish it seemed to
near them [deletion]him[/deletion] & tore up the bricks in the kitchen - no life [unclear]act[/unclear]
James is pretending to read by me. his subject is "Mother has not any father at
all" - Providence made all children."
I hope thy health improves. get rid of the Post office & allow
thy self more rest. I am better than sometime but not as stout
as the exemption from pregnancy might lead one to expect - Edward
promises to be a nice pet - I often smile & tell his sisters they are
to make much of him - I trust to thy generous heart - when
offering thee such a miserable return for thy most acceptable
epistle - but really thou would'st pity me when I endeavour
to write so many claims on my attention - Joseph
desires her dear love to S. White - we wished for more of her
company perhaps thou would'st pay thy sister Grubb a visit
before the wedding leaving the young folk to bustle at home
how rejoiced we should be to see thee - & have some opportunity
of returning in part the kindness which I so bountifully partook of
when with you - my best love flows to all my friends - thy sisters in
particular - thy husband & children each
I am very sincerely
thy attached E. C.

gradually died away. most peacefully in that letter she
alludes to the decease of her dear friends Sarah Darby
Elizabeth Mercer & Anne Capper --- I have had a sweet [insertion]letter[/insertion]
from Rachel Fowler in which she says "I feel interested
"about Ireland. & have thought with affectionate anxiety about
"my friends in that land. since hearing of the dreadful outrages
"committed recently in your County - the signs of the times

humbly trust that if our Society keep to their Principles preservation

or keep in view the language of our Holy Redeemer

I sent thee this extract in my last. but my memory
& all else of mine is miserably deficient. I may
well exclaim "my manifold infirmities. hearing that
your neighbour Fiztsimmons is in town. I have hastened
to finish this poor letter now so many days in hand
before I set about the business of the day. our precious
aunt M. G is about leaving us. is very poorly. was at
first meeting on first day & excellently engaged on the subject
of Jacob wrestling for the blessing in the night season
& surely this is a night season. but little of the cheering
rays of the sun either spiritually or temporally
I have just taken leave of my Aunt. She seems much worn
we wanted her to return to night. her son Robert has had a
swelled jaw. Dr Burgess attending him. they are a delicate pair

It is time for me to notice thy intimation of disposing of thy
child to be the property of another. really sometimes I [deletion]th[/deletion] have
[underline]felt[/underline] as if participating in thy feelings for tho' the prospect
may be ever so pleasing - & promising the trial must be
keenly felt by parents possessed of sensibility - I hope that you
will have comfort in the Union. that the [underline]espoused[/underline] pair may
endeavour to look for that guidance which cannot lead
astray - & which always points to simplicity & true humility

Tho' all men forsake it.. my own backslidings discourage
me from even attempting [insertion]to[/insertion] invite others to faithfulness. because
I am convinced that example goes before precept & that
nothing preaches louder.. when lately reading letters to my children
received in my juvenile [insertion]days[/insertion] they have I hoped tended to humble
me at least they should have that effect - when the dew of youth
lay on the branches. how fruits should in this have appeared

good seed. & it has become unfruitful
so that there is neither dew nor fields
