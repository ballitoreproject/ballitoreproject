I thought I felt by Sarah's silence, &
manner, that she consented there [unclear]fore[/unclear]
we went, S:T George Sanders & self
to visit a friend; here I supposed
I saw what the folk were at, they
think I hold back, or when I do
not entirely, that I am not satisfied
to be enough of a fool, ie, that
I do not preach away thro' thick & thin
I knew they wished me to be good, &
I petitioned to be [underline]made good[/underline], & felt indeed
low, when that occur'd to my mind
not to ask [underline]any thing[/underline], even to be a good
preacher, in words, for man was not to
live by [underline]this[/underline] alone, but by every (inward)
word spoken by Him, who speaks not as
man speaks. In the next sitting I felt
quiet, & thought perhaps it would never
more be required of me to speak in the
manner I have believed [deletion]required of me[/deletion] [insertion]was [/insertion] at
times. Here I also believed, that it [underline]was[/underline]
possible, to rightly visit the suffering seed,
(or when in a state of prosperity,) & pray
for.
