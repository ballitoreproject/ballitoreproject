1st Thursday- Went this morning
with Philip, TH and Deborah to a
photographer's to get Phil's taken. _
When there I was persuaded to sit
myself also, so we were both taken
together for 8/6 and were kept so
long waiting that we [insertion]were[/insertion] late for
meeting. How[insertion]ever[/insertion] as the likenesses
were pretty good, we were in some
degree compensated - They are
for Willie and I hope will reach
him safely. The two Strangmans
and their niece Miss Hancock -
James and Maria White dined
with us to day - and after
meeting returned to tea -
TH Jas and Maria went to hear
[unclear]Dousden[/unclear], and Sally Barrington
who came up in Elizabeth's place
went to an alliance meeting at the
Rotundo. Polly and I staid
at home and enjoyed one another
Oh it is delightful to have her here!
Margt came in this morning and
seems better.
May -
