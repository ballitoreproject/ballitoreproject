Dining at Trafalgar Terrace -- -.
2nd.. Papa went to town this morning - and
I took a ride after dinner.
3rd I had great going about to. day,
first into town by the nine O'clock
train with Charlie, walked to Britain
St where I only staid a short time.
Then called on Elizabeth [insertion]who was out[/insertion] and Aunt
Cole who was in and chatting to Martha
Wright. I came out to Trafalgar
Terrace by the one O'clock train, found
Avy there before me. Grandmamma
was there also - and Uncle Arthur
came to tea very soon after which Avy
and I had to be running away, as we
had to come home by the train leaving
Dalkey at 8 O'clock - so here we are
back again - Charlie has just come
out, and is looking at the Illustrated
News - Phil learning a French verb
Papa and Mama reading, Avy talking
and I scribbling
