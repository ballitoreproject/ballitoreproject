My dear Elizabeth,
I hope thou art well. I am very
much obliged to thee for the book
thou sent me, I think it is a very
pretty one. Case, the butcher, was
suspected of stealing a bullock, and
was sent, the 4th of this month, to Athy
jail. I am translating Madame
Bonne.
I am thy affetionate friend
Sarah Wright

Elizabeth Leadbeater.
