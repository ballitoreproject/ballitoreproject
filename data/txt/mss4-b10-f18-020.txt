Anchorage in the Kyles
of Bute July 22d 56
My dear Mamma
As we expect
either to sail or go by
Steamer to Gourock to-morrow
to look for our letters, I
want to have a line ready
to send to the post office,
to tell you that we are
all quite safe & well, if
the wind dont answer
for us to sail to Gourock

we intend to keep the yacht
here for to-morrow & send
for our letters, in which
I hope we may hear good
news of you all - we
met Mr Gowan at
Campbelton, and were
together till to day, when
[underline]he[/underline] took one Course, &
we took another, as
it was so Calm, Manliff
wished to anchor for the
night, so I dont know
whether we may meet
again or not - we did
not wish to be out all
night If we could help
it, but I believe [underline]he[/underline] dont
much care - the part of
the Kyles we are in now,
is not a part travellers
go to [underline]in general[/underline] & we were not quite
so far before, it is one
of the most beautiful
places I was ever in, please

get some one [insertion]to write[/insertion] [underline]immediately[/underline]
on receipt of this, to [deletion]Lamblash[/deletion]
Lamlash, [insertion]Post Office[/insertion] Island of Arran
Scotland - and in about a
day later to Stranraer Post Office
Wightonshire Scotland, as
it is likely we will call
in those Places on our
way back, & for fear we
might go back by Larne [insertion]Ireland[/insertion]
please get just a line
written there also - dear
love to all, your much
attached MJB
Please let me know do you know
how my sisters & their families are -
