1832?
My dear Eliza
Wilt thou give the
accompanying packet to FW
thyself the first time thou
can do so conveniently, I
have my reasons for not
giving it to Arthur to deliver
thou might write and
tell me whether thou feels
any easier on his account
if thou has a mind if not
I do not wish thee to do so.
So thou art going to law. perhaps
Mrs Henry Senr will think
by thy employing TH that thou
art beginning to like the [underline]Attorney[/underline]-

as well as the [underline]Doctor[/underline], take
care she dont call thee to account
when she gets thee
to Dalkey. This is a dismal
evening I suppose you are
all snug and merry at [unclear]Lambfield[/unclear],
if my Mother had
permitted I would have gone
with Manliff in the gig
but she was afraid of the
dark night, perhaps it is as
well we did not go. I have
 made two [unclear]frights[/unclear] of [unclear]handskreens[/unclear],
of the cotton. I got
a wild violet in blow in the
Glen to day, we are almost
blown away with such high
winds, now these three days
it has been blowing a hurricane.
didst thou get the
flowers and note I sent thee
this night week, thou did
not mention having got
them in any of my Mothers
notes. give my dear love
to F & L. I suppose the former
is still delighted with the
smiles of his precious little
daughter. My dear Eliza
I have not forgiven myself
for my conduct towards
thee yet nor I am afraid
ever can, with dear love
I am thy affct. sister
Selina
