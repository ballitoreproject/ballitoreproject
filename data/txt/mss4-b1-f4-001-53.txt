Farewell again, my dear child. I am glad and thankful that
I have it in my power to write myself
Thy affectionate father
R.S.
R.S. to his Daughter G.
Ballitore 9th of Seventhmonth 1787
*** I am pleased that - has at last got into our
right-honourable row. I wish him and his wife the best comfort
in domestic life. Thou canst tell them, my dear Margaret, from
thy own experience, that, though the conjugal state abounds in
many endearing gratifications, it has its own perplexities and disquietudes
- that there is but one sovereign, unmixed good, which is essentially
necessary to sanctify the union, to sweeten the attendant cares, and cause
real and substantial happiness. I wish our dear friend - may get strength
from her elementary dip, and that her spirit may be often helped to get
into the sacred pool, when the angel of the Divine Presence shall
have moved upon the waters. ***
