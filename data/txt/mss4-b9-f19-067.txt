My dear Elizth
I recd thy letter & got the
2 additional yds of bombazine
for my mother I also got a [unclear]bargain[/unclear]
of some, part of which I send to
thee which I hope thou wilt
wear for my sake I was sorry
to hear thou had been unwell
but hope thou art well before
this I heard of the young Lydia,
I hope both mother & child are
doing well - I have not seen
Eliza Chandlee yet as I was
confined to the house

with a complaint in my bowels
but hope to go & look for her
soon, Tell my mother that I
will [underline]I intend[/underline] deliver C Beall my
letter myself, & ask for the answer
the thoughts on Education are not
come yet - I fear C B did
not write for them perhaps
it would be well for my mother
to write to J H [unclear]Leery[/unclear], & ask
the reason of the delay & also
tell him to advertise [unclear][/unclear]
Connor has call'd
in gt haste adieu
