Foston 4th month 10th 82

It has been very contrary to my inclination thus long to have only returned silence for thy last favor by Robert Grubb  I felt myself hurt at the idea of incurring from one I esteem like R.S. the mark of disapprobation  In my last I did not address thee in a language comfortable (nor I think peculiar) to myself but what could I do? my former genuine feelings which I transmitted to thee appeared to bring me under thy censure & therefore to do the like ^again^ seemed not only treating thee with disrespect but rendering a seal to what I had already got quite necessary  If I know my own heart it was not reproof that could nor I hope can hurt me from the tenderness of [word crossed out] ^those^ whose eyes are open to see their Friends in the truth & to value them in proportion to their intrinsic worth discreetly strengthining [sic] the good that is in them and cautiously sapping the foundation of every ^partition^ wall between them & the bulwark of true humility & preserving fear; this was & is indeed ^the light^ in which I view my honoured Friend but thou ^must^ perceive that I was at a loss how to account for thy close observations without attributing them to what thou hadst seen thyself  as to other peoples remarks concerning me I wish I been less deserving of them & therefore shall not call in question their propriety but had I known that it was only from these that thy sentiments arose I believe I should have took kind the mark of thy regard & continued my former freedom with thee  the affection & respect which I feel to my valued Friend will not allow ^me^ to enlarge on a subject so trifling in its nature & I believe so incompatible with that sober [?] & better commerce we wish to support with the branches of the same family the Children of the one Father even edification & comfort nor will I degrade thee & myself so much as to return any part of ^thy^ letter or a context upon it for surely thy last explains the whole therefore if thou wilt excuse ^me^ (which with sincerity I beg) Ill quit the subject & acknowledge the copy of thy letter to E.H. its pertinent indeed by what I have heard of the woman & generally instructive especially to that class which I cannot but think are from their stations the most tried part of the Church militant  so various & so complicated are the assaults of the Enemy & so gilded are his baits that if those who are engaged in pulling down his Kingdom are not often brought low & themselves reduced till they resemble the master when he was without both form & comliness [sic] they are in danger of becoming ^so^ tinctured with the ^specious^ corruptions of human nature that instead of promulgating the purity of the gospel & discovering the safety of the Shepherds voice by their 
own example in attending to it & thereby adorning it, as well as ministering from it, they are secretly couching under the divine commission an attraction to self  In the consideration of some of these things & how the minds of many have lost their fidelity to the first powerful & merciful visitations of truth & have sought honour one of another till their hands have proved defiled by taking of bribes so that they could not ascend the holy mountain nor sound an alarm from ^thence^ but have sought for themselves exaltations of their own which being out of divine order & limitations they can stay ^there^ their own time without descending to visit the suffering seed for on these mountains has not the beauty of our Israel fallen & the shield of the mighty been vilely cast away as though it had not been anointed with oil I say in the consideration of these things & of my own ^weakness^ I have often been ready to faint & conclude that I should one day fall but dear Freind [sic] when we sensibly experience that divine regard is still the same & that not a sparrow falls to the ground without his notice tis then we see the means of preservation & humbly depend upon them  If I know myself I ask nor desire great things not to be made a vessel of honour in the eyes of men but in humble submission to devote myself to the manifestations of truth, to cast my crowns before it & thereby be found worthy securely to dwell with the master whether in suffering & oppression or following him in that triumph wherein he rode upon an ass all which is humiliating enough to human nature
