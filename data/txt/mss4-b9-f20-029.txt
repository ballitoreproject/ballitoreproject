My dear E - George left town the evening of the day I got
thy letter I sent the brass nobs to Mrs Fagle's & was too late I hoped
to have had the braid for the window curtains but the woman disappointed
me about it, so I bespoke it from another this evening & hope to send it
soon I think it will look very well, Edw goes at last I put in to go
along with him but it would not do, so I stay till he returns when
I intend to go & stay a week or two to breath the fresh air & see
you all - I hope thou got thy paper by G's men & H White her writing
pot are they all well at the school? I hope among you
you will get the new houses finish'd - Nezer has two teeth
& two more ready to appear on thy SB
