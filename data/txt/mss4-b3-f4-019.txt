Holdgate near York 3d month 7th 1787

My dear Uncle Shackleton

	I have been so long upbraided in my own mind with the consciousness of my debt for thy last truly acceptable letter received at Easter but summer (when I was out in the western parts of this land with my beloved & truly honoured friend, R. Jones) that I felt like one ashamed to acknowledge myself existing & ^wished^ rather ^to^ continue my obscurity than begin to spin apologies out of the poor shallow reasons for silence that i am furnished with for a considerable part of the time, & yet qualifications for profitable intercourse thou knowst are not at our command & such as are not so, would neither be acceptable to thee nor me  no doubt but if we had more faith in the little openings to right communion both with the great Head of the church & the members either collectively or individually our intimacy would oftener be sensibly renewed & strengthened for duration, & circumscribed words in the life of pure fellowship fasten it with nails that it might not be moved, thus by visible signs proving that deep still can utter unto deep  but what can we do when every ability of communication is veiled & the poor mind left to meditate only upon its own weakness & to conceive itself alone in its own peculiar 
exercises? by this query I mean to make the very best apology I have, for not writing before now that our mutually beloved S. Dillwyn has laid this sheet before me & bid me write  we were talking pleasantly about you  she shewed me a letter from thee & cousin Abraham  The renewed remembrance of you & every of your near relatives was cheering, as you feel to many of use here if we are worthy to be so classed as near kindred, so much so in the best sense, that I can hardly believe we are no otherwise related by outward ties than that brother Samuel married thy daughter; that however is an union of no small importance to me  my dear sister Margarets friendship is precious to me & promises me some cordial drops if as we apprehend our residence should in a little time be fixed at Clonmel  you would hear at Ballitore of my dear RGs sudden departure from Ireland & the occasion of it  I was took very ill at Sheffield at the close of a family visit there with an inflammation in my lungs  it appeared to be coming on for several weeks as I had never been well since a few days attendance ^12th month last^ upon J. Dickinson of Beverley in the awful closing scene of his life, with which my mind was more than usually affected & involved in the gloomy passages of death, though my hopes seemed to amount to beleif [sic] that ^by^ his removal he knew an end of sorrow & all tears to be wiped away which was not the case with me, for bodily complaints gradually encreased upon me till I was brought to nearly the same state  [paper torn] degree of illness in which I saw him, & in wisdom no doubt it was allotted that the secret conflicts of my mind were not less greivous [sic], so that my recovery appears to myself as well as others that saw ^me^ very marvellous, being an evident display of the omnipotence couched in the gracious declaration I am the Lord that healeth thee  My dear husband was favoured to get safe & speedily to me which was an unspeakable comfort to us both especially as I was favoured to recover pretty quick & he did not appear to be injured in his health by his expeditious journey  he talks something now of staying till after yearly meeting before returning to his work & then I hope it may be right for us to go together & have often wished to write to thee & Aunt Shackleton upon the subject of forming a plan as there are none I could with more confidence [paper torn] freedom have been
[note margin p. 1]
open with, but my spirits often got low about ^it^ & that little faith I thought I had received I found very hard to keep & secretly to [paper torn] kept me silent to many  I have wrote to AS & M 

B[illegible]
I am reminded that writing is bad for me therefore with the solicitude [paper torn]

[page 2]
Thy letter of 1st month last gave me pleasure in a two fold sense, because you were well & still retained an affectionate rememberance [sic] of one, who dearly loves you, altho she is conscience of not being worthy your kind notice in the Epistle way, especially if judging by the number she has sent you. I can truly say however, that my dear friends at Ballitore, have not been at any time long from my mind since I left you  but Love, I need not tell you is mostly better felt than expressed (even by the notables of Ballitore) had it not been so to me, you would doubtless have heard much oftener from me, dear Molly in particular to whom I am under so many obligations  but should we be favoured to meet in London, I may acknowledge it so as to obtain a Discharge in full, & then open a new account. I have seldom been free from a cough since leaving Ireland, owing to taking colds from the dampness of this climate, the latter part of the winter has been unusually mild and having had several little excursions into the country with dear good Esther Tuke & my GD, am now finely recruited  it was a great comfort to be with them they have lately visited most of the Families of the Meetings belonging to this & Malton monthly meeting  which has afforded the young folks (Betsy Tuke, A. Tu ^E. Abram^ & Margaret English) in their Line opportunities of exercising their gifts, they were mostly of the 
party and are all hopeful. Indeed the dear old Lady has great cause to be thankful for the harvest her pious labours have been blessed with; & may be truly said to be the spiritual master of many children, & if they turn out as dedicated to the cause they are inlisted in as she is, this part of the vineyard will certainly flourish.  In return for thy pleasing Intelligence of thy dear daughter Lydias present to you of another Pet, I may tell thee our Brother William Dillwyns wife brought him a George the 2nd the 1st of last month  Sister S.D. has been poorly & feverish for many months past & has not much expectation of nursing it herself, but I beleive [sic] is not yet provided with a wet nurse; They inform me he is a lovely harty boy, & I begin already to feel interested in his welfare, tho Ive not seen him  I had not heard of the removal, by death, of innocent Debby Haughton till thou informed me  I well remember her & also worthy Dorothy Watson, whom the well wrote lines Molly sent me were [illegible]  I wrote thy dear wife in haste, & supposing the D. Watson she mentioned might be Tommys mother, occasioned that query  Young Isaac Jackson was not at home when thy wife took me to their house  The good old man required, & not [sic] doubt has, the sympathy of his friends  My GD understanding I intended writing you, desired me to tell you that he had been thinking with such near affection of his friends at Ballitore, & others in Ireland, as to enquire the time of your next half years meeting, thinking it possible the gale might rise high enough to waft him over to Dublin; but the prospect has since opened, of once more attending that of Scotland, to be held at Edinburgh the 1st 4th day in the 5th month. no company has yet occured [sic], tho I hope some will; as the Ride is long, & it will be close work for him, should he think it right to try for the yearly meeting of London also  John Pemberton still remains in Cumberland, & by his communications appears to be very low  it may be either to wean him from, or prepare him for, another Turn into that country. William Mathews we understand is now in London, hoping for permission to embark soon  L. Dicks & R. Wright are visiting families in Devonshire house meeting P. Brayton & & Mable Jinkins [sic] were about Bedfordshire  Ann Jessop in Cheshire  R Jones [word crossed out] with C. Hustler (& I believe E. Hoyland) have just finished visiting families in Balby monthly meeting & now think of going Southward  As thou wilt probably meet with many of our friends in Dublin, I desire thou will particularly ^remember^ us to dear Joseph Williamss whole self  to dear Joseph Pike & his wife  our kind friend Ann Elly, to whom my mind has many times been affectionately drawn  but she must not think me ungrateful in not writing to her  indeed she must not  nor our much loved Betsy Pim, who I desire thou will give my Dear love to  I have carefully reserved 2 or 3 curious beans from America, for ^thy^ dear wife, when I can get R.G. to take them  she is very good to be so thoughtful about me  This was ^at first^ intended to be considered as a general Epistle to thy whole self, including thy Son & Daughters, but shall attempt to stain the other side, & if I was able to give it ten times its value, I should not begrudge one bit of it to you  As it is, accept it as a little Token of sincerest affection from your much obliged friend S G Dillwyn

Dost thou correspond with the Cumberland Pack [?] ?  I must acknowledge I am his debtor for several very valuable little pieces & yet have not the resolution to tell him I think my self [paper torn
S Grubb desired me to apologize for her incorrect writing  but I think it requires none  She is exceeding [line torn at bottom]

I may say with my kind friend A.S. that his being so near York without our haveing [sic] the satisfaction of seeing each other, was far from pleasant, his acceptable letter however afforded some comfort under the disappointment, it was accompanied by the worsted  I remember the Provincial school thou mentions, was on foot when I was with you, & am pleased it is revived  My GD has been lately trying to prevail on friends in Norfolk Suffolk & Essex to resume the consideration of a school, they were about establishing for those 3 counties, & indeed if an Improvement of our religious society is aimed at, this seems to be like beginning at the right end  One of my sisters in America (whom I often mentioned to your dear Molly) wrote me she had for some time, an earnest desire to open a school for the poor children in her neighbourhood, in order to give them a little useful learning, that place being badly off for schoo^l^mistresses  On new years day 8[paper torn] she accordingly opened a school for girls only in their own house, with the halfconsent of an indulgent husband, provided a writing master for half days, & in nine months that it was kept up, had 40 scholars, many of the poor little girls walking 6 miles every day. Some she boarded & others she permitted to sleep in the house  She was so delighted with the Task that it was with reluctance she broke up her school on account of their removal into Philadelphia  her husband being [paper torn] ^to^ the ague & fever, he thought a city life [paper torn] suit him better  her concern still continues & I believe he will consent to her being a superintendent  thinking the whole care might endanger her health. The employment she says was so pleasing that she believes she could have managed near double the number with ease they being so attentive & diligent she never had cause to chide them, but for not being willing to leave off work  it surprised me to hear of the large quantity of plain work done, beside samplers &c. in the 9 months  I have been twice at Ackworth & have a nice sampler of the girls to take home as a pattern, which I prize much
We are really glad to hear thy amiable Lydia, & her precious little name sake are in a thriving way, our best wishes attend them, & the rest of your dear little ones  Does George continue to bid fair for being as clever a fellow as at first?  There is so striking a resemblance of your son Richard, in sweet Elen Abrams face, that I am often put in mind of him  A letter from our deeply tried [paper torn] John [paper folded, rest of line illegible] He, Barbara [paper torn] Jane Pearson had had several meetings from among friends, the last at St B[paper torn] noted for the Education of youth, It was held in their large school house & attended by a [paper torn] number of people & the scholars, many of whom educated for the gown. The chief Master was very respectful  drank tea with them, & parted with tears in his eyes, solidly wishing success to their Endeavours  J.P. had then some expectation of going to London to try whether the company of his friends there will release him from the concern he has been so long cloathed with  I expect my GD will set off the day after tomorrow for Masham & pass thro the dales to the Cumberland Quarterly meeting in his way to Scotland  He desires to be remembered in 
tender affection to dear afflicted Anna Taverner also joins me ^in^ love to the Aughtons & all our kind Ballitore ^acquaintance^ not forgetting dear Molly Miller if [paper torn] you  I remain, dear Abram & Lydia, your sincerly [sic] affectionate & obliged friend S G Dillwyn

Altho my dear Molly & Sally are the last addressed on this sheet, they are not the least beloved  My residence has been for near 11 months with my country folks Lindly & Hannah Murray; in that time Ive seen a good deal of the country & many kind friends  & when a remarkable fine prospect has presented, I have particularly wished for my Molly to be along side of me  I often smile at our grand schemes (which as yet have proved only imaginary) of viewing the Royal pair  however what we had so set our hearts upon, may come to pass yet  The other day I heard, that a Parson at Doncaster is actually constructing a thousand Looms to work by steem [sic] which will weave forty yards each of fine cotton a day, without any attendance than that of a little boy  but I dare say you will join with me in giving the preformance [sic] to another steem [sic] scheming whym. You must know that two north britons have invented a carriage to be also moved by steam without Horses, & instead of calling at Inns for oats & hay, it will only stop once in a while for a pan of fresh coals  O that such a carriage, at our command, had stoped [sic] at the Retreat when Sally, & her friend Beckey were going to Clonmell [sic], I might have steped [sic] into it without reluctance  & had the satisfaction of going to see dear worthy Samuel Neale & wife  indeed I like this plan better than that of the male [sic] coaches as it is better for the drivers to spend their fire in harmless fume upon the carriage than in slashing the backs of the poor horses  Is dear Nancy Sparks still in your country? do remember [paper torn] to her, also to her sister Mary & Jane Watson  I suppose the sprightly little Eliza has forgot us  shes a sweet child  I frequently think pleasantly of a number of you

[page 4]
should you write to our beloved E Pim do tell her that Margaret Saunderton (late Shellets [?]) has an excellent good husband & has lately presented him with a fine child both like to do well!  & that Thomas Broadbank has lately buried his innocent wife, she was long declining  they lived at Tottenham
we are just going to send to the Post office so must bid you adieu  I shall always be glad to haer from you  do give my kind love to M Hudson & good old nanny  from yours affectionately SGD
3 month 8th 1787 My GD just coming in desires to be joined to all the persons I have mentioned
by a letter our Host has now received from New York we are informed that Thomas Colly & John Storer are likely to return home this spring
