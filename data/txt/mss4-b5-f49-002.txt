I hope thou dost not think
that thy letter was un
I assure thee it gratified me
[unclear][/unclear] much to hear from thee, and I should
be very sorry to drop my correspondence with
thee. I suppose you were surprised
to hear of my brother Thomas's removal to England
indeed it was a great surprise to us, and
although we regretted that he should be so
far separated from us and without a prospect
of soon meeting again yet on his own account
we rejoiced at it as it may be the means
of placing him in a permanent establishment
of his own. He is very much pleased
with the idea of having Theodore with

Thomas since he got to

already of the school.
James White has been [unclear][/unclear]
by [deletion]Thomas[/deletion] [insertion]his [/insertion]leaving him, but
is too generous to regret [insertion]it[/insertion] [/deletion]his leaving him
I heard of [unclear][/unclear] thy husband being in Clonmel
several times lately, tell him I think he
might give us a call when he is so near
I would be very glad to see him in Limerick.
Jacob Harvey has not yet returned nor are
[deletion] he [/deletion] we likely to see him here for some weeks longer
I think if he business all own of it, it is [deletion]likely[/deletion]
probable [/unclear] he may be at the Carlow Meeting -
It is very provoking that he is not spending
the winter at home, we shall have very little

[unclear][/unclear] all. My brother has
[unclear][/unclear] in London nor is he
[unclear][/unclear] him. I desired
[unclear][/unclear] to lend us the Ann [unclear][/unclear]
[unclear][/unclear] from the worth as
[unclear][/unclear] be obliged to thee to
[unclear][/unclear] the first opportunity as I
[unclear]think [/unclear]thy would amuse my father and
grandmother who are longing to see thee
It gives me pleasure to inform thee
that my father's health is gradually mending,
he has been out several times I should
enter into more particulars detail but want of time
which I expect will be apology also for
this careless scrawl. With my dear love
to all my Ballitore friends I remain thy
ever affectionate
