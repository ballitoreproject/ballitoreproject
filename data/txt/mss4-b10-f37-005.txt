My dear Lucy
I send the two little
frocks and three pairs of trousers
made out of some thing which
my Mother gave me, they are
a good deal thicker material
than the shirting, and better
adapted for cold weather, I
have not made the others yet
as it is not likely he could wear
them at the same time on
account of the difference in the
warmth of the two. The frocks
were done before I got the pattern
I hope they may fit

there is one a little longer
than the other which might
be left by. I did not put the
mother of Pearl Buttons as thou
wilt see. I have no news
for thee not having been out of
this since I saw thee [insertion]except[/insertion] [deletion][/deletion] at
meeting. Edward was here for
two nights last week and
was as pleasant as he could
be, it was dreadful weather
we fared tolerably well through
it all I am sorry to hear
you have been so much
injured. every day with us
from seventh day till the
sixth day following was
wet and storms enough
to blow the house down we
had terrible floods in the
river. I send the patterns
I left it wide enough for
thee every where particularly
under the arms including
turning in so that thou need
not allow any for that. I
must stop as the messenger
is just going. so with dear love
to thy self & Frank believe me
thy affectionate sister
Selina
Seventh day
the trousers are not new except one pair
I need scarcely tell thee to [unclear]took[/unclear] how it is [unclear]pate[/unclear]
I send the pattern which I like best
if it is not all gone send me nine
yards or eight & a half if more convenient,
though I would rather have
the nine
