to cheerful and pretty down
in the valley; if I had been
a poetess I might have dashed
off some little tribute to
the memory of the scene,
but alas! on the contrary
I am a very prosy little
piece of goods. I wrote
to C Pim this morning
as I did not see her yesterday.
went to town in the carriage
as they are going if nothing
unforseen presents, down
to Belfast tomorrow, as
the British Association meets
there this year & Papa
wishes to attend it I believe.
So here we are alone again,
poor Margt will I fear be
still more lonely in town
by herself. After dinner
Papa & Mama
