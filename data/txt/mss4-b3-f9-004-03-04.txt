From the same to the same

Ballitore: 19/2 month 1772.

My dear Cousin,

	++++ I salutewith my affectionate respects, & wish him, through Divine favour, the restoration of his health, & that best of comforts which only can effectually support the mind in the wadings & despondencies which it has at times to pass through while in these earthly tenements, in order for its [sic] being weaned from an attachment to visible objects, & refined & purified, & prepared for admittance into ^a^ place of rest when these poor perishing vehicles of clay shall cease to live.
	I note, my dear friend, thy plaintive language as to thy own situation of soul, & I mark with peculiar satisfactions the openness with which thou unbosoms [sic] thyself to me; because I dearly love thee & thy dear Spouse, & I am glad that the Friendship amongst us, planted I trust by a good hand, & a right-seed, does not seem to suffer decay, but to witness a revival from season to season. If the great Apostle witnessed bonds & afflictions to betide him every where [sic], well may we expect to be at times bound in spirit, & not to feel that enlargedness which we at other times may experience. It is a day of general famine in our land, & I believe the very best suffer want. What have we then to do, but to possess our souls in patience, watching unto prayer & a capacity to breathe in secret that Almighty help may be near us, & preserve us alive in the root of our affections to him, & fidelity to his cause, though little fruit may appear [page number] 162 on our branches? Ye have at home your family of innocent children. I doubt not but ye sit down at times in an evening with them, feeling after the blessing which makes truly rich, & at times select such portions of holy Writ, or such historical account of the labours & sufferings of our ancient friends, as is suited to the capacities of Children. In this exercise, your minds being gathered to the gift of God in yourselves, I trust ye find a degree of Peace & satisfactions. And if we stand devoted & resigned in all our faculties to do the will of our Creator made known to us by the revelation of his Spirit, we shall surely be accepted of him, though we may appear contemptible in our own eyes, & even in the eyes of others. You will have had I supposed before this reaches a visit from our dear friend William Hunt & his Company, I make no doubt but he was instrumental to revive a degree of precious faith among the drooping spirits of some among you. When the transient servant is gone, may the permanent Master (the beloved Son) be diligently listened to, heard & obeyed in all things! Then shall we be disciples indeed, growing from stature to stature in religious experience, till we arrive at the stability of pillars in the house which will go no more out. +++
	I am, my dear friend, thine sincerely.
