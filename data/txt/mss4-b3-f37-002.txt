Dear Cousin 
Richard Shackleton/


        I received thy Letter and one from Cousin Mary to my Dear Mother, but she departed this Life the 28th of 5 month and thy letter was dated the 25 of the same month, My Mother was poorly some months [sic] before, ^and^ she was senseble [sic] of her latter end, though she stired [sic] about till 4 or 5 Days [sic] before she dyed [sic], and would have my Dear Father to sleep with her that Night ^as he had always before^ and a bout [sic] 6 oClock in the Morning she departed, and I hope his [sic] gone to aplace [sic] of rest prepared for the righteous, it is agreat [sic] trial to my Father to part with so kind and affectionate a wife at his time of Life and myself with so good a Mother, but as bad as you think of me I will promise this to make my Father [sic] life as comfortable as I can while in this World, with the assistance of kind Providence, I have removed my bed into my Fathers Chamber for it is not safe for him to be left by himself he as [sic] had some fits in the Night time since my Mothers death but is pritty [sic] well in health at present, which I have a great deal to be thankfull [sic] for, and I hope I shall endeavour to make our lives agreable [sic]  we have had great changes in Selby Meeting since I wrote last by death & other things, but as I wrote twice to Cousin Mary and received no answer, if it had not been I thought it my duty to write now I should never a rote [sic] ^a third letter^ till I had heard from some of you, which I can truly say we always was pleased to hear from any of your Family My Father joines [sic] with me in kind Love to thee thy Wie and all thy familys [sic] as if named from thy Cousin
