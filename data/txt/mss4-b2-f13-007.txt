Dear Cousin								Skipton 3 month 6th 1767

R. Shackleton / Since I wrote to thee last we have had a great deal of Trouble on my Brothers Account  he was then fixd at Idle near Bradford & we heard a pretty good Account of him, but he being sent for to Skipton concerning settling his Affairs he came to our House, but going to see his Wife & Children she woud not give him the opportunity, but went to her Fathers & took the Children with her, he followd but was denied the sight of her & his Children (the youngest he had never seen) & meeting with nothing there but abuse & ill usage seemd much unsettled & perplexd in his Mind, & about 2 Weeks after his return to Idle he went from thence to Leeds & enlisted into General Brudenalls 51st Regiment of Foot ^&^ Captain Jackess Company then recruiting at Leeds  My sister being very uneasy about him desired my Husband woud procure his Discharge if there was any hopes ^that^ he repented of what he had done & she woud advance the Money  My Husband went to Leeds to see after my Brother but was advised by Friends there not to buy him off believing it woud then answer no End, my Brother himself told him that he woud not have us throw any Money away for so long as he met with such unmerciful & Savage Treatment from his Wife & her Friends he coud not engage for his not doing it again if at Liberty- Dr. Heid went with my Husband to the Captain whom they told [crossed out word] he woud find him a Man not fit for the Service & when he was weary of that way of Life if he would acquaint us perhaps we shoud procure his discharge or to that Effect &c I had a Letter from my Brother about a week ago dated from Dublin where they were just arrivd after a violent storm at sea & great Danger & I suppose by this Time they may have reachd the Regiment which lies at Galloway  My Brother was rather pressing upon us for Money both before he left England & in his last from Dublin but we apprehending that giving him any thing but just a meer Trifle woud rather hurt than be of any service to him (as he is not only guilty of drinking at times to Excess) but ^we^ believd also put upon such applications by the soldiers who finding the weakness of his Disposition may easily share it with him we gave ^him^ but little before he went nor sent him any thing since. Time & Reflection has already made things rather easier than they appeard at first hoping that the hardship he will undergo (if his Constitution can bear it) may bring him in time to a just sense of his Errors &c & when theres any likely prospect of that happy Event I hope my sister & self shall if we live to see it act the part of sisters to him, according to our Ability  My Husband has all along taken a true part with us & has on all Occasions done his best I believe for him, both in assisting & advising him & tho his Endeavours have been ineffectual yet, it made things rather easier to my sister & me: but I believe we shall always be in fear about my Brother while he continues as he is his Constitution is bad & shatterd by Ilness, Troubles, & perhaps by Intemperance too, & shoud he undergo the military correction in any degree of severity, thro inattention to what he has now made his Duty, or be in Liquor, he might not survive it, or perhaps might desert without considering the Consequences, we have all those Fears at times upon us, but I hope he is still under the notice of kind Providence & not yet left entirely to himself, & perhaps this rash step of his may in its Consequences be a means of recovering him & bringing him to think & act as he ought to do
We are all thro Mercy favoured with good Health & I shall be glad to hear how you are; when thou hast opportunity to write to me thy Favours are always very acceptable - I am dear Cousin with sincere Love to you all (as if named), thy affectionate Kinswoman Elizabeth Dale
P.S. My Husband desires to be respectfully rememberd to you all please to excuse haste &c
