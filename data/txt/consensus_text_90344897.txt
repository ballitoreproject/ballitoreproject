as it was rather late & we did
not much fancy meeting any
body in the plantation.
Mary and Anne had gone down
to meet us, but we most misteriously
we found on comparing notes,
that we had taken different
walks. Poor Mrs Thomas
Kift was not well and
confined to her room.
We spent a very pleasant
evening chatting to..gether We
both like Mrs Kift - & the
girls also. Thomas Kift was
also there. Philip came
for us rather late, as he
was delayed by missing
his way, the night was
so very dark - indeed no
wonder - returning I
think we would most
missed each other however
