My dear Cousin
Thou must have wonder'd at my silence but
I waited to tell thee that Edw has in his hands Â£18
of thine & wishes to know from thee how thou wouldst
have it sent to thee - thy letter was very welcome
to us letting us know of thy welfare but I hope thou wilt
not confine thyself too much to the office at the Foundry
it would not at all suit thy health at such an advanced age
it would do thee more good to go & gossip a little with
our friends at the Groves & to walk round the wall
which I think being so high is a very healthful walk
My aunt Sally continues on the foot which in my opinion
is the chief source of her health if I may use such
an expression, the alterations thou mentions have
taken place at Ballitore & the schoolhouse has now
no sign of a school Mary S has been busy removing
their furniture from the Mill to it but they
have not as yet taken up their abode there My
Aunt does not half like the change neither does
Richd S who laid out so much money on his
drawing room & took house making them complete in

in his own eyes, there are several nice residences
to let just now in Ballitore, the Mill otherwise "[unclear]Griere[/unclear]
Bank" the Cottage, one part of Fuller's Court & half
on the whole of the School besides some small
houses which have been lately built by Stephen Wilson
So Ballitore continues to alter - thy intelligence
of Mary's safety was very pleasant I hope the young David
will thrive & he left to comfort his parents they have
meekly bourne the loss of several precious ones & I sincerely
hope they will have the pleasure & comfort of bringing up
this young creature their sweet Mary is a credit
to them, I have added one to my number just
3 weeks ago a vigorous little girl who tho' the 11th child
was hail'd with great joy on account of her sex, I am
trying to [unclear]have[/unclear] her myself & feel still a little weakly
we have call'd her Lydia Sarah - It was very pleasant
to you all to have Sally's company I hope she continues
to like her friends as well as at first, I have not
seen Eliza this long time, & now dear Cousin I must
bid thee farewel I am growing a little tired I hope
to hear from thee very soon, Margaret desires to be most
affectionately remember'd to thee & with kind remembrance
to all your household I remain thy affecte cousin
