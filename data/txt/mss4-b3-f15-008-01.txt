Ballitore: 1/3 month 1768

Dear friend,

	+++ Tommy Carletons death has penetrated us to the quick. His father will stand much in need of the tender sympathy of his friends & of the best consolation, which I trust heartily wish may be opened to him. We have some of us known the day of distress, & our tears to be our meat. It seems as if we must still go deeper down into the river of judgment, & be washed & agitated many times therein, before the impression of holiness be stamped on the vessel, thus rightly ^thoroughly^ prepared & sanctified for use. I see, I feel we are to submit all to this power, & our reasoning & comparing about religious matters are to be absorbed of it, even as Aarons rod swallowed up the rods of the Magicians of Egypt. May we know the day of the Lords power to make us willing to be as fools for his sake, & cause that in our humiliation our own judgment being taken away, we may know a being clothes, fed and taught by that which can alone rightly qualify & support! +++++
	I am thy sincere friend
		Richard Shackleton
