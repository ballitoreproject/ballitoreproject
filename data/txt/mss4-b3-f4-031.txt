I have received my dear fathers long wished for, kind affectionate letter, for which I am greatly obliged: & our dear cousin S(R)G saying, if I began one to thee while she was here she would like to add to it hastens my reply, in this particular doing as I would wish to be done by. Dear Samuel Smith here, cousin Sally came to meet him, & I suppose they will be likely to leave this together, perhaps on second day; as I am like to lose his company at home, I think having so much of it in this other home a favour: they are going to see Joshua Beale, who is very poorly & feeble. I called in to see Hannah White last fifth day, she looked dismally, & shaking her head & her eyes brim-full said, it was almost over with her, & that she could now have no comfort in my company, as she had when I was here before: it is very affecting to see & hear her. In reply to thine respecting the leisure & tranquillity [sic] which I enjoy favourable to writing letters, it is true I have plenty of leisure, was I but capable of filling it up properly, but this I know I am not, & were I to be settled to a wish for writing often, my weakness &c: is so great that it would be almost impossible to me to frame a letter worth thy acceptance, very likely I should amongst many other forgets, forget to date itself. Samuel Smith sends thee dear love, also to my mother & Abraham: J: Haddock^win^ sends his also. James Abell was here a little while yesterday, desired me besure to send you his: I expect he will get time to go to Waterford, but really I think I have seldom seen a man busier, I hope it is a good sign: in him. I do not admire Abrams not geting [sic] that poor scrap I sent him to Moat, Jo: Hatton directed it for me, I think to Joseph Robbinsons care. I hope he ^AS^ is not angry with me. Is it in Ballitore J: Pike intends building? I never expect to be out of beloved D Ds debt. S: & S: Neale know not of my writing now; Samuel not stout I do fear he will not be fit to venture to Waterford, Sarah seems to think she was the means of getting me thy last letter: A Sparkes with A: Taverner this some time. It is pleasant to look forward to seeing thee so soon: I wish dear S:N may be able to come: I expect E: Burose [?] & I will go together some way or other. I am obliged to my very dear father for not blaming me about not writing, I hate to be scolded, it stirs up the evil spirit in me: alas! I hardly know what I like, or do not like: however, (tho unlikely to mend I fear) yet am I desirous to be screened & loved by you my honoured parents. Dearly farewell. S: Shackleton.

My dear Uncle

	Since I cant set a face of being out of humor now, having nothing to occasion it, I am willing to make a little atonement for my last; the spirit of which it seems thou found out  I was cross sure enough & could be so again with entering into the ^same^ subject: but now leaving those things that are behind let us speak of the present & press forward to such as are before, which have divine excellency in them & are therefore worthy our pursuit; for we have seen an end of much human perfection & shall continue to do so, I hope in faith that the fruition of those consolations & earnest of the spirit intermixed in the other allotments of our day, will not be witheld [sic]; but that the end of our ^faith^ will in abundant & unremitted mercy prove to be the salvation [paper torn]  It seems strange to find myself in [obscured by seal] again  it was neither a desire to shew [obscured by seal] or my opinion that I came; but a little secret & almost doubted intimation that it would be right for me to be at Bandon with our dear friend S. Smith which after some reasoning I yielded to, but expected to find his visit there over before we met, which proved otherwise: Thomas Harris (who coming thro Clonmel was my escort) & myself just reaching Cork as meeting broke up on 3d day & two hours before the time of friends setting off for Bandon which just allowed time for the needful refreshment & we all went together  Samuel rather unlike himself was disposed to let the townspeople know of the intended meeting next ^day^ & a very great number came amongst whom was most of the soldiers & their major a good looking company with whom (I thought) the truth had some place & upon the whole it was the largest & most satisfactory meeting of three which I have attended there; so that there occured [sic] new cause of thankfulness for a little of that direction which is most precious & strengthening to the mind  This dear Sally of yours is a comfort & is a sweet companion in spiritual exercise  I find she has divers times exposed herself in this great city & in so doing lifted up that sacred ensign, which the nations want attracting to  Friends in this province have great nearness to & unity with her  I congratulate thee & her truly valuable mother in your youngest child (not setting up the gates of Jericho) but caring for the holy city & devoting her faculties thereto  Farewell my truly valued & valueable [sic] uncle  my love is to my dear Aunt &c & I am thy SRGrubb
