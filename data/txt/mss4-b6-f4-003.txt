Newyork 7th Month 20th 1818
My dear Friend
Thy long & very acceptable Epistle
dated 17th of -- Mo. (I presume 3rd) reached me several
weeks ago, & I have been only been waiting for an opportunity
to Dublin, to reply to it, although I feel how
inadequately I can repay thee for the pleasure I
received, in the perusal of thy interesting detail of
domestic intelligence. To hear of the continued welfare
of my Ballitore friends is very gratifying, & to
be remembered by them, is equally flattering. I can
never look back on the many happy months-nay-years,
that I spent in your "Classic Vale," without feeling
the retrospection [deletion]as[/deletion] accompanied by a sigh, which, if
embodied into words, would say "surely, thy happiest
days are past." My experience in life has been so trifling,
having scarcely [insertion]yet[/insertion] passed my boyish days, it may
seem the height of presumption in me, to offer an opinion,
but still I cannot well avoid coming to the
conclusion, that the days of our childhood afford
us more real enjoyment, than we can presume to
look for, in more advanced age. While young, we
are in a state of happy ignorance, as to the vices,
follies & wickedness of the World, & of course, regard
Mankind, as possessing the same purity with which we

are clothed. - but, when experience teaches us the absurdity
of the picture, when we daily witness the practical
frailty of human Nature,- does not this knowledge destroy
half our enjoyment, & render us proportionally miserable? -..
but when I commenced, I did not intend a
digression of this Kind.
What thou mentions about
McAllister, shall be attended to. Whenever he wants to
send money to Ireland, Abm Bell will cheerfully pass
it thro his hands.
An intimate friend of mine
will be going to Virginia in a few weeks, & can easily
find out what thou wishes to know respecting a family
of Walpoles on James' River. He is well acquainted
about that part of the Country, & remembers the name;
& I have delayed making further inquiries, on purpose
to avail myself of this favourable opportunity. I shall
furnish him with the necessary memorandum, &, so
soon as I receive his communication, let thee know.-
Thy list of deaths was affecting, though I knew most
of the individuals but by name. - Maurice Farmer's was
particularly awful.- What dreadful consequences are
often occasioned by drunkenness!
It afforded me sincere pleasure to hear of
the prospect of conjugal happiness which once more
has opened to my old & worthy Master, James White,
I hope the [underline]continuance[/underline] of his felicity, will be proportionate
to [underline]his[/underline] worth, & [underline]that[/underline] of his amiable wife.- then,
indeed, their day has but just commenced, - the shades

of evening are afar off. - Please remember me affectionately
to both of them, & present my best wishes for
their welfare.-
I do not wonder that you felt regret
at parting with Thomas Fisher, his enjoyment seemed
so interwoven with Ballitore. - I think he will prove
a credit to his family, & reflect honour on the place of
his Education, when he reaches manhood. - I receive
[deletion]a[/deletion] letters from him frequently, & he never fails to
mention the delight he experiences from his extensive
correspondence in Ballitore.-
It is time for me to thank thee,
for the interesting piece of Poetry, with which
thou favored me - I admire it much, & feel
full unison, with the sentiments it contains.
The torture which the Brute Creation in general suffer
from their "Lords & Masters", is very grating to every
humane disposition, & cannot be sufficiently reprobated.-
If we are strong, let us also be merciful, & evince by
our actions, the superiority of Reason to instinct.-
let us not commit actions which we term [underline]"Brutish."[/underline]
I was very much astonished, the other
day, when Thomas OBrien, walked into our office -
Not having the smallest idea of his being in America,
I at first did not know him, - but he soon made
himself acquainted.- He arrived in the Ship Courier from
Liverpool, & stopped but two days in Newyork, after wch.
he departed for Philada. - intending, I believe, to go
Westward from that City.- I had but half an hour's

conversation with him, the day before he left this place.
I asked him a number of questions about all my old acquaintances,
& it really seemed as if old scenes were
renewed.
What numbers of our Countrymen, are
weekly arriving in America - young, middle aged,
& old - I do not, cannot wonder at their choice.-
If they proceed to the interior, before they become
contaminated, with the vices of the Seaport towns,
there is little or no fear, of their finding plenty of employment;
& of being enabled in a few years to become
independent Landholders themselves - proprietors
of the farms they cultivate.- how preferable is
this, to the miserable, degraded state in which a great
proportion of the Irish Peasantry, drag on their lives
at home - cringing continually to some inexorable
Landlord, who having squeezed the "uttermost farthing"
from them in prosperous times, will make no allowance
when the bounties of Nature diminish, or
the demand for their produce almost ceases! -
Yet as thou says, "were the grievances at home redressed,
what part of the world is so temperate, so healthful,
so cheerful, as our Emerald Isle?" Every Irishman
in whom the smallest spark of "Amor Patriae", has
ever glowed, will answer: "No such spot is to be
found"! Nature has indeed done every thing
for our Country, Man very little! Can any one
