        I have received my dear fathers very kind affectionate letter, for which I am grateful, as also for my kind brothers addition.dear A: Taverner went last seventh-day morning with the English friends (or rather in company, in a chaise with E: Balfore,) to Waterford, & tho she got very little sleep sixth night, yet she seemed tolerably setting off.I cannot say I thought thine & Lydias tenderness would do her real injury, but I felt my preverse [sic] heart not inclined so much so, & I knew you were going away, & dreaded not being able to keep it up: it grieved me that she was not as faithful as she ought, & made me crossish I believe:  I knew her to be so very different before leaving Limerick, that I imagined her not so poorly as perhaps she was:  so much for an apology to thee & Lydia, who (I thought) thought me remiss:  on sixth-evening Anna in the chair with T [?]: Crawley, & mercy [sic] in our cab: with me, which I drove, sister Margaret behind her Samuel, cousin Sarah behind her Robert, & cousin Hannah behind her son went to tea to Anner-mills: I slept there with Anna that night, & sister on her car with little Margaret, Samuel, & John came seventh evening for me.  Yesterday E: Pim had a letter for^om^ J: Clibborn; I wish it might come into they heart (my dear father) to send him a line. While I remember I wish to communicate to you a piece of agreeable news, which perhaps you have already heard viz: that Peggy Rogers (perhaps about 10 days since) bore a daughter, & both recover bravely, had what is terms a good time. I believe it was yesterdays post brought account that Edwards daughter Sally Hatton was very ill, & that Peggy Beale was hardly expected to recover from I think a bilious fever: E: Pim had lately a sweet letter from Samuel Neale, I believe he is but poorly in health. Mary Dudl^e^y rather better, gets down stairs but not much out.  A: Broadhead midling [sic].  Sally Alexander has been very poorly, & I believe continues so.  It does afford me satisfaction to find M: Bewley is with you, which circumstance (for a wonder) proves me not so selfish either my dear love to her.  As I walked the other day pretty quick alone up this street, where art thou going in such a hurry, says Mansergh at my shoulder, the same Went, he enquired kindly for you all.  Is it true that the stone in our grave-yard is buried? Lydias wrist & wax which she left behind, I mean to send by Abby Widdows.  I wish some there would have an eye out for a servant for Anna, I have some notion of hearing that Sally Doyle was not likely to bide at Prospect, if this be true I wonder would she answer:  I rejoice in dear cousin Abbys recovery, I fear tho the nursing will be too much for her, I hope she has not the child to sleep with her.  Betty Wilson bravely, nursing her daughter Elizabeth, John looks smug & content, & I do not hear much complaints about him, so perhaps he may come into fashion again. I believe brother Samuel intends to send pretty soon for his son Richard, I doubt not but A: Widows will take that oppertunity [sic] of going home, by whom I hope to write again, I expect sister Peggy will fill up this. I wish to hear more particularly about my mother, does she get out to ride? will she not go now for M: Bewleys sake. I do not forget my dear old Nanny.  My love to all Haughtons, Wilsons, &cs: to my aunt Fuller & Debby How is Bill Linen & nurse? This is a very unworthy answer to thine, but I believe thou wilt excuse me, & know that I cannot help it. my dear dear father farewell.

My dear Father,
        Sally desires me to make an addition to her letter, I know not as yet what she has written, but suppose she has acknowledge the receipt of thy welcome letter, which came last evening, & which communicated the pleasing intelligence of your safety at home, & also of the welfare of the families. We have been pretty much as when thou saw us, I went with my Husband to Garriroan meeting last 4th day, & returned same day, in the evening with the English Women friends, Sarah I thought, suitably & livingly concerned there, as also in our own meeting 5th day, they paid an agreeable visit to M: Dudley 6th day, had a time of solid waiting in which both they they & Mary appeared, Robert ^Dudley^, Sally & I present: that evening we went to the bridge, & left Sally there till next evening, Betsy Pim told me, they had an agreeable time after I was gone, in which Sally broke out with, What shall we render &c[] In the publick meeting she also lift up her voice with a call to us, above all knowledge, to endeavour to come to the knowledge of the Truth, & be saved, thus should we ^surely^ know that there is no joy, like the joy of Gods salvation: thou desired I should be particular in my communication of these interesting matters: & I thought her appearance did raise a little life in my mind, which seems to be in Dearths oft
I was interrupted writing, & since the above Sally & I saw Mary Dudley, who is very poorly this evening, doubtful whether it is the trying time that is come, I came home, & left Sally there. I thought to write more, but cannot so in haste
        conclude with dear love thy affectionate 
                Margaret Grubb
