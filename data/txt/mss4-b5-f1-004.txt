I doubt not but my dear Friend will be
rather surprized at opening this letter and think there is
some particular reason for addressing her at this time, it being
so long since a letter passed between us; no cause my dear
Mary but a continuation of that friendship which I hope &
believe is reciprocal, reflection often brings to my remembrance
the time thou & I first formed our acquaintance, with the
dear object that first introduced me to your peacefull habitation,
I mean my beloved Aunt Pike whose late situation distressed
us much but I trust she will be spared a little longer
to her Friends, if Providence had thought fit to have taken
her to himself, her loss would have been general, and I think
her recovery seems to give general satisfaction my poor
Uncle demanded the sympathy of his friends --
It seems time for me to say I am obliged to thee for the coppy's
of the Poems thou desired Thomas Beale to give me any of
thy productions are acceptable I think I have [insertion]now[/insertion] most of them
& Thomas know[insertion]ing[/insertion] I was anxious to collect them together, dos't think
but the goodnatured creature has written a whole book for
me, and is about to begin another - he has been poorly with a
cold this some time but I expect he will soon be better - he desired
his dear love to thee.

I have some reason to think Rich'd will have the satisfaction of seeing some
of your family at Mt Melick, he has thoughts of attending the meeting
there if he can get matters settled so as to stay two weeks from home, I
expect thou will have no objection to meet him; my Brother Joseph
is to go towards Waterford with Richd, and I hope to Leinster if thou
should see him, as he is a stranger I wish thou would take him under
thy wing; - dost thou sympathize with poor Jos Beale, if
thou corresponds with him do write him a letter of condolence, tho' he
has good spirits yet believe he must feel his disappointment, I believe
people are frequently apt to feel too much gratification from expected
future events; this has been my case, I own my disappointment is
great, having pleased myself much with the thoughts of the amiable
addition I hop'd we were like to get in our family, I say our
family because I reckon Jos: one of that number & he is so as to
relationships, but his good qualities still make him nearer; we
are short sighted creatures and know not what is for our good, perhaps
it is all for the best
I wish I could be at Waterford to take leave of [insertion]our[/insertion] dear Friends, whose
intended Journey seems arduous, but he whose cause they are going
in, will support them, it looked as if M. Dudley was raised for some great
purpose, I suppose her recovery seem'd almost miraculous, it is probable
thou heard G. Dilwin was like to go with them; -- they have
had a sick house at Anner Mills this some time back but
by a letter from Cousin Sally we expect they are [deletion]on[/deletion] the mending

she also gave us information of [unclear][/unclear] Peggy having lost one of her
flock which must be a great [unclear]try[/unclear] remember seeing a pretty little
girl when I was coming last from Leinster which I suppose was her.
expect thou heard we have got Jane added to our number, she
thrives well perhaps I may have the pleasure of showing her to thee
some time, I could wish thou would give me opportunity for it this Summer
hast thou heard Thomas Albey has entered into the matrimonial
row; I hope he will do very well, he seems very comfortably
settled; I have but little acquaintance with his Wife yet so cant
give thee much acct of her but those that know her seem pleased
with his choice —
Please present me affectionately to all your family I include thy
Brothers; does thy Sister Lydia get her health well and her dear
Children, my Brother Jos White just gone from this and desired
me to give his love to you;
I inclose thee a watch paper of my own writing which I wish thee
to accept not for sake of the gift but the giver I just thought of
it when I was scribling over this letter I had the lines & thought
them pretty so I simple wrote them down which keep to remember
thy Sincere —
