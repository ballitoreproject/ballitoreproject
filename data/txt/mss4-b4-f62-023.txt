A few nice girls of A: Shannon's being likely
to see thee on first-day, I thought I would waft you
a scrap of love in this, – but alas! I fear I am
unworthy the love of [underline]such[/underline]. My heart is very heavy,–
what happened me in Carlow seems stranger &
stranger, & [underline]but[/underline] for the apprehension of the merciful
Father of the Universe condescending to the poorest
of his creatures, & (I humbly hope) knowing that
I never dared to make mention of His great name
without believing He required it of me, I believe I
should sink below hope. I do not feel as though
I had wilfully offended, – & I believe if I could but
forget what happen'd I would be pretty comfortable.
I hope [underline]thou[/underline] wilt be very comfortable when thou
gets home, – & I am sure I wish dear Hannah also
to enjoy her home & friends in perfection.
Sixth evening. 19th of 1810.
Dearly farewell.
