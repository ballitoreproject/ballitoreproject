Dublin 6 mo 9th 1837
My dear Lucy
When I received thy commission about the
earthenware I was not able to attend to it.
I have [underline]now[/underline] got all thou wrote for except the
wine glasses, which as yet I have not been
able to match. There are plenty the same of
mine & thy mother's. Before I went to Warren's
I thought I would try Alker's in Westmorland
St. who is selling off his stock at reduced prices
& there saw, some cups & saucers, the general
appearance of which I liked; at a shilling
per dozen, less than what we saw at Warren's
[underline]& a new pattern too[/underline], so I took 15 cups & saucers for
fear we should not be able to get the same
when we wanted them, & as the whole only
came to 4/4 1/2 I thought I might exceed my order
a little; the bowls & cream ewer do not
seem cheaper than usual. I also purchased
six excellent goblets with smooth bottoms, at
8d each. the common kind at Warren's were 6 1/2
& the same I have got 9d. so I ventured on the good[deletion]s[/deletion]

one's when I ascertained the price at Warrens
of the vulgar kind. I could not get any egg
cups to match, but I send 6 strong ones at 2 1/2
each for thee to look at. they will be changed
if not approved of - The box that was sent
with Fanny's bonnet I send Alker's good in, Besure
to examine all & let me know soon, if
they are correct. I intend to send a copy of the
bill, also let me know if the ware is nice as the
young man [underline]promised[/underline] to send as good as he shewed
me in the pattern, which was much neater
than Warren's & made by the same manufacturer.
The bason & fig & chambers, I got at
Warrens; being cheaper than any I saw elsewhere -
I have also decided about Fanny's
bonnet for thee. When I found friend Honey wood
so dear, I went to Powers, in Malpas &c, a noted
house in the straw bonnet line, a kind of
wholesale place, where many of the shops send
their work. When I explained what I wanted
done, I was only asked 3/- so of course, I
agreed & left the bonnet this day. Since

thou left town I bought a pretty little [unclear]dienstable[/unclear]
bonnet for Florence, & as I thought it would suit
Fanny I ordered the [unclear]tuscan[/unclear] to be made like
it. Florences own black & white is to be turned
for 1/3.
I did not say anything to thy mother about the housekeeper
as, Eliza is at home, & apparently better, &
another reason I had, for not speaking was, thy
mother being desirous of curtailing her expences
at present, & wishing to Let the big house, which
is advertised -
My seat is taken for Enniscorthy on 7th day. we
do not know how we shall be accommodated.
no lodging taken yet, nor do we know who to apply
to about one. Just going on chance with the
Allens. I have got a new servant home
a sister of Ellen's, She lived for a good while
at B. Russells & latterly at Saml. Bewleys [unclear]junr[/unclear], being
used to friends she is neat & tidy in her
appearance also very fond of children & good
nurse-tender when necessary Richard & Ann
Allen are gone to Killarney.
Joseph Ellen &
Charlotte intend going to England in about ten
days. I do not know whether they would
like any addition to their party - Ed. Allen
has given up the idea of going -

Richd. Florence, Margt. Willy & myself spent a long
day last week at Fasaroe. we went to breakfast,
& afterwards walked to Sir George [unclear]Hudson[/unclear]
about a mile off to see his beautiful domain
& new house - we did not get into the house
but the grounds, wood, & water, are decidedly
the prettiest I have seen for some time.
It is not large, but laid out so tastefully
& with such judgment that one may be
quite deceived as to its extent. The carriage
way is so managed that we do not get a
glimpse of the house untill we are very
near it, & then it breaks on one in a very
imposing manner, with a grand view
of big sugar loaf in the distance & the
pond, with a boat on it & swans & other fowl
just underneath. The house is [insertion]in the[/insertion] gothic stile
& on high ground, but very snug looking,
Ewds house is finished & is very nice. Sally
the servant, is out cleaning & airing it for
the family who soon expect to take possession
of their new abode -
I send three pound of butter this time. I did not
find the set of [unclear]strainiery[/unclear] -

Sophia Pease had a daughter a few days ago. after
being thirteen years married. a letter from Sarah
Pearson announced the news -
I was at Larchfield this evening The girls
are in trouble again - The place is going to be sold by
auction also the furniture of the cottage & that of
the Chess rooms, which are going to be given up
immediately & Thomas & Ellen going into cheaper
lodgings The cause of all this [insertion]is[/insertion], an urgent
call on Thomas for money which he owes. I
do not know where the girls will go to but this
seems a complete breaking up of the establishment -
Thomas has offer'd 1 doz of [unclear]Gellington's[/unclear]
chairs which cost 1..6.0 each for 16/- they are in very
good preservation. I am obliged to thee for wishing
me to go to Dunlavin with Sally but I did not lay out
to do so -
Thy mother looked very well on 1st day & in good spirits
so was Eliza Thy very affectionate E.R.B.
