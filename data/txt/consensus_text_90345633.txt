there was nothing for it but
to follow - and that we did
as fast as we could least we
might be late - However we
were in time to see them tho'
in the distance and on arriving
at the rendezvous we found
members there still amongst
them Richard Shackleton who had
come out to enjoy his holy day,
and was mounted on Philip's
young filly - Philip himself
on Charlie's fine hunter and
off with the hounds ere we
had arrived - So here began
our day's ride but to enter
into particulars would take me
too long - suffice it to say
we enjoyed it very much and
were escorted most gallantly
by Richard who I am afraid
allowed his good nature to trespass
upon his inclinations [deletion]and[/deletion] by
politely accompanying us instead
