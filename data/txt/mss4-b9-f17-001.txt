September the 18th 1819
As I have an opportunity of sending
My dear Sarah
a letter in Fanny's Packet to the boys, I gladly
embrace it, by writing to you; Your kind one to
me although so long unanswered, believe me
was not the less valued, but I am sure you
will allow, that there are many circumstances
which often prevent one's writing to their
friends that in no wise influence their recollection
or affection, for them, tis I hope even so with me
for those whom I once knew and respected no change
of time, place, or situation, can ever obliterate the
strong traces that memory will retain of them
indeed I am sometimes tempted to regret that
those whom I have known for years (as your
family for instance) circumstances so separate
that we have little chance of meeting again
perhaps in this world, yet such a wanderer as I

have been from home, and its attendant
comforts, and affections, have every reason to feel
great gratitude that I sometimes met not
only, the common place attentions which strangers
pay each other, but the hand of friendship and
kindness extended towards me.
I was glad to hear that almost all my Ballitore
friends were well when you wrote, and hope that
they continue so, to any that may remember me
will you at any time give my best wishes?
I hope that your sea bathing was of use to you, and
your party, you had a delightful season for it
after your sister Elizabeth's absence her society must
now be doubly valuable, will you mention me
to her. I trust she enjoys good health, as also to Mrs Leadbeater
and tell her that I received her last letters for
which I most truly thank her, I was very sorry
to find she had not been as well as I would have wished,
but I hope she is now quite recovered, also that I never
got the second volume of "Practical Education, as I
could not find where Miss Geogh lived either to get
it, or to return the first,
I was obliged by your account of Nicholas, as it was

a source of comfort to me to reflect that he was not
totally neglected, poor fellow! I wish he may not
be the sufferer in the separation of the family
he was always most dear to me, I am sure to your
kind heart you will not consider it too much
trouble if I request that at any future time you
might write to me to let me know how he gets
on.
My mother is tolerably well and begs to be remembered
to you and all your family in which I most
sincerely join and I hope you will believe
to be with truth your
attached and affectionate friend
Catherine Gratton
When you see Doctor Davis and his daughter &
give them my best regards, I hope the former
and his wife are well,

Miss S Leadbeater
Ballitore
