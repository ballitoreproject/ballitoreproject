To Dr. L[deletion]ecky[/deletion] accompanying some of my Father's poetry
Accept the promis'd lines, mine early friend,
By my dear parent, thy dear tutor penn'd:
What tho' that hand forgets the learned lore,
What tho' that generous bosom beats no more
Yet does not now the soul uncloth'd proclaim
In ceaseless hymns of love it's maker's name,
Rejoicing ever in the land of light,
While here we combat in afflictions fight.
Lo there, while sorrows stream from many an [insertion]eye,[/insertion]
Cold in their graves thine honour'd kinsmen lie,
Lovely in life they flourish'd side by side,
Nor their meek spirits Death could long divide.
The one to pining pain a patient prey,
By slow degrees his life consumes away,
He seeks for health upon a distant shore,
And ne'er beholds his infant offspring more.
Yet there his fond, his faithful bride was nigh,
To watch with sad surprize his latest sigh,
Early in life to drink the cup of wo,
And a lorn widow's sorrows undergo.
How keen a brother feels the pain to part!
What anguish pierces that fraternal heart!
Hold - heard ye not that universal groan? -
Grief & amazement pour the frantick moan.

Yet virtue o'er that blameless breast
Shed soft the healing balm,
The throbs of grief her power confest,
Confest her power to calm.
And Taste she sent to cheer that hour
Which languor might invade,
Tho' Nature's vernal songsters pour
Their music thro' the glade.
Yet lo a brighter form we meet,
A form more cherish'd here,
Her voice than sweetest songs more sweet,
Her smile than Hope more dear.
Benevolence, to thee 'tis given
With joys of purest kind,
Joys blessing Earth, approv'd by Heaven,
To heal that patient mind.
