From the same to the same

Ballitore: 3rd of 9th month 1785

My dear friend
++ Had we met our personal communication could not have been but very short, yet the countenance of the friend is pleasing and sharpening, it whets, it stirs up, it animates, it awakens sensations sometimes that are not only pleasing but profitable. To be what and where the controler [sic] of events would have us to be is the perfection and nobility of our existence, and to lose our own wills in his will, is, I believe, requisite in order to attain to that happy state.
++++++++
Seasons of agreeable conversations between friends are not at our command, nor under our control; they must be snatched when there is a coincidence of opportunity and freedom of mind.
