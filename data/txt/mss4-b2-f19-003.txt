Dear Friend,                                                            Ballitore 6/10month 1769


+++ I am pleased to hear that thy health is rather better. We get many mementos of our approaching dissolution. I wish we may draw proper documents from them. Good and gracious is that Being which^who is mixing our Cup of Life for us with bitters as well as sweets, in order that we may not be tempted by the agreeable part of it, to rest too much contented therein but tasting also of the unpleasant alloy, may be the less grieved to leave it, our affections more weaned from it, and our spirits may have a keener retu[rn] for a state of perfect and unmixed happiness. Many certainly are the troubles of one sort or other which attend us. Tis our Wisdom, our duty, our interest to seek diligently for ourselves that Peace which overbalances them all. I sincerely and cordially desire that it may be the companion of thee and^of thy dear companion, through the viss vicissitudes of this uncertain life, and be with you and us, especially at the close of all, when all other stays and helps will fail.
