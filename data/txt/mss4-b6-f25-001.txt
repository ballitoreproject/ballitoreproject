Continued from our last (sent by
J Todhunter)
I had not long despatched that letter when
the sound of J: Williams's carriage drew Eliz
& me to the door. It was near ten o'clock at night
Jane called out, "we have him," & instinctively, &, as
if drawn by something irresistible, Mary Doyle Eliz
& [deletion]me[/deletion] I moved onward, tho' it rained a little. Mary,
I suppose all who saw the chaise ran. We did not
mean to intrude on the first burst of poor Margaret's
joy, but Eliz: hear her say, "My poor child!" We
stopped outside the door. Margt & Jane came out to
us, & in we should go. Bess came too. Isaac's face
was radiant with joy, he looked as joyous as any
of them. Joseph is a well looking young man

There was a fine fire, the supper table laid, & Susy
was despatched for porter. It was delightful to [insertion]see[/insertion] people
so truly happy, & to know that many, many are
enjoying similar delight. I know, my dear Sarah,
thou who was so glad to take the news of peace
to this family will [deletion]be glad[/deletion] rejoice to know of the
completion of their happiness. This is for Mary
Chandlee too, with my dear love.
thine dearly

Margaret more composed than one could expect, indeed
quite so. Joseph looks rather fat -
