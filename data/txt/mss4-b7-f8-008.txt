Dialogue 3
Neptune & [insertion]the[/insertion] Dolphins.
N. O brave o Dolphins, because you are always
friends to men, & formerly indeed you
carry'd the son of [unclear]Inns[/unclear] into the Istmus, having
taken him up after he fell to-gether with his
mother from the Icironian rocks. And now
after that thou hast received that musician of
Mythemna, thou swammest into the Janarum
with his musicians dress & harp neither
neglected him perishing with impunity
by the sailors., D. Do not wonder o Neptune
if we do good to men seeing we were made fishes
from men. - N. And truly [unclear][/unclear] proving Bacohus
be desired, that sailing [unclear][/unclear] to Mythemna
he might make a display of
his riches. And having set sail in a
ship of wicked men he informed them
that he carried a great deal of gold &
silver with him but when they got
to the middle of the Agean sea. The sailors
laid plots for him. But, [insertion]says[/insertion] he (for I
swimming by the side of the ship heard
all) seeing it seems good to you & I after
I have put on my musicians dress & have
sung a dirge will willingly throw
myself in. The sailor permitted him
And he put on his dress & sung immediately
musically & threw himself into
the sea that he might have immediately
perished. But [unclear][/unclear]after I had
taken him up & placed him on my
back carrying him swam in to the
Tonarum. - N. I recommend thee for
thy love of musick for thou hast paid
him a worthy reward for hearkening
