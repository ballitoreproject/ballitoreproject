Ballitore: 9/8 month 1785.

My dear Cousin,

	I dined yesterday at Violet-bank on my return home from Edenderry -- while I was at thy brothers they received thine of 3d instant from Limerick, & desired that I would give thee some information of Tommys state, &c. His mother took him to Dublin with her by easy stages in a Capriole, consulted young Doctor Bell, & staid a few days in town, lodged at Ben Glorneys -- The Doctor had him bled, & a blistering-plaster applyd to his stomach, forbid him animal food, advised vegetables, &c -- he has been relieved in his cough & I suppose other symptoms by following this advice -- but finds the renewed application of the blister very painful -- His appetite seems tolerable, his rest pretty good, he does not cough much at nights, nor has (I apprehend) much of any hectick [?] heat -- both he & his mother have been rather poorly since their return from Dublin, which was 6th instant -- he complained a good deal of head-ache, & was rather drowsy -- he walks & rides a little about, but is very weak -- his blood I understand was not good -- he does not look very badly -- his eyes lively -- he & his parents pretty cheerful -- I believe entertain hopes of his recovery -- On the whole, I cannot help being very fearful about it -- The Doctor recommends that if he should live to winter (I think), he might take a voyage by sea. Perhaps it may be consistent with the divine will to bless some means for his effectual recovery, & save his poor parents, & near connexions & friends the sore trial of the removal of so fine & promising a youth -- All is in the Almighty hand.
	Our dear friends George Dillwyn, Rebecca Jones & Sarah Grubb abode with us several days -- the two former (before S:G: came, who had a tedious time from Liverpool by sea, & was put into the isle of Man) assisted us in visiting families within the precincts of this & Newtown-meetings -- My daughter Sally & I accompanied them hence 3d instant to Sam Neales of Newington (Christianstown) & dined -- it was a very rainy forenoon -- but we got well-dried, & accommodated -- had religious sittings with the two families there severally -- Sally Neale seems far gone in a decline -- has been in Dublin too consulting physician -- she looks very poorly -- however reckoned herself rather better -- got to ride out pretty frequently -- her recovery appears to me very doubtful -- but she seems in a prepared, or preparing state -- I doubt not but the visitation to her has been in mercy to her & for Good -- We lodged at Sam Neales (his mother-in-law not worse) & were at Rathangan-meeting next day -- dined at Joss Wilsons (where they were pretty well) & went in the afternoon to Newpark (to the Wylys) -- On 5th instant were at Timahoe-meeting -- I had been thinking about that Newtown-Prosperous, in that neighbourhood, where is a Manufactory established, & where John Pemberton had had a meeting -- I proposed the thing to the Friends -- they seemed to feel an inclination to go there -- We went same evening, Isaac Jackson & Mark Eves junior assisting -- were well received, readily & willingly accommodated -- had a pretty large congregation in a convenient place, & (through the gracious help of the Author of all Good) very satisfactory (& to me even a baptizing) meeting -- When we returned to our inn after meeting we found thy sister & Tommy arrived there on their way from Dublin, accompanied by Ben Glorney -- I believe they got rain & cold on the road, & were worse for it -- we left them there at the inn, & went that night to Newpark, which we did not reach till dark night -- The three friends in their post-chaise -- Isaac Jackson, Sally & I on horse-back + Sally rode single + Isaac obligingly led George Dillwyns easy suitable beast. In the morning thy sisters company rejoined us at Newpark -- We had an agreeable sitting together after breakfast -- thy sister & her son proceeded home -- B Glorney returned to Dublin -- & our company went on to Edenderry, where we dined & lodged at Thomas Jacksons (his old father is removed) -- Next day being First-day 7th instant we attended their meetings there forenoon & afternoon, their preparative meetings of discipline, & their select meeting -- Neighbours not professing with us were invited to the meetings in the afternoon -- some came -- among them two Clergymen, as I was told -- Our friends were (I think) well furnished on the occasion, & the meetings (I hope) satisfactory -- Yesterday morning after a solid sitting with Thomas Jackson, his wife, &c. we parted -- the three friends went for Oldcastle, intending, if way opened, to visit your province -- Sally & I dined at Violet-bank, & got well home last evening, where we found all to appearance well, through continued favour of kind Providence -- George Dillwyns wife remains a while with us -- an humble, innocent, agreeable friend -- Our dear Lydia has been grumbling very lately -- We are now daily in expectation of her increase & decrease -- Frank Johnsons wife has been very lately delivered -- had a severe time -- her husband obliged I suppose to quench the vital principle in his own son, & extract the fetus by piece-meal -- Lydia was out to day on her car. I should have mentioned before that thy mother was fine & hearty -- Before I left home I received cousin Abbys letter written by thy procuration -- I suppose thou wilt have heard that Samuel Emlen sailed (I believe 5th instant for Liverpool with his son & a young-man who accompanied Sally Grubb over -- Poor, dear Samuel had been very much indisposed -- Also that Zachariah Dick & Anne Jessops are arrived in London, in order to perform a religious visit to these nations -- I hope ye [obscured by seal] your matrimony-affair dispatched 12th instant -- Poor James has experienced his [obscured by seal] respecting matrimony, soon -- I wish, from a combination of all his feelings, from the united dispensations of Infinite Wisdom which he has been brought under, & from the sum of the observations which he must have been led to make, that he [word crossed out] ^with^ his wished-for, intended companion (whom I esteem & love) may view the transitory things of this life through a proper medium -- they will see vanity & disappointment inscribed upon them all, & I trust will be induced steadily to persevere in seeking diligently after those things, which alone will make for their present, & everlasting peace -- All our dear love attends them & you all, Cousin Thomas Mark, & all his family -- We will hope to see some of you here on your way home -- We regret that we are so often disappointed of thy company -- My family pretty well -- Anna Taverner still but poorly -- her dear love & best wishes attend her near & dear friends there -- My dear cousin, Farwell
