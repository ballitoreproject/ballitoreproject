Glendruid th of 6th mo 1829
My dear Eliza
I received thy welcome letter last night
dated Inverness, we also got the two former
directed to my Mother & Emy, the latter giving
us a very agreeable account of your proceedings
among the Islands and also [deletion]a[/deletion] better news
of thyself. Thou wilt be a great traveller, I
sincerely hope it may be of benefit to thy [deletion]self[/deletion]
health, and that thou wilt come home
much better than thou went.
They are all gone off to Enniscorthy they
went to day having previously hir'd a car for
the purpose, they were a pleasant little party
and I think will enjoy themselves, I am sure
thou wert surprised at Manliffs going. I hope
he may like it, it may be of use to him
to mix a little with strangers. I suppose
thou already heard that Lucy Malone and
sister Elizabeth who was made representative
intended going. we joked with Manliff as
being [underline]guide[/underline] to the [underline]friends[/underline]. I believe I
told thee already that it was to day they
went Saml Wright and I rode with them

as far as Bonalegh they took a snack with
them and we ate it in the Devils Glen
which was quite new to most of the party,
to me at least as I had not been there [deletion]to[/deletion]
before. we had not time to go [insertion]to[/insertion] the fall which
we regretted. about half past two the [underline]friends[/underline]
and their [underline]guide[/underline] set off on their journey
intending to sleep at the wooden Bridge,
and to proceed from that to Enniscorthy
tomorrow, and Sam & I took one solitary
journey home, thou may think I [insertion]was[/insertion] pretty
tired after a ride of nearly thirty miles,
we got home to tea, and found [underline]all[/underline], that
is my Mother, Arthur and Willie safe at
home. The account of our proceedings
are very small [insertion]indeed[/insertion] compared with thine and
are scarcely worth telling. My Mother
seems pretty well she has not had the toothache
this some time, she desires thee not
to do [underline]too much[/underline], and sends her dear love
Thy colony of bees are increasing, their
being three new settlements since thou
left this, in all there are eight, thou

may say now, "My banks they are furnished
with bees." Altho' I have quoted that line I am
not acquainted with its author. We are very
small in family now being only four in number,
Arthur must act as [underline]man[/underline] of the house
and steward. he sends his love. We have
heard nothing from John or the Doctor since
they went, there was not time yet, we do not
expect to hear for ten days or a fortnight from
the time they left this, which
[unclear]wi[/unclear]ll not be untill third day
[unclear]ne[/unclear]xt. there has been a great
wandering amongst our family
this summer, and in very different directions,
some time will elapse before we all meet
again. Sally Malone sends her love to thee
and J Allen in which I join her, she received
the latter's letter which was very acceptable.
We have had very stormy weather here
this some time back, but I expect it is going
to take up. I believe it is better to direct
this to Glasgow as it would be rather late for
Edinburgh, it is almost time to go to bed
as it is going to twelve farewell with dear love
thy affct Sister Selina
sixth day night.
