Dear Friend
Margaret Davis
Since I wrote last week
I found copy of the marriage certificate
of Nicholas Darrington &
Mary Bancroft: married
 the 24th of 1st mo (March) 1720.
It appears Nicholas was son of
Thomas & Susanna Darrington
of Ballinacaro & Mary was
daughter of Jacob & Ruth
Bancroft of Lambstown, both
places in this county.
I have not been able to find
any record of the Bancroft family

beyond the simple remark that
N. B was married to Mary; although
I have a book in my
possession in which the records
of births and deaths appear
to have been kept rather carefully
since the year 1641.
In my researches I have
not met with the name
[underline]Horace[/underline] at all.
I should have been glad to
afford thee all the information
requested, but I think
this is as much as I can do.
Thy friend Sincerely
Robert Copeland

Howee
