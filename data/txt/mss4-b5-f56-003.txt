[unclear]Num [/unclear]5. South Mall. Cork 28th July [underline]1825[/underline].
Dear Mrs Leadbeater
I have just passed the day with my worthy friend
Mr. Beale, & having learned the purport of a letter he wrote you yesterday,
I wish, as soon as possible, to tell you that, any further endeavours on my
part to succeed in my wishes with regard to a certain young person, will
& must prove entirely unavailing, as yesterday I learned for certain
for the first time that she had a previous attachment of perhaps three years
standing; & that even were it not so, I could not hope to win her.
I want words to express my disappointment, & the anxiety & perplexity
of mind in which I have been kept, but the honest sincere
friendship & counsel of Mrs Beale, his truly amicable wife & cousin,
have enabled me to support all with patience & resignation; and
as it has not been the will of the Almighty that I should succeed, I endeavour
as much as my feeble reason will permit to commit myself with resignation
& confidence, & all my cares & concerns into his hands, believing that He cares
for me, & ever wills my true happiness: nevertheless I feel most keenly the
disappointment, & perhaps it is only Sad necessity that dictates to me [unclear]resignation[/unclear],
when I feign would believe that it is a disposition to fulfill the will of Him.

whole goodness & mercy had so long & so frequently been extended to me through
life; indeed were it not for this doubt as to the motive of my resignation I
feel I should be more hearty in it. --but, my dear friend, is [insertion]it [/insertion]not true
that whatever is - is right? & if so why should I [unclear]repine[/unclear]? All is for the
best, & all things shall work together for good to them that love the giver of all
good. -- I cannot tell you, dear Mrs Leadbeater, how obliged I am
to Mr. Beals & family; his friendship has known no bounds, & has more
than once surprised [insertion]me [/insertion]to a very great degree - there is so little like it, &
so few friends like him in the world!! - The idea of [insertion]not [/insertion]having been able
to Settle myself near [underline]him [/underline] had not a little added to my disappointment. I
have a secret delight in his converse that I never before experienced
with any one; indeed I may safely say that until I met him, I have in a
great measure lived isolated from the world, altho' apparently
drinking deep of its pleasures, which years ago I would, as well as now,
feign forego for something more staple, more agreeable with the
bright hopes of a happy Eternity. -- I go [underline]to breakfast[/underline] with him very often,
but dinner & tea hours are passed away ere I percieve that it is
time for me to be going. --His child is one of the finest I ever seen, &
good temper'd beyond measure, with a most lively & expressive countenance
I hope this will come to your hands ere you put yourself to the trouble
of advocating my cause at Newington, for I feel it would be of no use, & might
irritate the young person, whose previous attachment is not quite as respectable
as one would have supposed, & highly displeasing to her family, but she
has seen thirty one years pass over her head, & of course, is entirely guided

by reason, -- if reason ever meddles in such things.
The post is just going out, therefore, I hasten to finish
altho' I have a host of things to say, but this one I must not neglect, which
is, that to you, my dear friend, I feel infinitely & sincerely obliged for
your long & steady friendship towards me, both in will & deed, & also
to my good friend Sally Shakelton for having made me acquainted with
Mr. Beale & family; indeed I feel more than I can express, & that
one of the society of friends shall ever find, as they have hithertoo, a
ready pasport to my heart,
& affections. -- I love their very
dress, how much more themselves!
Adieu! My dear Mrs Leadbeater,
My kindest regards to Sally Shackelton,
Mr. Leadbeater & all your family
who I hope are, with yourself, in good health
& spirits, do not forget me to [unclear]R.. [/unclear]Shakelton & all friends at Ballytore
& believe me to be your much obliged
& affectionate friend
[unclear]Jas. N. [/unclear]Graydon . --
