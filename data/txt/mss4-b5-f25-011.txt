Dear Cousin
I have just arrived in this
City, to which place I am come with
an intention to make some purchases
of Linen Goods & purpose staying
all next Week; before wch time expires
I hope thou wilt be able to write me
to ye care of P & J Crawford Brokers Dublin
giving me an acct of your welfare as
to Health &c wch will be some gratification
to [deletion]the[/deletion] me; altho' far short of
that wch I believe I shd receive, wd time
& circumstances allow me to pay you a
visit - wch must now be defer'd more [unclear][/unclear]
another year; as I do not expect to visit
This Country again till abt. 15 or 16 Months.
I have been from Home some Weeks
in Scotland on business & got a good
passage of 6 Hours to Donaghadee -
I stopd very little in ye North, only calling
at Belfast & Lisburn - Perhaps thou
mayest not have heard that Aunt Shackleton

Died at York ye 2nd of last Month
having for sometime back been indisposed
from a Cancer in her Breast -
she was over at Leeds a few Months
before her Death, consulting one of our
most eminent Surgeons - but it was too
far gone to have much Help from them,
she was a good deal concerned when she
found herself so circumstanced - & I hope
she was in some measure concern'd to be
prepared for her change - wch took place
sooner I believe than she, or we expected.
My Family were all well when I
left home & my Eldest Son who is out on
Apprentice have seen since; who with
myself am well; Wish I may reseive as
favorable an acct of thy Connections and
Family to whom as Oppy offers please to
make my kind respects: tell Cousn Sarah
In Broadhead & his Wife were both well
when I left home; we sometimes speak of

her, when we are talking of this Country
as I spend an Hour there occasionally,
who are very valuable Frds in my opinion
I think thou art not acquainted with
them - Benj North is ailing at times
John Armitage ye Elder who lived at
Selby & who has lived with his Son John
at York for some years, Dead ye Day after
my Aunt S. - & whose Funeral I also
attended - he was an innocent Old Man I
really believe - Some of my Relation
from Sheffield & Hull were well [unclear]a[/unclear]
a Month ago, as I had an Oppy of meeting
them at York, when attending our last Quarterly
Meetg - (I say our, because I enjoy &
I hope shall prize the priveledge, of being
again reinstated to (& I believe much united
with) Friends ⁠—) Eliz Coggeshall & Martha
Routh was attending said meeting —

Letter as thou well can; as I am likely
