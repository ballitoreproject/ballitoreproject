Morgan's Railway Hotel
Liverpool
March 12th 1847
My dearest Mother
Here we are
safe & well with our breakfast
in prospect we had a good passage
and were not sick - no one
onboard was sick still the vessel
rocked a good deal in the night
so I almost feared I should roll
off my Sofa - there were six or
seven ladies besides myself -
Thos. did not go to bed 'till nine
oclock but I went at once
which was a good means of
keeping well - I slept some
towards morning & was asleep

when the Stewardess came to
say it was time to get up -
We are in a Hotel close by the
Station House and have washed
and dressed and are now waiting
for our breakfast to be brought
up - writing beside a snug fire
which is a kind of grate
I never saw before & wh is very
[insertion]on a[/insertion] nice plan with regard [underline]to hobs[/underline]
but which I have not time to
describe - I never saw so dirty
a house maid in Ireland but
I suppose she will be quite trig
by & by as I see the waiter has
made his toilet - There
was a very heavy shower of
Hail in the night - the morning
when we got up was one
of the finest I ever saw but
cold cold - Liverpool is just
what I remember it so far as
I have seen - Birkenhead grown
up since altogether - I hope
my dear Mother you will take
care of yourself in my absence
and let me have nothing to
regret in that way by leaving
home - I trust all will keep
well whilst we are away
and with dear love to you every
one I am your affectte daughter
EH

I suppose it was the seasoning
I got in the Yacht prevented my
being sick
