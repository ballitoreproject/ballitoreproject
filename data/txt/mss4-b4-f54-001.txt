per favor
Miss Armstrong

My deer Mr Shackleton,
I lament going
away without having the
pleasure of seeing you - but
have been hurried beyond
measure this morning - Accept
my kindest wishes for
your re-establishment - and
for our meeting in some
place where I can be more

[unclear][/unclear]
free than my various
engagements to the intimacies
of former days, many of
whom have come from Ireland
to settle here, would permit,
to settle here, would permit -
especially when united with
the time. LaLeen up by my
present cares of my health
Give my best regards
to Miss Orpen, and your
excellent husband - for
such I am sure he is.
such I am sure he is -
Be careful of your Mr
and accept a little
Keepsake to remind
you of your dear Mr
Shackleton, very faithfully
Milircain French
Tuesday Even -
