Office [unclear][/unclear] G- 1836
My dear [unclear]Fecine[/unclear]
For a long time
& indeed until pretty lately
I used almost always to answer
letters the day I received
them & I think it is a good
plan for one at least of a
pair of correspondents - it might
be considered too thick a discharge
of epistles if both
followed that system so I
will not ask thee always
to reply so soon though the
oftener the better- Well
after this preamble I may
tell thee that I was glad
to see they handwriting on
a letter to day without
the little [unclear][/unclear] in the
corner - I did not get
it till my return from
Belfast where I went early
this morning to attend poor
Alfred Pim's funeral - perhaps
[unclear][/unclear] thou did not hear
of his death - thou remembers
who he, was, the nice young
