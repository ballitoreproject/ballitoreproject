Esteemed Cousin/
Thy kind Letter by John Birkbeck came
safe to hand - I had almost drop'd all hopes of receiving
the Favour of a line from thee, & begun to imagine I had
made too free with thee in writing so long a letter, being
[underline]personally[/underline] unacquainted with thee &c, but was most agreably
convinced of the Contrary by the receipt of thine - It gives me
great Pleasure to find myself so kindly remember'd & acknowleg'd
by a Relation, at such a Distance, & tho' it may phaps never
be my Lot to see thee or any of thy Family (an Event I shou'd
much desire if there was any Probability of it) yet it will ever
give me Satisfaction & Pleasure to receive a Line from
any of you. - I wish (dear Cousin) it was in my
Power to give thee a more agreable Acct. of our Family than
I can at present, my Brother has been much encouraged by
my Father's Friends in his Business &c has had a good School
was very hopeful & we had the pleasing Expectation of seeing
him agreably married before now, as he paid his addresses to
one of Thos. Rebanks's Daughters, a young Woman of an amiable
Character, but when he imagins himself upon the point of
succeeding there the match was abruptly broken off, for which
the young Woman has been a good deal blamed even by her
own Friends, as not having treated my Brother altogether
discreetly in the affair - be that as it may, he has been
much unsettled since, in all Respects, talks of declining his
School & does not apply himself to his Business Duty
so well as he ought to do - My Sister who still lives
with him (has I beleive) endeavour'd to promote his real Interest
& discharge her Duty to him, & those under his care to the best
of her Power, & her Conduct has been such as has gain'd
her an Esteem & Respect amongst her Friends which I hope

she will take due Care never to forfeit, - [unclear][/unclear] have [unclear][/unclear] in some Trouble & Perplexity, occasion'd
by an unlucky Accident which has lately befallen us, a few Months ago (tho' we live in the publickest part of
the Town) [insertion]we had our little shop broken[/insertion] & Goods to a considerable Amount taken from us, some of which we had got in from London
that very Day, & notwithstanding the most diligent search both in the Town & Country about we cou'd never
meet with any Intelligence to our Advantage, but were obliged to set down at last with both the Loss &
Trouble attending a fruitless Pursuit after it - but bad as it is, things might have been much worse, for
we had as much left as has enabled us further to, to answer all just Demands & Payments as they came due, which
is great Comfort to me, & for which I hope I shall always be thankful, & hope kind Providence will assist our
honest Endeavours so as we may still continue to do it, for I think I desire nothing as to this World for myself
& Children but just that we may have a putting on thro it with Honesty & some degree of Reputation -
I wish the many Difficulties that occur may have the proper Effect, by directing us to place our Dependance
upon a surer Foundation than worldly Enjoyments, which are but at best too transient & uncertain as almost
daily Experience shows. - I shall at all times (as above hinted) be glad to hear from thee or thine & more
especially as we have so few Relations left of my dear Fathers side, & indeed tho' we have an own Brother
of my Mothers who lives so near us as to come generally oftener than once a week to Town, yet he seldom
looks in upon us, nor has ever taken much notice of any of us since my Mother's Death, tho' she left us
so very young, but he has been very successful as to this World is posess'd of a plentiful Fortune & looks
rather too much above us for so near a Relation to do - For my own part I often think, my situation in every
Respect considered, I am more desolate than many, tho I must with gratitude confess Friends in general behave
to me with more regard & kindness than I have any right [deletion][/deletion] to expect so they shou'd, which is not only
a Comfort to me, but will I hope be a call upon me to endeavour to render myself more worthy of
their kind Notice than I have been, & to do nothing further to set myself more at a Distance
from them than I have already done

I have writ a tedious letter & phaps it may not come to thy hand
as I did not direct the other, [insertion]myself[/insertion] & know not whether the
Superscripsion of this will be particular enough for the right
Conveyance of it, as I know not in wt. part of Ireland you
live, so shall not be certain of its reaching thee till I have
the Pleasure to receive a line from thee - I am with love
to thee thy Husband & Children in which my Husband & Brother
& Sister join me thy obliged Frd. & kinswoman
