Dungannon 17th 2d Month 1776
Dear Richard/
Thine of the 8th Came here in Due Coarse, Contents duly note, as To Peggy I Love her, but She must Trust me I dar not force open ^the^ door that leads to Holy Things; and as to false Keys I disaprove the use of them; Sacrilege in Every Shape Tho Knows I am Principaled against, and indeed my mind has been so Unhinged and distressed about W, Neiles affairs and the Consequence, that Tho not Imediatly Concernd sy Self I seem to feel his and his Creditors feelings in such manner as has Renderd me allmost unfit for other feelings for some time part, I spent the most of last Week there ^(in Lisburn)^ Left it last first day morning took Lurgan meeting in my way home which Proved to me a meeting beyond Expectation the Words,, Now Shall I give Thee up Ephram,, &c was brought to my Rememberance with much Life and spread from Little to more until I thought the whole meeting was Coverd my own mind was however so Refreshed that I came home Chearfully Tho Alone That Evening; but where am I now wandering to?
	I have Nearly Return between us in J, Ps hand or what is the same under from a house in England to Draw on him but as the goods were but Lately sent I would Rather Chose to Indulge my friends a Little Longer if Thy Occation be pressing I shall Remind Thee Otherways Though I Lent Two hundred Pounds ^at Interest^ Sence I Wrote ^Thee^ Last not doubling but the Latter End of 5 or begining of 6 month would do Thee as well as now but as I said before a dificulty must not be Thrown in the way by me
	Thy Sentaments Concerning Edward Hatton Coincide with Mine I Thought of Jonathan Churchmans Expression when I heard him in Dublin Viy,, He loved to hear a New Born Child give a good squall,, I wish however he may be left to feel his own feet for notwithstanding I believe the North is fully mature, strong Children may be hurt in the Nurseing as well as Weak Ones, Gamaliels advise is good in many Cases,
	It gives My Mind Sencible Relief that my Early feelings Concerning the Nomination for the National Meeting ^Visit^ are spreading and taking hold of the Minds of other Friends, the People are Too Many,, The People are Too Many,, has Turnd I think nearly as often in my mind as I have thought upon the Visit, Though wants me to be Honnest and Write or Speak My feelings to Others, but I must feel it my duty so to do, before it will be honnest in me to do it, feeling has no fellow? it will Convince when words from Another may be Called in Question, and long hang in the doubtfull seals; but feeling Plumps down all at once, Conviction then lays hold of the mind, no more of the doubting Spirit Remains; Sencible feeling Swallows all up and digests what has been long doubted. My Friend; many have got into Moses his Seat, but are strangers to the Dear mans meek Spirit, Elders have been Appointed and fresh Nomination of Elders have been Urged, until they have drawn Each other Head & Shoulders into office, but Alass; But Alass; many of them want Prowess Capable of feeling the Word, and much more incapable of availably Prescribing for the Hurt of the Daughter of Our People, Skillfull Physicians Enquire with Care, and Prescribe with Caution, But Intruding Quacks and Pretenders, are for Curing all, and in most Cases, With Nostrums of the Same, or nearly the same Compound, gathered perhaps from the Writings or Words or others, for as to anything now of their own, they deal not in Simple New things, But Where am I Again Rambleing; I am Confined to my Room with an Attack of the Rheumatism which took me last night in the Joint of my Right shoulder just where it held me about a Month Two years Agoe, and fixed me on my Back in bed, however it has not wholy deprived my hand of it Cunning[?], yet, what it may do I must Leave & with Dear Love to Thee & Thine Remain Thy Affectionate Friend
