Dear Friend & Cousin,
Tottenham, 5mo. 31st 1814
Having been, once more, favoured
to attend our Annual Assembly, through all its sittings,
from its commencement to the close, including divers Committees,
&c. wherein I was engaged. I came down last evening,
after the Select Meeting, (which ended about eight),
with my much valued Friend,
Joseph Gurney Bevan, to
his house at Stoke Newington, to lodge: As he is a character
of no small celebrity, as an Author and a Friend, probably
thou hast heard of his being almost totally deprived
of sight, and much debilitated as to bodily strength; nevertheless,
he is yes alive, in the best sense; and, I have a hope, may
be again, in measure, restored; though, by some, if not by himself,
it may be thought a hope against hope.
I am now on a visit to my Relations here, impressed I
trust, with a degree of thankfulness for the continued enjoyment
of fine health, my advanced age - within a few months of Eightly
considered. My Cousin William Forster Senr. at whose house
I am, with his Family (his devoted Son, William junr., now with
you, only excepted) desire to be remembered in love to you all.
Meeting here also with our Friend Robert Fayle (a Relative, too, by
marriage) though straitened for time, I take the opportunity of
acknowledging the receipt of thy kind and intelligent communication,
of the 22d ult. - I am obliged by the particulars concerning
the different branches of your Family and Connexions; and
by all your affectionate remembrance of me: I rejoice in the renewed
prosperity of the School, &c. for I continue - as it behoves me to
be feelingly interested in, and, I think I may say, at times, anxiously
solicitous for your welfare in every respect: desiring above
all things, that you and yours, with me and mine, may be
found, of the Father, true spiritual worshippers; of Christ, his followers,
in meekness and lowliness of heart; and, withal, humbly
grateful for the many unmerited favours and blessings bestowed
on us by the Great Author and Giver of all Good: And I do
sincerely and tenderly sympathize with thy Brother and Sister
Chandlee in their afflictions, and with dear Sarah; hoping they [insertion]each,[/insertion]

each, find the [underline]best[/underline] Friend, the Good Samaritan, near, to administer
relief; to pour in the wine and the oil, and to bind up their
wounds: This portion of Scripture frequently affords me encouragment
and comfort, with heart felt assurance that there
yet is "balm in Gilead, and a Physician there". Do give my love
to them; not forgetting Hannah Haughton, Anna Taverner, or
other Friends, if any remain that can recollect me.
It is expected that dear Stephen Grellet is about to take
his departure shortly; but whether immediately for America,
or again for some part of the continent of Europe, seems yet uncertain.
I believe Elizabeth Coggeshall intends to visit Germany
at least, if not some other parts of that Continent; but no
Friends- male or female, that I know of, have given up their
names, to accompany her: It appears to be, for her, an arduous
undertaking: but He who sendeth forth Labourers into his
Harvest, doubtless will go before, direct, and protect, them; if their
eye remain single, and their dependance, solely upon Him, he will
rightly qualify and furnish them for the Work; and their Wages
will be sure, and ample.
I also rejoice with you at the present cessation of War and Bloodshed;
and at the peace consequent; but am not [insertion]so[/insertion] confident, as many
seem to be, in the expectation of its continuance: true, divers
great Princes, and Potentates of the Earth, appear to be leagued together,
and [underline]so[/underline] they have been before, promising great and wonderous
things; not knowing, or not considering, that "the lot is cast into
"the lap, but the whole disposing thereof is of the Lord."
When I came up to town, I left my Son and his Family well,
excepting his eldest Daughter, Hannah, a precious innocent Girl
about 18, very promising for Life, till lately; and who had been
his house-keeper some time, but was taken ill, and, declining
rapidly, is departed [underline]in peace[/underline], without, to me, a shadow of doubt -
happily and mercifully removed, in best Wisdom, [underline]from the troubles[/underline]
[underline]to come[/underline], which is consolatory: I went down, with some Friends and
Relations, last week, to her interment, and came back again to the
Yearly Meeting, it being only 30 miles distant. My Son continueth
single, having, now, 4 Sons and 2 daughters, all healthy and promising [insertion]but[/insertion]
but

but this loss of dear Hannah [unclear]st[/unclear] prove a great trial, affectionately
[insertion]attached[/insertion] as, I believe, all were.
I think I have, at home, a letter [insertion]from Ballitore,[/insertion] of an older date than this
of thine, lying unanswered: epistolary writing has, of late, become
such a task to me, that the neglect, or omission at least, of making
proper returns, deprives me, I fear, of many agreeable communications;
let not this, however, prevent your writing to me; for,
I think, I remain, with sincere, unabated regard for for all of you.
Thy affectionate Friend and Kinsman
I Birkbeck
P. S.
Having informed Hannah Pim of
my writing, she sends her love.
