16 meeting Mary got a young looking creature, her name Anne Shepherd, to the inn, where we dined (who had walk’d 7 miles I think to meeting) & gave her good advice; Oh! that it may not be forgotten by her: - she was warned to take especial care of her self (as she felt to M:D to be in danger) & not to desire to go out to see the dangers of the land, least she might suffer thereby, as did poor Dinah: the poor child did not seem devoid of feeling; & I thought what a favour to have a guarded education. - We came asme evening to Thos. Greers where ^we^ were really kindly received by the family, which at present has the sweet addition of Jenny Clibborn: here dear Mary, who was poorly all along since she left Dublin, grew much worse, suffered a deal of pain in her stomach & bowels; & Thos. Greer being very desirous a physician should ^see^ her, she consented for our relief, & he has order’d a blister &c: How things will turn out is unknown to us, but this I believe, that all will work together for Good to dear M:D, who is one of those to whom it was so promised, even of those who love & fear the Lord.
