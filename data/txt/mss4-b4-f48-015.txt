3/3 mo: I have already often heard Betsy Shackleton spoken of here, always
with pleasure - indeed that same Betsy seems to diffuse sunshine wherever she
goes - & often I felt dark without her. When Eliz. was at Mill-brook - every one
confined at their post - no Eben & Debh to look in upon us & Betsy too far away
& since that when poor Aunt Sally was absent far - when dear Sister Debby was
farther removed, & sorrow in consequence, lay heavy on my heart - Eliz: out ([insertion]but[/insertion] & that
was not often), when the Post Office, dairy & kitchen preferred their claims upon
me so that I could not occupy solitude as I wished, even with a nap I was ready
to query "O solitude, where are thy charms?" You do not forget us I know;
but I hope you enjoy the present & are able to enjoy it. I have struggled
much of late against recollections of the past, & anticipations of the [unclear]future[/unclear]
& I hope profitted by it. Do you know that Theophilus Holbroke is [unclear]de[/unclear]
Sally Haughton sent me a most interesting account of that event
Fisher told me that his friend Rickman cannot be persuaded but that
there is a tender attachment between thee & Theodore, [deletion]juding[/deletion] or rather from
him to thee, judging by the manner Theodore spoke of thee. Thomas strove
to persuade him to the contrary, but the man was stiff in his opinion. Has
he applied to be received into membership? Some say he has, & his letter to
Mary was written in friends language. If he returns to us a friend, his
example may do us good, & induce us to endeavour that ours may not injure
him. Thomas Harvey is in Cork. Well, farewell, & accept & divide with
Eben & Deborah Lydia's dear love & mine, also accept that of this dear, good
family. We long to know how Lydia gets on - the dear little creature
Has thou been at Harvey & Dastons?
