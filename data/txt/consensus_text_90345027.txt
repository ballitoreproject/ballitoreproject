to laugh at him to
turn away his fright
his tears soon gave
way to smiles also -
and when we asked
him how he got out
"Oh! I got out very handy"
which made us all
laugh heartily, such
a thing for a little
fellow like him to say.
He was not on closer
inspection we found
very wet, so there was
not much harm done.
After tea Uncle J and
Nannie went away.
Polly and I went down
as far as Bray with
them on the car.
