Waterford 1st of 10th Mo. 1826 -
I certainly did not, could not expect
thee to address us, my dear Elizabeth: as the
expressions of our sympathy & affectionate [unclear]Lyterell[/unclear]
had been witheld, yet I can assure thee both
were warmly excited on thy behalf and I
many times thought of taking up the pen
to tell thee so, but believe thou knows my
time is much occupied; I have a good deal
of necessary writing, and am neither very expect
or fond of the employ -- thy kind lines sent
to Cork were forwarded me from thence our stay there
was but short, my mother not having a very
extensive prospect, but she accomplished what was
before her I believe to her own peace, we spent a
few days pleasantly at Annee Miks on our return
and a few hours much to our satisfaction with
my dear Aunt Grubb we learn thy Aunt Sally
is now her quiet & have written to the latter
proposing that she should lodge with us at the

approaching quarterly Meeting - I have since
learned that she has had other invitations
if she does not accept of ours it will be
a disappointment to my mother, the idea of
having two blind folk to care for might be
a little formidable to me, yet I expect we shd.
mannage very well. - yesterday I met Sally
White on the quay, she informed me of her
intention of going tomorrow. So that a few
minutes seem all that are at present at
my command - yet I could not feel satisfied
without at least acknowledging thy acceptable
letter, tho it is not in my power to enter
as fully into its contents as I could with - the
loss of such a Mother, can never to thee my
dear friend be fully supplied. yet thou [unclear]Sorrows[/unclear]
not as without hope - and the belief that her
purified spirit, has escaped from conflict, &
is now centered in one of the many mansions
is surely cause for humble gratitude, endeavour

to seek consolation in the belief
that thy loss is her gain, & [insertion]do[/insertion]not[insertion][deletion]to[/deletion][/insertion] let thy self
yield to those desponding feelings - but try
to repose on a merciful creator; - I would gladly
obtain a message from my Mother but the car
is at the door to take us to the afternoon
meeting & she has been taking a little nap
to prepare her for sitting it, while I have
hastily scribbled. she is quite of her [unclear][/unclear]
Fort - much improved in health by her [unclear]resid[/unclear]
in the country we removed into town [unclear][/unclear]
day - one affecting event occurs after another
- M Nythers - death touched us much & the awful
catastrophy which terminated Joseph Goffs
career. Joseph Strangman has been laid
up by a blow received on the back of his
leg by a stone - he has got to ride in
the car, but not yet to meeting - My
Mother's [deletion]friend[/deletion] by misattending tone awaits
thee thy father & brother she wishes also to

be kindly remembered to John & Mary Davis
with thy aunt Shackleton &c - in much haste
believe me my dear Elizabeth thy, affec friend
Jane Watson
