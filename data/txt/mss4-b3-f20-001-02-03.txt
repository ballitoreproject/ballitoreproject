Ballitore: 17/2 month 1791

Richard Reynolds
Dear friend,
	Immediately on my return home from our last half-years meeting, I was saluted with thy kind epistle, which I found there ready to receive me. It was, & is very grateful to me, & I shall esteem it a favour to be thought worthy of the continued fruits of thy friendship & little leisure. There are many cross occurrences which perturb & disquiet, & if Divine Providence should, on the other hand, cast up some fresh means of consolation & refreshment, why should not we avail ourselves of this bounty? A new correspondence, like a new well opened in the course of our pilgrimage & dry travel, may, under the blessing & by the direction of the Law-giver, prove comfortable & strengthening for the journey. Indeed I often think of thee, & (whatever be the reason) my cogitations about thee are attended with sympathy & compassion  my minds eye views thee as in the valley of affliction  be not restless, but rest there the appointed time, & the Lord is able to make this valley of Achor (which is Trouble) a door of hope. He can cause the ground of this same affliction to be productive of the most [?] salutary increase, so that not only Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, bue ven the valley of Achor a place for the herds to lie down in  but this happy experience is for my people that have sought me, saith the Lord. Mayst thou be strengthened thus ^there^ continually to seek the Lord, who in inscru ^inscrutable^ wisdom orders or permits the close trials which sometimes best us! I know nothing we can do more likely to benefit ourselves, & those whose welfare is nearest our hearts, than to keep diligently to an holy travail & wrestling of spirit on our own & their behalf. Our own prudence & 
policy often fail, & the influence of Nation [?] itself loses its [sic] sway were it has ^all^ right to rule & govern; but even the Kings head is in the hand of the Lord; as the rivers of waters He turneth it whitersoever He will. I was pleased that thou hast got out on church-service  I am persuaded that no worldly business details thee at home with the consent of thy will, & I doubt not but it is (as it certainly ought to be) thy studious endeavour to get thy head, hands & feet (as I believe thy heart is ^already)^ loose & become more & more the Lords Freeman. Remember the call, Shake thyself (not only from the grosser & more defiling parts but) from the dust, O Jerusalem  & loose thyself from the bands of thy neck, O captive daughter of Zim  there will be a putting on strength & the beautiful garments  then will be ^a^ receiving the gift in perfection, & exercising it to the honour of the Giver, as well as to concomitant & consequent sweetness & peace  then previous virtue is known to go forth from the holy One, as through the vehicle of a refined & purified spirit, to others, & there is a rejoicing together in the Great Masters name. Thus wilt thou more & more rise in the dominion of Truth, & get atop in thy mind over those things, which would agitate & annoy, & dislocate from the proper centre  thus, [page number] 295 however useful thou mayst have been in civil & religion life, thy last days, will, by the increase of living sap, be thy best days, thy end will be comfortable & happy, & thy example live in sweet memorial among future generations. So be it! saith thy truly affectionate, faithful friend.
	Thy letter seemed to congratulate us on the return of our dear friend Sarah Robert Grubb, but see what a state of existence we are in, how transient & uncertain  she just got to our national meeting to deliver up her certification; gave a short, simple account of their visit to the continent, spoke ^as^ if herself has been nothing & had done nothing, magnified her Masters cause in several of the sittings of the meeting, went to her own home, & saluted her relations & friends there, proceeded to the Quarterly meeting, to which she belonged, at Cork, laboured there in the authority of the gospel, & when it was over, laid down her head in peace at our friend Samuel Neales, at Springmount near Cork 8/12 month last. Her loss as a member both of civil & religious society is very much regretted. But encomiums are superfluousIf we revere her character, let us endeavour to follow her example  if we are attached to the cause which she was so eminently engaged in, let us wait for qualifications to support it according to our several measures & stations. We are in daily expectation of hearing of her brother Henry & his sister Anns landing among us. Robert Grubb hears now & then from the neighbouring continent & favours us here with some account  we understand the precious seed sown there does not seem to be lost  we rather hope ^that^ it has taken root & is springing up. Perhaps the earth is helping the woman  the convulsions & revolutions in that country forwarding the establishment of the Church of Christ ++ Our friend Mary Watson is now yoked to a family-visit in Dublin  We have got through our province of Munster in a visit appointed by our half-years meeting, & I expect will shortly proceed to the province of Ulster. We looked (perhaps too much) for the assistance of dear SR. Grubb on that service  but vain is all such dependence & expectation  What is our beloved friend Samuel Smith doing? I wish his strong draught to home, & to domestick connexions, may not pull him along too forcibly, & prevent his looking at a visit to families in some places, He that believeth shall not make haste If ^[pencil] thou^ hast opportunity & thinkst proper, ^[pencil] thou^ mayest send him this hint, with my dear love, & that of all my house  We are in general favoured with tolerable health here at present  My daughter Mary was married 6th ultimate to William Leadbeater, a connexion quite agreeable to 
us, & I humbly hope the union has the best sanction. I am now I see got near the end of my paper, & I feel my love to you all there abound, & spread, & I have thy valuable wife, mother, brother, sisters, cousin Barnard, Priscy Gurney, Sukey Appleby & Anne Summerland (if still on this side heaven) all possess my affectionate remembrance. My wife & children love you, & love all honest friends. Do oblige & favour with a line
	thy sincerely affectionate friend
