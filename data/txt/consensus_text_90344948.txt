coach[insertion] which he seemed to take very much to heart[/insertion] The drive to [unclear]Mallow[/unclear]
was rather uninteresting
very tiresome and unpleasantly
ly dusty, so much so that
our capes &c &c were almost
white - it was well we
had not our good things
on - M [unclear]Warren[/unclear] altho

[extra line]
the carriage for we all
got into a [deletion][/deletion] [insertion]carriage[/insertion] which Charlie
chanced to find empty.
It was quite pleasant to
get off the dusty coach
and recline at leisure
in the nice clean carriage
We arrived at home at
about 10 1/2 ten - very
much pleased with our
trip and very glad to
get home - Ned &
