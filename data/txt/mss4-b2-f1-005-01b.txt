My dear James,
        +++ I returned hither from Waterford 19th instant along with Mary Watson [name written over in pencil] & Robert Fennell [written over in pencil]. I was favoured to visit the former in spirit, and mingle the tear of sympathy & friendship. I thought almost that I had a commission to comfort her: and thou may be sure I was willing to execute it.
