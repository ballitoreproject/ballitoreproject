Dublin 25th of 7th mo 1826
My dear Elizth.
I had a joint letter from D & Lydia
to day telling of E & D's safe arrival in Limerick
they found Lydia & hers well & mean to bring her
back with them thro' Clonmel they intend leaving
Limerick Tomorrow, - Jane Williams breakfasted
with us this morning & told us the particulars
of the fire in Cockpit lane, it was well the
barn escaped Daly at the Coach office had told
me of it before I got thy letter - the clothes came
safe, John had mislaid the key of the soap
box or would have sent it he has since
found it & I intend to send it along with
the bill & receipt by Harriet [insertion]the box is not lock'd[/insertion] the amount of the
bill allowing for discount is 1,,11,,6 so that I owe
thee 4,,6 british, I hope Marg.t is not very troublesome
I expect to go soon & bring her home
Willie is still teazed with a complaint in his
bowels which makes me uneasy

Deborah says that Mary Fisher is a hardy nice little
thing & very lively I would like to see her & Joey but
Willie is so delicate that I must give up the idea
of going to Limerick, I went to see Doctor Henry's wife
to day he call'd yesterday & told us he was married
she is rather tall & very thin extremely unaffected
& pleasing in her manners the Doctor learnd
from George Downes a few days ago he is on
his way home I believe - Debby Johnson
intends going to Ballitore with Tommy the beginning
of next month, I have great comfort
as thou may suppose, in Hannah's company
the reprieve that came was very agreeable
she was in a warm bath to day & liked
it greatly, we purpose going again the
day after tomorrow, she looks very well
but her appetite is extremely bad, we have
been out a good deal since she came
E & D went on the outside of the Coach
from Maryborough they could not get inside
seats, but were not the worse for their

journey - do not dear Elz.th let thy spirits
sink so low if it were only on [deletion][/deletion]my father's account
he can badly bear it, I look forward with pleasure
to seeing you soon altho' it will be a little pinch
to go to Ballitore now - tell my aunt Sally with
my love that when I can accomplish it I shall attend
to her commission - M Chambers & [unclear]W.m Bagner[/unclear]
drank tea here last evening Richd R is going
to London to seek his fortune, Hannah [insertion]Dewy[/insertion] Pim has
been extremely ill but is better, Doctor Harvey
denied that I should say that he got thy letter &
safe & forwarded the little parcel to Cheyne, he
& Bess are very kind thy affect sister SB
give my very dear love to my father
poor little Willie has cough'd a great deal
to day
