Dear Cousin
Margaret Shackleton
It's now, I think, 12 Months since
I was favour'd with a Line from any of you, & tho' I
have wrote either once or twice since, yet unwilling to
drop a Correspondence I so much value I make bold to
write again & Post, no other way of Conveyance, soon,
likely to fall out - David [unclear]Shaw[/unclear] from [unclear]Aiston[/unclear], the Friend
Cousin Anna Geldart boards with, was here a few Days
since, & told me she is grown very weak & feeble, but
not much afflicted with pain or Ilness, any more than
what is common to most Persons at her Age.
My Husband (who is now abroad) was informed sometime
since, by a Neighbour of Cousin Tommy Geldart's,
that he lives prettily now, & seems to do well -
My Sister Sally lives at present with Cousin
Morris Birbeck, at Settle, whose Wife died lately in
Child-bed & left him a little one, a Boy, his own Sister
being going to marry shortly, I believe, & he much abroad
he desired my Sister to take upon [deletion][/deletion] her the Care
of his House & being join'd in his request by his
Father & Mother in Law (viz. John Bradford & Wife)
Sally accepted the proposal - My poor Brother
seems more thoughtful & sober of late than he has
been, but is very unhappy in his Marriage, having
thereby involv'd himself in various afflicting [unclear]perplexes[/unclear]
out of which I see no human probability of relief for
him whilst here - I seldom see him nor ever go to his
House, I have sometime ago advis'd him against being
drawn into pecuniary Engagemts. for some of his
Wifes Family, which for the preserving a temporary
Peace he has been weak enough to submit to [deletion]sometime[/deletion]
oftener than once I believe -

But my Advice, in that dangerous particular, has been
so warmly resented by her Party, people of violent Spirits,
that he is not now allow'd to come near me, & I fear the
poor Lad is in base Hands, his Disposition so soft &
tame, I know not what must become of him -
As to my own Situation tis with me much as usual, little
alteration in myself for the better, I'm afraid, I am a poor
weak, frail Creature & of a Disposition of Mind so
Lukewarm to any thing thats good; & too much incumber'd with
outward affairs - thro' Mercy, we are all still favour'd with
the continued valuable Blessing of Health, & my youngest Child
being now betwixt 3 & 4 years old I have for these last 6 Months
been without Maid, which at first seem'd a little hard to me,
fearing I shou'd not be capable of doing without, tho' willing
to make a Tryall, as we have little Business & were [unclear][/unclear]
of living above it, but I now find whilst I have my [unclear][/unclear]
& the rest of us, I can with ease & pleasure do almost every
thing but wash for my little Family & [deletion][/deletion] tolerably so
I have somtimes rather murmur'd at the want of my [unclear]Arm[/unclear],
but, shall never more repine on that account for now that
I'm put to it, I can do surprizingly, I think its now become so
easy to me that I find very little want of it -
My Uncle Foster has been very poorly, as now better in
Health, but has quite lost the sight of one Eye, gradually
& the other very dim, which makes him very low spirited -
John Squire & his Wife were both well lately
My very dear Love attends thee, thy Husband, Son & his
Family, I shou'd be very glad to be favour'd with a few
Lines from any of you when you find freedom to
write - please to give my dear Love to Cousin
Mary Barnard & [insertion]my[/insertion] Daughter Rayner, Wm. sees't her,
shou'd [deletion]be very[/deletion] like to hear how thee & Cousin Mary
are in Health, she being poorly the last Acct. I had
I have you all in frequent & affectionate remembrance
& cou'd heartily wish the great Distance betwixt us
contracted to the Compass of a few Miles that I might
sometime have the Pleasure of seeing you all

I am dear Cousin thy affectionate Kinswoman
