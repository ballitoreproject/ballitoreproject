Dear Brother
I Recd thy Letter dated the 19th of 9ber &
was glad to hear of your Welfare and of thy
Daughters recovery the Letter I Sent by Elizabeth
Hutchinson I hope is come to hand. As to Bro
Geldards I think they do much better than
formerly we are at present in moderate good
health As touching Cork Friends proposals, I
can Remember nothing I ever recd any
Such Letter I am sure I never parted wth. any
of thy Letters And as to Jonas Bins he has
been in the South many Years, in one of thy
Letters thou Mentions thy Sending me a Letter
by Some Friend abt. Sheffield wch. Letter never
came to my hand I take it very much amiss
that any ploy Shu'd Intercept break open and 
detail any Letter directed for me & if I were
near them wou'd make them examples
for it thou may perhaps find out whose
the fault has been for I do assure thee
I am Innocent in the Matter. Julian Frankland

Family I remain wth. all our dear Love to you
