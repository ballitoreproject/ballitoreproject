My dear Selina
I have your
note of yesterday
also of the day
before - I have
just been over
at Orange Hill
& S. H. W. says he
will adjourn the
Monthly meeting
twice if necessary
- so that if the
Dublin friends
do not even communicate
with
the friends here
for a few days -
it wont cause
any delay - but
for fear of any
mistake [unclear]Love[/unclear]

wrote to [unclear]HF[/unclear]. Russell
last night & expects
to have an answer
to-morrow in time
for meeting -
I hope you will
be able to have
the 16th fixed as
the day - It would
be very inconvenient
for our business
if I were absent
the beginning of
the month & I
would not like
to have to hurry
home - the 16th would
allow me a fortnight
while the 23rd wd.
only allow about
a week & I think
this would be too
short - I could be
absent in the beginning
of the month -
but I would rather
avoid it if possible.
I have not had
an opportunity of
speaking to Mother
yet about the car
I enclose the neck
tie - also the ring
 try this one on
- I fear it will be
too large - it
is rather more
than a size larger
than the last one
you tried on -
I shall speak to
the man about
the curtains tomorrow -
The 25th I told
you the dinner
would be & that
is the day still
spoken of. - could
you meet me in
Dublin that day?

& help me choose
a [unclear]Header & fire Irons[/unclear]
for the Drawing
room & parlour
and I can [unclear]procuote[/unclear]
the ones I have to
The Bed rooms -
there might be
also some other
things we could
select -
I have had no
visit from C. F.
Wakefield or J. G.
Richardson yet -
the latter is I
understand gone
to Malvern -
I suppose yours
will be published
on Sunday - Do
you intend being
present ? I intend
Keeping out of the
way ever yours
