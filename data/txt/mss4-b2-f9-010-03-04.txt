++ I make no doubt but that thou art well aware of the caution which we Parents ought to use about companions for our children. Youth is often full of emulation, sanguine in expectation, fond of novelty, ready to form friendships. The leaven of companions of the same age is very powerful. We should as much as possible procure for our children associates that are better & wiser than themselves, & encourage an intimacy with such. But we live in a world of mixture, & this cannot always be expected, however it should be still in the scope of our views & contemplation.
		----------------------
+++ Old-Age to be sure will come upon us in a short time, if we be not first numbered to the silent grave. I wish we may all, while strength & capacity is afforded, make good use of the present-time, which only is ours. An insidious enemy lies at the door of our hearts, & our houses, waiting for an entrance. It is his delight to break down the fence, & mar the beauty of the pleasant garden which Divine culture has made comely & fruitful.
		-----------------------
++ I wish the great & repeated labour bestowed may be crowned with success  And indeed I believe it is not altogether in vain, for I am, persuaded many of our youth are under the renewed visitation of heavenly regard, & others would be in danger of a still further backsliding, were it not for the efficacy of these instrumental calls, invitations & expostulations. May we who are more advanced in years witness a being deepened in our spirits, & wait in humility & patience at the Kings gate, abide, take up our residence, tarry at Jerusalem, till it please the Author of every good & perfect gift to endue with power from on high!
		------------------------
++We are greatly favoured who enjoy peace & tranquillity. It would be well if we made the best use of this indulgence, in seeking to take root downwards, that so when the storm may be suffered to beat against our habitations, we may not be greatly missed. +++
