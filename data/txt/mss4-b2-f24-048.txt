My dear Fathers kind letter has been long unanswered by me, I am exceedingly reluctant about writing, as it is an employment that tries me, & especially as my sight is not good at a distance from the paper, therefore I am obliged to stoop to it. I have been much perplexed with a violent cough since I wrote last, but thro favour am better at present, tho but poorly other ways, my little Samuel has also alarmed us greatly, by a sort of fever following the measles, & we dreaded his declining, & had him to ride on horse-back, but finding him not growing better that way, we confined him up-stairs, & in a few days the heat abated, & he took a turn for the better, the fever now seems quite off, & his appetite returning, he comes down stairs, but looks delicate still; the apprehension of a decline succeeding the measles seemed as much as I could well bear at times, for I found he had got great possession of my affections, & therefore I felt a severe pain [?], but have great reason to be grateful for the prospect of his restoration. We have too very dull news of our dear friend Samuel Neale, we hear he is exceedingly languid & weak, & has had another operation performed on his foot, so that I often have reason to think of dear Marys remarkable dream she wrote me; I have little expectation that he will get over this. Mary Dudley & Betsy Pim are gone to Cork, Mary having laid before our last monthly meeting a concern she felt to have a publick meeting in Bandon, & E: Pim expressing that from the present & previous feeling she believed her peace in some degree concerned in bearing her company: they arrived in Cork 7th day last, & I hear went to Bandon this day. Mary is grown very large & bright in her public ministry, & increasingly dedicated I believe to do the will of her Master; we hear as if Roberts affairs in Dublin have a more promising aspect of being settled & thereby his being relieved from a load of embarrassment, which would be a great ease to them both, she has born up nobly under many trials, as I heard a friend remark ^has^ proved, that she preferred Jerusalem before her chiefest joy. I wish to hear again from you, I hope Molly has got her spirits in good order, & extracts comfort & satisfaction from her little daughter, it is I who have cause to be low, having an impending conflict before me, & so I am often, being so ^thus^ disposed at such times, & remarkably faint hearted. James Lecky called here this [seal] on his way to Cork, I wish him success, & hope it will be so, & that they will endeavour jointly to build the house in that place.
My dear Husband as usual is bravely in health & joins in dear love to thee, Mother, Brothers & sisters & the children including our Richard: also to Hannah Haughton & Anna ^Taverner^, I remain thy affectionate daughter
