Cork 21st. 3d month 1797
Elizabeth Shackleton,
my old, very dear friend,
I was much obliged to thee & thy daughter
Sarah, for your very affectionate letter; as I am now, by your
kind enquiry & anxiety about me, expressed in dear Mary's
letter. I purposed answering the former before this time; but
did not get it done, till ailment & weakness came on &
rendered me incapable. My friends set a [insertion]far[/insertion] higher estimation
on me than I durst upon myself; they do not know, how
often I wanted reminding, of keeping up the Watch so necessary
for us all: but Providence was kind in stirring
up to that duty. Particularly, for several months back,
my spirit has been anxiously engaged, that I might constantly
have the mind retired, to the Divine Gift, and that the
natural faculties might be kept in subjection thereto.
Now my request is, that it may continue so to be, and that I may
be endued with patience & resignation, fitly to bear, what
may be permitted to come. I trust there has been a degree
of sincerity of heart, but weaknesses attended; and I have
nothing to depend on but the Mercy of a Bountiful Creator,
either in this, or the next life.
As to the ailment of my body - I think it was about
the change of the year, perhaps the latter end of last, having
its like caught some cold, my throat was a little sore,
and much hurt with a severe cough. The soreness descended
to my stomach, thence to my bowels, accompanied with considerable
pain; the cough affecting these parts. Hardness &
swelling of the belly ensued, & I found a lump of the left side,
toward

toward the hip; and from it what the Doctor called, "a Cord," to the
other side, where a second lump formed. From these, other lumps
proceeded, nearer the stomach, swelling of the belly increased
& reached up the stomach to the breast-bones. The Dr. ordered
Medicine which seems to have brought the swelling down, but,
the lumps continue to remain painful, at times. I think I am
not at all [underline]free[/underline] from pain, either in the lumps, or from
wind collected in my bowels; but in such a bearable degree,
as I wish to be truly thankful for; as well as for having
every necessary supply & accommodation, and kind care of
my sister & her daughters; also, now, the company [insertion]& assistance[/insertion] of my dear
niece E. Pim, who writes this for me. My dear love is to my
cousin Deborah Neale, to whom I thought to have written
but did not get it done; I wish this account of my
ailment may be communicated to her and to others [insertion]of[/insertion] my friends
& relations in your parts who are solicitous about me, perhaps
this might be done at the quarterly meeting time. I love
my friends in Leinster, and feel desirous for their welfare.
With dear love to you all I remain thy affectionate,
but poor, friend Elizth. Pike

My much respected friend, It was pleasant to me to be employed by my
dear Aunt to write the foregoing for her. I have been with
her above two weeks much to my satisfaction. For a while after
my coming she was thought by several better, but I did
not percieve any real amendment. I think she continues
gradually to decline in flesh, & is very weak, particuarly
for the few last days. If she should [insertion]not[/insertion] soon grow much
worse I suppose I should not stay a deal longer, yet it will
be trying to me to leave her though I am of little use, I [unclear]leaving[/unclear]
here [unclear][/unclear] the original disorder does in[unclear][/unclear]
[unclear]than[/unclear] lessen, the Dr says it is on[unclear][/unclear]
Caul of the bowels. Dropsical symptoms have app[unclear][/unclear]
which are abated, but I do [insertion]not[/insertion] build much upon [insertion]what others at times say of[/insertion] her continuing
long with us-- she has left off all her little employments
does not even read. I frequently read to her,
& pass most of my time in her improving company
She has got a loose, easy kind of dress, her stays having
hurt [insertion]Her[/insertion] & her gown being troublesome; her petticoats
are fastened to the boddice as she cannot bear anything
tighter round her waist, her appetite is very poor &
her stomach frequently sickish, she does not rise any
day till near dinner time, lies down soon after dining,
& sits up again to tea and generally takes her supper [unclear]after[/unclear]
she has lain several days entirely of late, [deletion][/deletion]
is seldom up two days together, she has latterly spoken much

much of pain in her back. She sits in an easy chair with
[unclear]Hawhet[/unclear] in it, &[unclear][/unclear] kind is very dully mostly.
my dear Mary or Sarah will perhaps read this to
thee, my very dear love attends them, Abraham & Lydia.
My aunt Beale & daughters send love to you, as does
James Abell who brought Mary's letter here yesterday.
I expect, in a few days in this city, my friend Benjamin
Patch late of Dunkirk, he purposes, I understand,
going hence to Limerick, & so to Dublin, I do
not know whether he may be at Ballitore; but if he
should, I expect you would be much pleased with him.
I had late agreeable accounts from London & Clonmel.
I saw E. Penrose at Glanmire a few days ago, she was poorly in health, & appeared in a tossed state of mind, but
