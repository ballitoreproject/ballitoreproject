R. S. to his Son.
	***			Waterford 20th of Thirdmonth 1780.
		It is well to be useful members of civil society, and to endeavour to provide well for our families, in whose society we enjoy many comforts; but the subordination of things is greatly wanting among many: primary considerations rank only as secondary, and secondary usurp the place of primary. The lip of truth has settled the order, which man has reversed in his conduct. Christ says, ‘seek first the kingdom’; and assures, that necessary appendages and appurtenances shall be added. May you, my beloved children, united as you are in flesh, being united in a right spirit, seek first, principally, most earnestly, the favour of Heaven, that you may be happily the objects of divine notice and help. Solid, and arduous, and complicated are your duties and engagements; and you never can fulfil them acceptably to God and man, without the Lord’s blessed mediation, guidance, and protection. I often desire it for you, in humble prostration, and trust that in like manner you seek it for yourselves. As you suffer the leaven of holiness and pure and undefiled religion, to operate upon and leaven your minds, you will infallibly do well.
	Should you unhappily forget what hand it is that feeds and supports you, and depend on your own sufficiency for preservation  and prosperity, you are gone, my beloved children, & the joy of your father is gone with you: therefore, be ye humble, be watchful, be diligent in renewedly seeking and feeling after the evidence of divine favour and approbation upon your spirits, every day and every night, as you pass along, and as each day and night revolves; that so God Almighty may bless you, instruct and assist you to live to the honour of the great and high profession which we make among men. So be it ..
						R. S.
