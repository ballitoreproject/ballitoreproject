dear Brother
Ayrton 12th 6th mo. 1732.
We now begin to think time long since
Sister Elizabeth left us, & hearg nothing from
her, nor you, fearing some Letter has miscarried.
we long to hear from you, & of my Sisters
Save Arrival, & of Sister Margt Safe
delivery; we are in pretty good health at
present, tho' lately I have been very much
out of Order, friends here are generally in
health; Crh: [unclear]Hosler[/unclear] is lately dead; Da: Hall has
had an Afflicting time, in his family, most of
his Scholars have been in the Small pox: near
20 at a time; & 5 dead, I think the distemper
is abated. As to thy Money, may know, that it
shal be paid when I get my own; wch I hope
will be ere long: let us know if Sister
Mary is for marrying; I saw thy Bro: [unclear]Rogd[/unclear]
& wife lately, who are in health, I was at the
Assizes on act of one Law: Preston; my Sister
knows him: he was sent to York Castle on Suspicion
of haveing stolen the Heifer; D: Wilcockson
was imprison'd for: & prosecuted by the Same
person (viz [unclear]J[/unclear] Copper; but his accusation was false
& Malicious, & Preston was honourably acquitted
& I brought him home with me; [unclear]BP[/unclear]
are in health: Richard Teaches a few Scholars
at Rilston; but I have little hopes of him. I
remain wth mine & wife dear love to you
all
I was extream Sick at
the Assizes & lay at thy Bro
Rogers who were exceeding
kind to me all the family he has five Children
Hon: Frankland is return'd from America
Thy truly Lo: Bro:
Simeon Wilkinson
Ma:

Mary Ellerton is living Robt Tunstalls &c
are much as formerly Co: Ann Hall is wth
Child Brother Geldards are in health the Young
Boy learns wth me & if he might have learning
wou'd make an excellent scholar But
as for Richard I think he associating wth the
vilest Scoundrels in the Country for such a
knot of Villains we have abt us who I
believe would swear any mans life away
for money & they are too much countenanc'd by
a person in Authority insomuch that some honest
men begin to be apprehensive of some Danger
from such knaves, I have expected to have
been sworn against by some of them because
I was instrumental to get Lawrence Preston
acquitted (tho' indeed his behaviour toward me
in time past has merited no such favours
from me.) I believe it has put him to 12 or
14 charges tho' he was not a week in
Gaol; Such Mischief has come on him by
the falce Oaths of malicious persons. May
tell my Sisters Co: Hon: Wilkinson the parlor
of Kirkby is dead. Ma: Slayter is not return'd
from her journey into the South & West of England
Pa: Frankland was well lately we have
had a fine [deletion]&[/deletion] Sumer & likely for a good crop
of Corn
Tho: Anderson & Wife are well
Wm Stockdale is well Jos: Halls are well &
Mary Hall & Mary Dickonson are in health
Jno. Rawsons are well Vale
