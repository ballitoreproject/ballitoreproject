20th After breakfast this
20[underline]th[/underline],, After breakfast this
morning Georgiana and
I went with our books to
to the pretty little [unclear]Summer[/unclear]
house, where however we
did not stay long, for
thinking a walk would
be pleasanter, [unclear]and[/unclear] wishing
to explore a little, we
found our way to a
pretty glen, at the other
side of the river belonging
to the Duke of Manchester.
Here we roamed about
for I think half an
hour, and then went
back to our books and
the Summer House
