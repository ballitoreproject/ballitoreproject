Dearest Wife
I went over
to see baby yesterday
evening
I took tea with
Mary Jane -
Baby seemed
very well - he
appears to be
getting heavier
& stronger at the
walking -
I am glad to
hear that you
dont think you
will have to stop
long - I hope
you will arrange
to come home
early next week

& get baby here &
stay at home
quietly for a while
- I am quite tired
of this running
about & being left
alone -
We have the
frost very severe
 here - the thermometer
was
at 18 last night
& the night before
and 29 was the
[deletion]lowest[/deletion] [insertion]highest it rose[/insertion] yesterday
- there is lots
of skating here.
but to-night
looks like a
thaw - our
Bleaching will
be stopped tomorrow
if this
continues -
I shall send a
barrel of the
apples to morrow
to be left in Britain
St -
Sally wrote me
for your whereabouts
Mother
& Rachel called
but I did not
see them -
Tell me when
you will be
home
ever yours
[underline]Robert F.[/underline]
With Lyd in her
present state - I
am of the opinion
that I expressed

to you - that a
nurse can be
quite as useful
to her as you
can & that you
are not called
on to over exert
yourselves at all.
