breakfast to Melin-Griffith, [insertion]4 miles,[/insertion] John Harford's & co:
they follow the Tin-business; & here I now am
kindly nursed by those three friends, John E. &, S
Harford. This morning the Dr.. came again to see
me, applied a poultice & says the arm can not
be tied up to knit till the day after tomorrow.
To dinner came my dear companion, from whom
it was not pleasant to be seperated, from whom
was no complaints of fatigue &C:, but shewing
afresh her dedication had a meeting appointed
at six 0'Clock in the evening in an
out-house har[insertion]d[/insertion]by, to which several came, I
suppose mostly of those employ'd about the
works here: I expect it was rather a satisfactory
one. I ventured to go, with my broken
arm, & [underline]hope[/underline] that it was not wrong
that I did. 8th.. Indulg'd with my dear companion's
company, she thought of having a P: meeting
about 4 miles off & mentioned it, but friends
here [insertion]trying[/insertion] about getting a suitable place & failing
S:T gave it up, & I believe felt resignation,
having done her part by making the attempt.
9th.. Reluctantly parted my dear S:T, who has
left
