Another letter from Dr Henry we cant meet him now
he was I believe near being taken up - I dont rightly
understand it - he is I think gone back to Arco is that spelled
right - I dont know where we are going now - nor where
to tell you to write - Travelling all day till late at night
up again at 5 in the morning we cannot write often
at all events we wont be so long as we have been
our next will probably tell you where to direct to -
So Mr Rice was at Glendruid from Saturday till
Monday what did he think of it did it come
up to his expectations - he heard so much about
it - & R F & J all alone on Sunday what a pity
I was not with them - but I cant be in two places
I am sorry the pony fell
we cannot ride it any more
now I suppose - -
I forgot to mention the falls of
the Rhine at Schaffhausen
wh we went to see - they were
exactly what I expected - we sat 1/2 an hour in the
Sun on the Strand looking at it - that 1/2 hour cured
my cold for I got a regular Influenza while I was in
Carlsruhe, got no cold since; the [underline]winter up[/underline] in the [underline]mountains[/underline]
gave me none - Dont be uneasy about us we
are very well & safe - & I hope will get back so -
When it is 6 o clock with you it is about 7 - 15 with us
so when I want to imagine what you are about
I take one hour & a quarter off [deletion][/deletion] the hour here
very hot, I am melting sitting in the shade writing -
no steamers on this lake only a few row boats -
This is not a place for English to come - The lake
peaceful looking & quiet - The country hilly - I am tired

of the Hills & Mountains - Still I would rather
have them than the towns & the people -
I saw plenty of [deletion][/deletion] Swiss cottages but none in
[unclear][/unclear]tation of what Aunt Elizabeth gave me -
Uncle says there are plenty of them in Switzerland
[deletion][/deletion] perhaps I will see them when I go towards the
west -, "The beautiful West" - What kind of weather
have you? Winter in the Mountains & Summer in
the lowlands is what we have here - I wd like to
know what kind of a day was friday 18 Aug with you
Florence might have written to me on the envelope
sheet of your letters - the way I am doing this - [deletion][/deletion]
Give my love to all, remember me to Mr Rice
I remain as ever - your affectionate Daughter
We are going [underline]now[/underline] to Magadino & then (perhaps tomorrow) over
the Simpton this will bring us nearer home than Milan
and I am glad of it - I did not fancy going the opposite way -
I will write as soon as I can again Emily -
Mrs Malone
Dunlavin
