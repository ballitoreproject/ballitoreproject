Oh Death! how awful is even the remembrance of thee, at
an uncertain Period; how much more striking when the certainty
approaches, & by the vehicle of disease, a[insertion]r[/insertion]t near to take possession
of these tabernacles of clay, & about to consign them to the silent
grave, never more to appear in the busy scenes of life! but as
we are told "Our places to know us no more." O what can give
peace in that dreadful hour, which will inevitably overtake
all sooner or later, the courage of man, his fortitude of heart,
& all worldly comforts cannot support him in that moment
when the soul stands shuddering on the brink of Eternity,
ready to launch into that unknown state, whence none return.
Can Riches bribe him? will he respect the greatest titles?
can our friends do any thing, but pour out their silent grief?
what then can the world & all the things in it do for us,
to make the tyrant's approach, to be without horror, & a bed
of languishing tolerable. Can human Reason, with all its boasted
power, & rectitude, give peace in that awful hour? when it's
with difficulty the body can support the pains of sickness,
& preserve the mind clear from it's effects? Can Reason alone â€“
can Philosophy mitigate the pain both Soul & body must
feel

feel, when ten thousand[deletion]s[/deletion] worlds wou'd not avail to give a moments
peace to the soul? What then must help poor frail man
in that hour, & what has he to rely on, when time is about to
close, & the Veil of Eternity to be opened? Religion if truly practised,
will then stand his Friend, & Peace of mind accompany
him to his last: not the Religion which is of this world, airy
speculation & shadowy forms, which being of man will perish
with man, but real practical Religion, whereby the soul
is lifted up to God thro' Jesus Christ, communicates with
him, is enabled to pray to him, & to know the baptism of
the Holy Ghost & fire, to cleanse & purify our hearts, whereby
we are strengthened to perform what is pleasing in his
sight, to take up the cross to our corrupt wills & inclinations,
to walk righteously & soberly in this present corrupt age,
to keep ourselves unpolluted by the things of this world,
which will if adhered to, assuredly bring that peace of mind
which will accompany us thro' this Veil of existence, & cause us
to tread the paths of life with safety & pleasure: [underline]it[/underline] will [insertion]support[/insertion] us, when
affliction may be our lot, & a bed of languishing our portion;
& finally at that thrice awful period, when it may be said
"It

"It is finished; & all the enjoyments that the mind cou'd
have wished for, will terminate in empty nothing. Then - then
it will be a fountain never to be exhausted of holy joy to the
conscious soul, & enable it to triumph at the last gasp & say,
"O Death, where is thy sting! & O Grave, thy Victory!" And even
accompany the soul to those immortal shores, where peace
shall be it's portion for ever.
