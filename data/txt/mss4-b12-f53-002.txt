description: My dear wife was then, & had been for some time,
in a weak and declining state of health, which rathar increasing,
I was not easy to be so confined from her as the school
obliged me, wherefore, I quit the school, & all other business, to
be with, & wait upon her. We went in a chair to our yearly meeting
at Philadelphia, tho she was very weak when we set out,
(having just recovered from a pretty sharp turn of illness) but
she seemed to recruit a little for a few days, and attended meetings
every day, except one she staid with me, I being very
unwell; we were from home about a week: she tried various
medicines, but her disorder being of the consumptive kind seemed
from the first to resist all means, yet was favoured to be
very free [insertion]for the most part[/insertion] from pain or sickness, she was much attended with
a slow wasting fever & night sweats, with a moist cough, so
that she gradually grew weaker, and weaker, tho would sometimes
for a few days seem to mend, and renew hopes of her recovery,
and neither she nor I had any settled sense given us, that
the time of our separation was near, yet from her encreasing
weakness it appeared in all human probability likely, and
I feared it, & my fears were encreased from the sense of my
unworthyness of such a mercy as her being continued, when
she was so ripe for removal - I took her out in a chair
when she was able & we rode about a mile the week before

before she died; she was much exercised inwardly in waiting
for, and feeling after the supporting presence of her heavenly
beloved, who was often graciously near, & tho she was withheld
from knowing her dissolution was [deletion][/deletion] nigh, yet she several
times said, "it is well to be ready, when we are fit to die we
are fit to live, & not till then"; & at times expressed that she
saw nothing in the way, but had a comfortable evidence
that it would be well with her - She was dressed and sat
up more or less every day till the last four days - On first
day night the 8th of 11 mo she slept well most of the night, &
seemed much refreshed the next morning, and better than
she had been for a considerable time, but the next night
she altered much, and began to fail in her speech, so that
it was at times with difficulty I could understand her, but she
recovered a little towards morning, but for several hours her
memory was a good dale suspended; she lay this day in much
innocent sweetness, often dozing tho got no sound sleep, & continued
so through this night, next morning being fourth day
of the week she spoke pretty clearly and chearfully to me
concerning some particular matters, after which she seemed
intirely easy, but did not still apprehend her end was so
near, yet said she never felt so weak before; she lay much

much as she did yesterday, often at intervals in a very endearing
manner, manifesting and expressing her continued
faithfulness of affection for me, and said she believed none
ever lived happier in a married state than we had done;
and seeing me deeply affected, she most affectionately expressed
her willingness & desire if the dear master (her
usual appellation) pleased, to continue her stay longer with
me, but on no other account, for there was nothing else in
the world for which she had a desire to live, but desired
me (as she often before had done) to be resigned & give up
freely, this night she dozed some but got no refreshing sleep,
and towards morning had several very sick fits, they lasted not
long, but her speech was much altered, & from this time we
could but just understand her, yet she manifested an innocent
and affectionate sweetness & composure of mind;
& it being 5th day about meeting time, several friends being
in to see her, she desired they might not stay from
meeting; she gradually weakened, & about 12 spoke no more,
but became powerless to move & took no notice of what
passed, and like one in a very deep sleep, appearing insensible
of pain, & continued thus about 28 hours without much
alteration, which was to me a trying time not to be described,
yet was helpfull for the weaning & begeting resignation, which
