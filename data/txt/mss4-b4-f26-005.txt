My dear Sister
If I said any thing that savoured of ubbraiding
or jealousy in my former letter forgive me, I wish every disposition
of that kind to be dispeled my heart, & the Prince of Peace to rule &
seign [insertion]there[/insertion] what an happy state would this be to witness, let us seek
as arduously for it, some time my poor heart is more desireous to obtain
the bread that nourishes to eternal life that out outward injoyments, & this
expression has been brought to my mind, "Which of you if your son ask
bread would give him a stone" & surely outward posessions (which too
ought to be received with thankfulness) are like stones in comparison
of that substantial heavenly food.
We resign thee shearfully this small portion of father &
mother's company yet took forward with an hope of soon enjoying their help
and company, mother I am certain will lead an helping hand to thee
as far as her abilities extend, I am concerned to hear thou hast been
so pestered with that woman, she most be vastly high to refuse doing
what thou bid her, a smarter mistress would suit her better: It is
satisfactory that Sasy continues agreeable an trusty perhaps she may

be capable of instructing an under servant & so relieving thee. Since we
are so far distant Domestick intelligence are full as pleasing as
foreign, & whom should we converse freely with if not with me another
as whose welfare should we be interested [insertion]in[/insertion] [deletion]with[/deletion] if not with each
others? Mother can inform thee of the present state of our domesticks
father can inform the intelligence our last packets produced from
Tanners end, disapoint[insertion]ments[/insertion] attend many this year, how fortunate was
thy Samuel to be before hand delays he justly believed was dangerous.
Thou art assured it would please & gratify us all to have
our dear little Abraham here a bit, I hope it will be consistent
with the will of Bountiful Providence to share him to us, yet should
it please that Bountiful Creator the fountain of Wisdom to Provide
better for our dear babe I trust he will grant resignation. I disapprove of
look[insertion]ing[/insertion] forward for future events believing "sufficient for the day is the evil
there of " & undoubtedly the present portion of pleasure is sufficient also
not withstanding all this I Some times look forward with an hope of comfort
in that child perhaps when his school days commences. I wish thee to
rub thy jars night and morning with new flannel this is Bob Beater's
mother's prescription experiences having taught her the efficacy of it
I suppose. I join thee in sentiments concerning cousin Betty Shannon
also in thy good wishes for her it would be a pity the good work begun
in her should be marred, her natural disposition I think amiable I think
her person improved, humility is a blessing with wrestling for Nancy

Nancy a sensible prudent young woman, I believe sensible of the watchful
care of Providence over them in preserving them hitherto, they both
felt at parting Joseph Garret has not called here yet we wish Betty to
go under his convoy the remainder of her journey. Aunt Carleton came
bravely home to us still continues finely, do not be tempting her
to ramble again but come and return her visit, Sally thou hast got
a good done out of, we long to see her I want her for a bedfellow
I now keep father & mothers bed aired; Aunt Fuller able to get out
once more I hope that fit of the gout was in the mean no hurt to her
she & her family I think both sincere and affectionate their love to
thee mine increases for them, We hear Molly Gough is very ill
ther much distressed in her fathers absence this day
us no account concerning her, but we hear a friend
near Carlile by name I think Thomas Dodgson is tended
his visit it is apprehended will not extend farther than that City
the good news of Mabet & Elizabeth's good passages has long since
I may suppose reached thy cars how shall we all get to Carlow
when the visiting friends are there? it is no less than our reasonable
duty to endeavour to attend as many as can when they have come
so far to meet us. I have scribbled on at a great rate,
one question yet unasked, how does like Molly Dudley as thou
hast a good taste I may answer very well. Father not being here
to correct this thou must accept it just as it is, Aunts & all our
dear love attend, you present the duty of their children to our parents
We hear Molly Gough is very ill

our love to uncle aunt & cousins if not too troublesome cousin Mary
Shannons love [insertion]to thee[/insertion] I am thy affectionate sister
We were obliged to my father for informing
of their getting well to Clonmell I am particularly obliged to him for
addressing his letter to me could any thing I could write reward him
I should employ my pen but alas I cannot -
