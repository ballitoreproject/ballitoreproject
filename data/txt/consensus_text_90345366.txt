27th.. Went down to Bray this morning
and brought the children with me.
at least all but baby - This was a fine
day - It is now nearly 12 and the
boys Avy and Charlie have just been
dancing to a quick tune - I had
a letter from Mama to day, and another
from Polly - who when she wrote, was
just resting from a
28 Fifth day - and no letter from the travellers
I think it very probable they may
surprise us -
29th.. Had a note this morning saying they
would either be home to-night or to-morrow.
for them - it is now 12 1/2 and yet no
sign - Philip has gone to bed, and
Charlie and Avy are asleep on the sofa
I had a letter from Liddy yesterday.
and a short one to day from Margt
who intends going to Ballievey next
first day, and spending a week there.
30th.. Well they did not come out last night
So here we are waiting up
