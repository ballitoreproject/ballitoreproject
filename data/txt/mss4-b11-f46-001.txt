My dear Tom
It gives me joy inexpressible to have an oppertunity of writing to my dear
Brother, & I am positive you will be [unclear]actuated[/unclear] with the same sentiments, at hearing
of the welfare of your Brother Sam, who esteems your happiness as his own your
prosperity as his greatest happiness Notwithstanding all you said to prevail on me
not to leave Ireland; yet you see like a stubborn fellow I would not be content in a
mechanical employment at the time of your departure I had every thing ready,
only waiting for your absence, & having plaid my cards cleverly I got honourably quit
of Reynolds, obtained a recommend[deletion]able[/deletion] from Capt: Schomberg to Capt: Jervis
of this ship, obtained Â£15 from Capt: Lyre, having gone to Eyre-court for that
purpose remained at the rendezvous a month fitted myself out, & found myself

Plymouth by the 4th of August 1776 In a month after I was lent to the Raisonable
with 25 men to go a cruize off the Cape De Verds, where I enjoyed a
a great share of Captain Fitz-herberts favour perfected myself in Navigation,
& initiated myself in the first rudiments of Naval Education, were out 4
months, took the Dalton privateer off Cape Tenestre, saw all the beauties
of Fial, one of Azores, & safely arrived in Plymouth-sound 9 Jany. 1777, loaded &
returned to my own ship with the merited encoviance of my Capt: & Officers some weeks

& success in this world & in case of accidence here, Joy & Happiness everlasting in
Heaven when I hope (if not in this precarious & uncertain existance) you will
meet your truly loving & ever affectionate Brother.
Saml. Eyre

Th following is a copy of [unclear]advice[/unclear] I receiv'd from our old Master Abm. Shackleton
applicable I think to you.
A military person ought above all to be most distinguished for his piety,
Mershal Turenne of France, & Col. Gardner of England were as famous
for their attension to the duties of their churches & their duty to their Creator,
as renowned for their courage & conduct in the service of their King & country -
Keep such bright models of imitiation before the eyes, & never
be ashamed to be religious
[unclear]Tarre[/unclear] fare you well
Sam Eyre.

Letter 2
April 17th.. 1779
Superbe Frenchall-road Island of Madeira
My Dear Tom
With extreme satisfaction I now reserve one hour from the hurry & bustle
of duty to converse with my dearest Brother, hoping that this will find
in America, in as good & perfect health & great spirits, as your Sam is now on
board a noble Man of War moored in Frenchall-road & distined for the East
indies, toward where we sail on Sunday or Monday next - it is nedless to tell
you I am frightened with sanguine hopes of preferment & riches - & have great reason
to be so, being most strongly recommended by my late most worthy commander
Capt. Jervis to Admr.. [unclear]Hughess[/unclear] Capt Simontor - I have been Master's
Mate ever since the first of Feby.. & otherwise much favoured - so I think I have
much reason to expect [deletion]performed[/deletion] [insertion]preferment[/insertion] in an India voyage
This Island of Madeira is a fine, plentiful Island, tho mountainus plenty
of other neassarises as well as wine. The people I believe are better
off than the inhabitants of popish governments generally are, owing their great
intercource with the English. I was ashore, had a horse, & rode all round
The Island almost, & was much pleased with every thing I saw; not that
the people ar pleasing to any means, but but my curiosity was satisfied,
consequently I was pleased, until now I have time to recollect on what I
saw; & now after mature recollection I do pronounce the Inhabitants (the
English excepted) to be a most dispicable race -. Bigotry superstition, &
knavery rinder their poverty & ill detestable however, I had a good dinner
among them at the Sun-Tavern - & paid but 4 pistorans & a bit, which
I think is moderate & we are all much refreshd with their oranges, lemons,
Bananas, fish Beef & vegitables so gratitude will oblige me to pity them
& leave them my hearty wish for their spiritual reformation - Now
leaving Madiera with inconceiveable velocity I will conduct you
back you back to old England & inform you that J Palliser have
almost ruined the nation or at least the navy. That

The ruin of this Nation Popular Clamour formerly took the
life of a brave & innocent Adml. & has now protected the life of
a man, whose life ought to the forfeited for insidious & treacherous
inactivity, & has debared & almost ruined a brave man (whose every
Member bears witness of his many brave & worthy services)
for endeavouring to do justice to his Country & to himself
May Heaven avert the ruin that threaten[deletion]g[/deletion]s us! & God knows
every honest man must admit the justice of perdition on this
deluded & presumptuous Country - Now I will with
equal velocity as before visit my dear Tom in America
I hope you are successful & victorious every where in that rebellious
Country. Success & happiness attend the British
Arms! from my heart I pray it - but with greater
fervency I must confess - I earnestly beseech the Giver
of all things to heap his blessings on you in particular
Farewell my dearest Brother & if this should be the
*last letter you receive from me, dont be afraid - if you
[unclear]never see me here[/unclear] again, do not grieve for me but hope
with me that once more we may rest from whence We
shall never part - &, dear Tom, do, & of hope I shall endeavour
that our meeting shall be a happy one, as it will
be perpetual. Farewell, dear Tom - once more Farewell
my Brother, May God bless you is the sincere prayer
of your truly loving Brother
Samuel Eyre
*Prophetical. - it seems this was the last letter his
Brother had from him for the amiable Youth died of a
fever at Calcutta, on his way home about the 9 June 1781
first Lieutenant of a Man of War, & noted for his Bravery
