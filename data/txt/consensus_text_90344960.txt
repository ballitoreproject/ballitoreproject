cinated Richard was taken
in also - so we have a lonely
house - This is a very
wet morning .
22nd. Another wet morning
I was not able to go out yesterday
owing to the rain, , nor
this day either until after
dinner when it cleared up
a little and I took a stroll
down the Avenue. Papa
and Mama came out
at ten O'clock. or about that
time - baby I heard was very
good while paying her first
visit from home. I had
a note from Polly saying
I was to go in with Papa the
next morning as we were
invited to spend First day
