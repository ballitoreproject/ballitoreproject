My dear E - It seems long since a line
pass'd between us owing to our Bay
excursion which we all both glad, is over.
Deborah is very weakly she seems oppress'd
with bile - the Doctor visits her & I hope will
order something for her relief but he wishes
to wait a day or two to see how she will be
she & I went to Hampstead to day to see
Elisa Gough who is well pleased with
her situation there, there are 6 patients
in the house, she finds Doctor Curtace
very agreeable, Doctor [unclear]Grattan[/unclear] also she
praises I send this by Henry Allen
who has been at Elmfield & says a great
deal for it I believe everyone is pleased
who goes there. I forget whether I had
any thing to do for thee in the
way of Commissions, write to me
if thou wants any thing Did Ardill
take off any of the charges?
We saw the poor old Mark at Enniskarry
one day, think I to myself he
might just as well be reasonable
he would have enough after all for
the time he may stay
ever thy SB
Edw is reading to Deb!
