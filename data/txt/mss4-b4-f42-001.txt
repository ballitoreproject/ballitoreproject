My dear Mother,
I am indebted very much to thee & my dear
Father & sisters for your kind letters, I should be
sorry my Father would hurt his eye by making too much
use of it, & [insertion]writing by[/insertion] candle light must be injurious to the sight,
I did not intend my letter to Sam should be sent in
the bag to Dublin, I believe it may be as safe a way, I
though not so dispatchful, we send them to the post
office without directions how to send them. I was afraid
when I wrote to my Father last that I appeared ungrateful,
& that fear prompted me [insertion]to[/insertion] write as I did, but
I am glad it is not thought so, & perhaps it was well
to rub me up a little to still greater attention, for I
know I am too forgetful & indolent. Unkle Ben reckons
the double sweet-brier tree well situated in
my little border, being in a snug corner, shaded by
walls from severe winds, the passion tree he set with
his own hands, & I hope if all be well with us next
spring to have them carefully conveyed to Ballitore
w[insertion]h[/insertion]ere better cultivation is: my Aunt's being no worse
is a great satisfaction to my mind, I am pleased she
& thou like the Usquabaugh, & as we know where to get
it you need not be without a supply long when that
is exhausted, besides I have still in the house two
bottles of it, & hope you will let me know what you

want, I could not conveniently send more that time & Sam
was desirous I should have some of it myself, in case
any one wanted it in our house, I suppose it is very
good for the colick & those violent inward pains. Betty's
confinement I knew [insertion]would[/insertion] affect & distress my Aunt, she
is a valuable servant, & such must be greatly missed when
incapable of rendering that service we are accustomed to
receive from them, Betty ought for my Aunt's sake to be
careful of her health, I think I almost see how difficult it
is in the situation they were in to get thro' every thing,
my Aunt's infirmaties, the Children's youth, & Molly [unclear]Norlan's[/unclear]
slowness (tho' a valuable servant also) must make it very
distressing, I suppose my sister Molly stays chiefly with Aunt
& Sally with you. I pity thy situation very much, &
sincerely desire it may please kind Providence to work
so, as to make things more easy to thee, I shall be truly
glad if I live to see thee honourably released from thy arduous
laborious station & [insertion]the burden[/insertion] laid upon some youthful person
equally qualified to fill up the place, & no doubt if my
dear Brother asks with humble, diligent solicitude of
mind, for Wisdom, but it will be granted him in his choice
& his application, successful, for that hand that points can
open the hearts of those it may point to. I don't know
what thou wilt do for a servant, I think Betty [unclear]Warden[/unclear]
seems unequal to the work, she is to be pitied, & thou art
also, I believe this would be an unlikely place to make
en

enquiry in, for my part, I am not uneasy about
a servant for myself, my contracted little affairs are
not worthy to be named with thine, if I cannot get a
friend I must only get another such as may fall in the
way, Molly Roberts thinks none of her sisters coud be
spared, & I do not desire them, they would expect I suppose
to sit at the table with our selves, as Molly does
here, & I had rather have one that would tend us at dinner
& take care of things without when we have company
since I came home last I have had very little company,
& Jack & Judy seem to do as well as in their power,
Jack goes down to the ware house to assist there, & therefore
I am more easy by his having full employment, at
present I can do without more assistance & hope when
I shall want one that some will offer, I am much obliged
to you for thinking of me. I think there is good reason to
hope Mary Doyle's removal is happy for her. Sam was
much pleased with his attendance at Carlow meeting, he
also thought it a favored meeting, & was glad he got to
it, I am glad he grows in my Father's good opinion,
I think he [insertion]may[/insertion] well be called my "Honest Husband," he got home
very well 4th day evening, Mother came a little before him
from Two-mile bridge, & informed me of his approach, she
stayed with us that evening, till near 11 o'clock, very pleasant
& agreeable. Brother John's intention has transpired, our
young Man was in Waterford, & says it is talked of there
Tom Chaylor got an account of it (I suppose) in a letter
& the young Men I am told are diligent in propagating
the news because Brother John made it such a secret &

& took it ill that people mentioned it. Sam got not cold,
he is very hardy & strong, & walks about much in wet
& cold. I don't remember [underline]ever[/underline] getting any more than
one pair of sattinet shoes from frank Ruby, I got
one pair from Ned Miles for the wedding ones, & two pair
of leather pumps & a pair of boxes, & after marriage one
pair of sattinet from frank, which thou & I talked about
before I got them, & which Betty Widdows may remember
was all, for I brought just three pair of leather
pumps & two pair of Sattinet with me here, so that
Frank must be mistaken; for I have it clear in my
mind that I got no more than one pair of sattinet shoes
(or pumps) from Frank Ruby.
I am please poor Jenny was in the way of advantage,
may it take deep root in her mind! I hope Sally Wood
would benefit by the indulgence, for I think it no small
one for thou or sister to relinquish the satisfaction &
benefit of the meeting on her account; it is a good way
of indulging servants in things that may tend to their everlasting
advantage.
Please to deliver (& accept of) our dear love as if
particularized, from thy dutiful & affectionate daughter
