Dear Friend/ Dungannon the 16th of 12th month 1753
I wrote Thee (I Think) the 10 Instant since which a pritty Sharp Tryal has fallen to my Lot which is the Decease of my Two Sons (who were all my Living Isue) They were Taken ill, the youngest, About Ten or Twelve days agoe, and the Eldest (who bore my name & in whom I had some pleasing Hopes) About 6 days and both went of Last Sixday morning, within about three hours of other and were burried & Laid in one grave yesterday Evening, it has been a considerable Shock to my wife & I, and such as She [covered by mark] can hardly bare with Tolerable patience, and the more so as we did not Expect the death of the Eldest, until a few hours before his departure Thus it has been the Will of Providence to Lay His hand upon The affectionate part, and altho it is very near and unpleasent to Nature, yet dare I not Repine at His Will, but rather Hope, This and all other Tryals which He Permits me to pass Through, will in the End work together for good, and This (in perticular) Lead me to look upon all Enjoyments here in a proper light, for, alass, how uncertain are They all, and the very Objects of our greatest delight are some (yea meany) times the things we are disapointed in, Wonderfull Wisdom indeed, who will not admit of any Rival, nea nor any thing to come near, The Love of Him, in the minds of those to whom He has calld to Leave all & follow Him
	Please let Benjamin Haughton Know I have not yet Sent the Horse to Dublin as my Brother Has Referd[?] going longer than He Intended & as yet cant fix aday, But as This is a Season that I suppose he has Little occation for him for Labour I apprehend His not being sent home will be no considerable disapointment my Love to Him & His Wife which with a near Salutation of The Same to Thee & Thine I Conclude Thy Affectionate friend
