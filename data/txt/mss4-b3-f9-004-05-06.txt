Dear Cousin,
	+++ Thy advice of the arrival of dear Samuel Neale was very agreeable. Next comes an account which that our dear friend William Hunt died of the small-pox, at Newcastle. So good & evil (as we term it) chequer the scene of this life. May we, by being enabled to keep close to the all-sufficient grace of God (the appointed means of salvation) walk so here, as that our spirits may have society & fellowship with the generations of the past hereafter! The useful, experienced, qualified members of the Church militant, reside & yield up, not the cause, but their natural lives, not to the enemy, but to death; they depart indeed, not as vanquished, but triumphing, leaving memorials & way marks behind them, that we also, who remain a little longer, may so fight as to get the victory, so run as to obtain the prize. While I write I greet in near unity of spirit thee & thy dear wife. Ye have been sensible (I am persuaded) of the call of the Lord, & the call of his Church to come, to come forward in higher degrees of spiritual attainment & divine Favour, to ascend still more the holy heights: ye have also been thus called, I believe, to take your share of the burden, weight of exercise & painful labour which attend both the passive bearing & the active meddling with disorderly walkers, & the discipline of the church, and I doubt not but ye have in measure obeyed. Let us my beloved friends, be deep be inward [sic], & bend the strength of our attention to this matter. Our stay here is very uncertain, & whatever part we act in this world, in this world we shall have trouble. If we submit in true humility & resignation to the power of Truth, so as that self shall become of no reputation, & we be [page number] 164 willing to be Any-thing or Nothing; then shall we be objects of Divine Regard & Notice, & we will ^[pencil] shall^ find a sufficiency of best help to be near, to enable us to discharge one little duty after another. But if we with-hold, keep back & preserve alive that which is appointed for destruction, temporizing & tampering with the spirit of the World in any of its various modes of allurement, we ^[pencil] shall^ be of the lame & the blind, cripples in Religion; not firm & strong to others, nor comfortable in ourselves. In the say of outward ease & prosperity, the conscious sense of our remissness will prove a disagreeable alloy, & take off from the relish of the most pleasing sensations: and in the time of adversity, it will add a sting to the sting of affliction, & embitter the bitter cup. I much desire, while I thus drop what just immediately occurs, that I may let the observations have proper weight with myself, & bring them home to my own state: for I am ^seem^ sur [pencil] surrounded with difficulties & dangers +++
	Believe me, dear friend
		very affectionately thine
