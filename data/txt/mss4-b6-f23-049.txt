Bright beams the cheerful hearth
the social band
By kindred & by frdship hither led
Enjoy the evening hour the chilling [unclear]stars[/unclear]
Unfelt by them & sweeps thro' the windy [insertion]sky[/insertion]
Enjoy the eveng hour ye social band
Smile now, for you have wept. [insertion][/insertion] What
Has not been staind with tears, [unclear] & my[unclear]
[unclear]mental eye
Turns from you I will not [unclear][/unclear]
the [unclear][/unclear]
of your delight, nor pour upon your ear
The [unclear][/unclear] sad which weighs upon my [insertion]heart[/insertion]
My mental eye beholds the present[unclear][/unclear] 
The [unclear][/unclear] coffin & the pleasing hair
which bears from [unclear][/unclear] shore [unclear][/unclear]
[unclear][/unclear]

Alas was sought in vain the precious freight
Behold the gloomy vault with [unclear][/unclear] doors
Resignd [unclear][/unclear]
Antonia while amazement & regret
Combat the truth that this array
is there
That death [unclear]relents[/unclear] from the [insertion][unclear]elem[/unclear][/insertion] north
Has sent this [unclear][/unclear] scene that
those hearts
Imbued with virtue & with kindness
warm
glowing with kind parental love should blind
[unclear]beneath[/unclear] repeated wounds, that rise therefrom
sweet [unclear][/unclear] forms in youth & beauty strong
Like [unclear][/unclear] crack'd beneath the [unclear][/unclear]
Antonia lost there [unclear][/unclear] & those [unclear][/unclear]
Thou gentle youth in virtues onward
Antonia was her parents joy & [unclear][/unclear]
grace of the frame, [unclear][/unclear] by the age
The stay & comfort of declining age
