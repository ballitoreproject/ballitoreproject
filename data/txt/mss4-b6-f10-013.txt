Carlow 12 - 2nd 1807
Dear friend
I Recd. thy kind letter with the poem on E
Rushtons restoration of sight - I neglected writing last night
then at breakfast before Ebens departure I felt a little
[unclear]nestling[/unclear] in my mind tending this way - Thy acct.
of Agnes & her friends, was very acceptable. What woudst
think of writing a little romance on the occasion - thy
ideas are so sanguine they wd. supply thee with ample materials
- I find thou disapproves of satyrical poetry so
do I - yet I think some of those in question have considerable
partial merit & justly applied, I know thy
heart is full of benevolence & brotherly kindness - but even
this precious metal will admit of frequent alloy & a
wise discrimination in the selection of our friends -
We rejoice to hear of thy Williams escape from his late
perrils - many & awful have been the sufferings of others
& why so much evil and adversity shd. be suffered to prevail
in the world - we shall not (I believe) be permitted to
discover on this side the grave, nor perhaps on the other
I expected thou wd. have much perplexity to encounter
in thy publication - hope the worst is over - and that thy
expectation of gain or fame will be realised - Poor Ben:
We also felt an incresed attachment for him when here

his misfortunes have not quenched his many amiable qualities
we expect soon to hear of an increase in his
family - a like acct. has been just handed us from our
Thos. of his Sister Betsys adding another daughter
to her little flock yesterday morning & both finely
& that Jane Fowlers release was daily expected- we
are a very breeding family & let what trade will fail
this seems to be a never ceasing one- Eben waits
I fear thou cannot read this- farewell
Sam Haughton
Ps my wife finely- the butter I expect can be had
for Mary Doyle
