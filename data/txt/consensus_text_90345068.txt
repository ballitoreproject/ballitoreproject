All passengers were obliged
and cross the town
in an omnibus.
At [unclear]Poyntzpass[/unclear] we
got out and there
parted with Jossy who
was going on to Lisburn
Uncle T's outside car
met us there and in
about two hours time
it set us down at
Ballievey House - a
fine old fashioned
house in a very pretty
situation and altogether
quite to my taste.
The country here is very
undulating, plenty of
little hills - which make it
to leave the train
