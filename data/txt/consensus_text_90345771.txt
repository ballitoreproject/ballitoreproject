20 Sunday. - Lyd and I went to meeting
with Charlie and Ned - could not
help feeling very melancholic in meeting
help feeling very melancholy in meeting
thinking of poor Charlie Bewley- - we shall
never see him there again -.
Saw Florence after meeting she looked
very sad too - they had returned early the
previous Wednesday morning from England
As the boys wanted to bathe we went
with Florence to Trafalgar Terrace where
we waited until they called for us -
Stopped at Glendruid too where we saw
Uncle A and Grandmama - home then.
to Polly and Ellen who wondered why we
were so late - After dinner [insertion]all[/insertion] took a walk
Polly mounted the filly when tired
I had a letter from Bessie yesterday -
21 Monday Ellen went by 11 train , Polly
and I having seen her off went down
to the strand where we waited until
Aunt Elizabeth and Florence arrived
It was very pleasant to have them -
They lay[/unclear] and I had a long chat - chiefly about
- Polly is very weak still.
