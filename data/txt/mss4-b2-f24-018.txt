Clonmel 8 of 8 month 1782

My dear Father.

	This day I took thy truely [sic] kind letter out of the post Office myself, & am entirely careful of it since, only imparting the contents to my Husband, I am glad to get your advice & sentiments on this uncertain undetermined affair, respecting ^our^ future place of residence, as ^there are^ so many changed & various appearances attending it, its [sic] hard to say how it will end, but I may say with a degree of thankfulness that I am not uneasy about it; if gracious Providence sees meet to spare me the company of my Dear Husband & children it is of small consequence in what House I enjoy it, (so it keeps us dry & warm) & if he is pleased to grant us in his bounty a means of support to provide for our young charge, & ^to^ live decently & reputably amongst Men, it is easy to get a House with this means, therefore there is no real cause for uneasiness whilst we have those favours confered [sic] upon us, (those perplexities are not the troubles that touch my Heart,) & it is ordered that my Husband is now in a line of business, the most sure & profitable that ever he was in, thou knows I supposed that a House divided in Waterford that my Uncle bought butter for so long, (& almost made his fortune by) he now buys for Strangman & Sons, & we are employed to buy for Courtney & Ridgway, besides other orders, so that he ^my Husband^ is like to get largely into the commission business: since I came to live in Clonmel I have never been so easy, both inwardly & outwardly, this easy, pretty business makes so little hurry about the house, & ^by^ having but one Clerk our family is snug & small, & our expences [sic] little; my Husband is disposed to make me easy, & my little Garden is not encroached on, altho some of the Children have been ill, yet my young infant is scarcely ever ailing, she sleeps almost all night & in the morning salutes us with a smile, she is really a lovely creature: tho I say it, that should not Him [?]. But I know not how long this is to last, well let things work together, & may I ^be^ preserved in a frame of spirit, capable of putting in practice thy proper advice, to keep ^myself^ quiet & still, & meddle as little as possible. this [sic] has often been whispered in my internal ear, & my greatest trouble in it has arose from secrete rebukes from transgressing against those friendly monitions [sic], I have admired that a Being so Great & so high should condescend to convey such minute instruction, as I have thought might be received: & some how or other I have thought of late a fresh visitionat & invitation has been extended to me, & a Door still open to enter in & feed as on green pasture, springs seem to be opened in the desert, & the spirit at times refreshed thereby, therefore if we have the company of this kind spirit, if he take up his abode with us no matter under what roof it is, & oh may he be graciously pleased to prevent every thing taking ^place^ in the will of Man, that would not tend to his honour, & only establish us & our House in hear fear & ^in^ his favour! I have no hardness in my Heart to any one, I think my brethern [sic] & sisters have ^each^ their peculiar merit, & are also subject to take passions with other Men, but that they are all religiously disposed, & at times their minds under ^its^ good influence. I do not hear more about the House since only that Mother seems to be removing. I believe I did not tell you how it was intended to divide the House, we were to have the back parlour. Kitchen & shop below stairs & some cellar or cellars, above stairs we were to have poor Fathers room, his closet & a little room of Beckys behind it, & my Mothers old Closets were to be made into a room, (by taking down partitions) for the children. & a room was to be taken off one end of a loft for the servant Girl: [word crossed out] up two pair of stairs an ordinary garrat [sic] Room for our Young Man, & another for a Man servant, but in this last there is so much lumber that it seems a difficulty to clear it for us, or what to do with this lumber; My Mother to have the two front rooms on the first floor, in short all the rest of ^the^ House, only I understood she designed to compliment us with the street parlour, & permit us to furnish it; Brother John told us we were to be paid fifty guineas a year for herself, Becky & a Woman servant to dine with us, but when they came to settle with Mother she would give no more than 30 a year for herself & her Maid, & ^said^ let Becky make her own bargain, & this was to board entirely with us, every meal that was convenient to her, & it was with difficulty she could be persuaded to consent to pay for the Coal that she was burn [sic] in her own apartments, but of all things I pressed Sam to insist on this that I need not have to interfere in blaming her Woman servant if she wasted the Coal, Coal being very high here. I suppose Mother meant to make up by some acts of generosity otherwise, we to have the Garden at 6 per annum. also [sic] Brother John to reserve a stable in our yard for his own Horses (I see but one good stable there) the Kitchen there, is common to all his family, & I think he proposed too to have some apartments to accommodate his wife & Children when they came to town, I asked him if this was after we were to have the house, & ^as^ now we should have none to spare, he said that must be considered of. & Sally & I must settle that, he also mentioned to Sam our paying for the fixtures; I suppose this was to be when ^we^ I had them, & were to pay 40 per annum rent, all this while I thought we were to have a lease: but sister told me she would not consent to, his giving us one, or ^to his^ giving up his dominion of Fathers house, so here it his [sic], & let em make what the [sic] please of it. I wonder what they will say next. My Husband intends as soon as he can to set [?] one of our Houses, either of them as thou advises, he says this place might do for the butter, but not well for the Corn, a Gentlewoman has been in treaty with us about the Huose, but I fear she will not take it; we hear also of another.
       I pity you about your hay & country business, the weather requires much attention to be necessary to the preservation of the harvest, I would not wish you to neglect that, even for your company, I would prefer having your own business attended to, & patiently hope the time is approaching. We were favoured with the company of Edward Hatton & Joseph Garrat at our meeting this morning, they were both engaged to labour in Gospel love with us, & I thought it a favour to have them sent to us, with a qualification to Minister to us. The Widow & the Fatherless were prayed for. I was concerned to hear poor Molly Garrats Eldest child was in a very alarming state of health.
       Thou tells me in thy former letter of your bathing, Abraham Anne & Richard have began to bathe, this morning & yesterday morning they were diped [sic] in the river, Abraham much averse to it, Anne gratified by it, & Richard takes it well, Sarah might go too, only she does not seem ot want any amendment, & her extremities have been accustomed to Cold water, she would stand in it almost without shrinking.
       I have sat up to write this long letter, it is now about 11 oclock, Sarah fast asleep by me in the Cradle shall conclude, having wrote freely, all that was in my heart, & shall be glad of a Word of advice from you from time to time, it being much prized by my Husband
       	& your dutiful &
       		affectionate daughter
       			Margaret Grubb
Our dear love to our relations there
