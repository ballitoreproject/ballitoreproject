Richmond 1st of 12th month 1828
My dear Sarah
I have just heard of an opportunity
which will bring me any thing thou
chooses to send me, so I will be much obliged
by thy procuring my things, [insertion]the old[/insertion] muff [insertion]a tippet[/insertion] & all &
sending them in a box to me. The
opportunity will be a Bank boy, who
will have no luggage of his own & will
have the privilege of two seats so that
he may be loaded, beside he is very
friend & will be glad to oblige me
[unclear][/unclear] believe he will be leaving Dublin
on 4th day evening. James will tell
thee where to send them. My young ones are all
well - but oh! how near thou wert to coming to us
it frets me to think of it. Charlotte told me that
thou had even fixed on the week. I hope the youngs
things are finely with thee now. Sally desired me
to give thee her dear love. James & Sally have decided
against my economy, so if thou hast not bought
my silk please only to get me 6 yards, as cheap levantine
as thou can a jet, not a blue black & [deletion]2 1/2 yds[/deletion] 2 1/2 yards
of velvet which will make both bonnet & cape,
& the white lining fur. - I expect I shall not again
want a winter dress these many years - & they say
It is better to have it complete. In great haste
Thy affte [underline]LJF.[/underline]

remain two or three days -
Yours affectionately
in much haste

Dear Edwd & Sarah
Since this was written I find
I am to be the opportunity alluded to - I leave
this tomorrow morning & shall be set down at
this to[deletion]m[/deletion]morrow morning & shall be set down at
Latouche's Bank at nine o clock in the evening -
Perhaps Edwd may meet me - I shall probably
