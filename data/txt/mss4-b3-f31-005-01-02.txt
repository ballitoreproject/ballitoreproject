From Richard Shackleton to Anna Taverner



Ballitore 14th of 1st month 1783


+++ Be free, my dear Anna, in thy communications to us, and as frequent as free. The oftener we can hear from thee the more agreeable it will be to us  I wish us to live near that Spring which will nourish our amity, & render it pleasingly-profitable  that Spring which is the only effectual support to the tossed, tried distressed, and not otherwise comforted. This causes to be patient in tribulation, and to rejoice in hope of the continued merciful regard of the Almighty to us  For indeed what have we else to trust to, and to rely upon. If he cease to delight in us, if he withdraw his protection from us, vain are all our feeble efforts to help ourselves, and insipid would be the highest gratification in this life  And on the other hand, the feeling sense of his favour and approbation is sufficient to sweeten the bitterest cup.
        Through the kindness of Providence we are generally favoured with tolerable health  we are pleased to find that thou hast so well recruited  I supposed thou hast now thy friend Cousin Hannah Haughton with thee  I doubt not but her society will contribute much to cheer thy spirits. Ye seem to me to be as children of one Father, and I desire that your friendship may be sanctified, and thereby be made productive of Good to each of you. May you never lose a relish for the best things, but follow on to know the Lord through his various dispensations, till you become established in righteousness, and useful in your generation. The serviceable members of the Church are few, and these few are removing off the stage  Tis from the visited children in our religious [page number] 244 society that a succession is to be expected of Testimony bearers to that Truth which much stand for ever [sic].
