My dear friend

        Your remembrance of Thomas is kind, we have pleasing accounts both of him, and of Robert Milners abilities to discharge his trust respecting him; Thomas speaks of you & desired his love might be given to the families of both housesBallitore is the Criterion by which he judges all customs & manners; in his view every thing there is in so high perfection that not anything can rise superiour
        Thy Obliged Friend
