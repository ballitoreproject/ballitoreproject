Ballitore: 22/1 month 1787


Though I have had the pleasure of several personal interviews with my dear friend M.W. since I received a line from her, yet on perusing her last communications in writing I had a mind to take up the epistolary correspondence where it ended. Indeed it is a matter of humble gratitude to my mind that so many friends & of such quality are my near & dear intimates  and the desire of my heart is that I may not be foolishly elevated thereby, but be enabled to walk wisely before them (i.e. in their view) For certainly much depends, as to the general weal, on each visited & called & chosen individual coming up in their several places in the wisdom of Truth, in the excellency of dignity & of power  by this means we ^one^ becomes an help, & strength & encouragement to another, and an harmonious labour is witnessed for the propagation of the noblest cause, which ever was, can, or will be upon earth.

Affectionate sympathy with thee, & rooted, cordial respect for the deceased do not permit me to pass over in silence an even tin which thou art so feelingly interested, as the removal of thy dear sister K [?]  I have no particulars relative to the manner of her final close, but expect them from thy communicative friendship  I believe her life was honouralbe, & I doubt not but her death was Peace  I had a high opinion of her qualifications & endowments both natural & spiritual, notwithstanding my having very little opportunity of cultivating any personal acquaintance with her  & I am [page number] 124 persuaded that this dissolution of a temporary tie between two such sisters and friends must be a near pinch to thee  but thou art now well experienced in the nature of this world, thou knowest that though the cup of life be a cup of mixture, in which are some agreeable sensations, yet Trouble is the general predominant relish & savour  from this trouble, past, present & future, thy amiable, valuable sister is escaped, and landed safely I believe in the port of undisturbed felicity. An humble acquiescence with the divine will is therefore our duty (thou well knows [sic]) in such cases, & may it be attended with a lively aspiration after ability so to fill up our several lots, that when the solemn day of inquest shall come, we also may have to give up our accounts with joy.
