Waterford 20/11 month 1785
Dear Molly
At the desire of Peggy Rogers
I write a few lines to inform thee about Hannah Haughtons
Boxes as she was apprehensive thou might think
Pat had neglected following thy directions not hearing
from him since thou wrote - I am sorry to inform
thee the reason of his silence is indisposition - He has
been confined to the House since last Third-day & to
his bed there two days — he is in a very precarious way
he bleeds frequently at the nose & sleeps very little
complains of a great heaviness or weight in his head
Peggy tells me the Doctor does not know what opinion
to form of him yet — I have [unclear]not[/unclear] him to him to inquire
since I heard of Pat's illness which was only this day

Ansd. — 23 —

If any other person in Waterford would be directed to
forward thou things Peggy would wish to give them wk
but Hannah should be put to any inconvenience
for want of them — I shall inform thee if any alteration
should appear in Pats situation in a day or
two —
Give my love to all at home —
Thine affectionately
Tommy Strangman has seen the Doctor since &
informs me he has a very poor opinion of him
the symptoms are very alarming & he is apprehensive
of a putrid fever — which disorder
has a few days since taken off a young man
who was generally respected — He was an Apothecary
William Rayner
