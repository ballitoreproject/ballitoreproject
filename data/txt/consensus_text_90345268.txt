Had a letter from Polly to day, telling me
their party went off pretty well. There
were 16 Moyallen and Banbridge friends
reckoning [/unclear] themselves 21 in all, and spent
the evening playing game &c &c -
Papa, John, and Charlie came out
to dinner. but went with Mama to tea
at [unclear]Glendruid[/unclear]. War, war, war is now
the general topic of conversation, alas
that it should be such a sad one.
Sir Charles Napier commands the Baltic
Admiral Dundas the Black sea fleet,
I believe - and Lord Raglan the land
forces. I wonder how it will all end.
10th Papa spent to day with us &
very pleasant it was to have him, I
often wish we were with him more
when he [underline]is[/underline] out here - Now to day
for instance, I only saw him at
meal times. he went to town after tea.
Some how I do not think we are near
sociable enough among ourselves, perhaps
it is because I am so [underline]un[/underline]-sociable myself
