Ashtown: 16th of 8th month 1788.
My dear sister,
When I am at home I am quite easy about
writing to thee, because I hear [underline]of[/underline] thee through my father, – & I should
not like to add to thy perplexity, for I. know thou art hard set sometimes
to get settled time for writing much:– but now that I have
not this opportunity of hearing from thee, I feel myself uncomfortable
when long debar'd of that satisfaction, & being I know
a selfish creature, I een run the risk of causing [underline]thee[/underline] trouble
to gratify myself.– I received thine dated the 8th inst, which was
acceptable to my heart:– and as to this matter of going to thee, I
will just tell thee (as well as I can) my real sentiments about it,
& [underline]then[/underline] leave thee to thy liberty to do as thou thinks best:– as
to self, in the [underline]first place[/underline], – it would be a gratification to me to go,
I would rather (as to my own liking) go than not, I should love to
go:– but then, my mother I fancy (tho' I know not for certain) wou'd
[unclear]illegible[/unclear] have us at home in winter, & perhaps would be in [unclear][/unclear]
[unclear]illegible[/unclear] about this swelling in my neck; (which is not yet qui [unclear]illegible[/unclear]
removed,) but I do believe would not have much against [unclear]illegible[/unclear]
it, if thou wert desirous for it: – I mind thou says, "as yet that
"suffering time has not come very near me," – by which I understand
thou hast not taken thy [underline]shaking[/underline] fits of terrour yet;– now
if those do come on, & thy spirits sink, & thou feels lonesome, do
write to my father about [underline]me[/underline], & he & I will settle it with my
mother:– my dear [underline]prudent[/underline] brother Samuel need not fear (I hope)
my taking any thing unkind, that is not meant so; my dear love
to him, Anne Broadhead, E: Pim, & cousin Benjamin's kind house.
– Had Margt any fit taking the swine-pock? – the dear little creatures
I love them all,– was dreaming of honest Abram last night
I think.– Molly Hudson & I are left at present pretty much alone;
the man of the house being gone to his nephew's marriage,
to Edenderry; & the mistress gone to Dublin to prepare for the
reception of the bride:– we indeed to take a car & go tomorrow
to Ballycane, to be at the adjournment of their meeting of
discipline, tis 6 miles from hence I suppose – Second-day.
"grudge paying postage" for a letter from [underline]thee[/underline], – why I [underline]asure[/underline] thee
the pleasure it affords me to get a letter of thine [underline]in my hand[/underline], out
of the post-office, before I even read it, is worth more to me than
the postage, – so thou may see how reasonable it comes when I read
it– a while ago I got thy last, my beloved sister, I [unclear][/unclear] the 14th inst.
which

which I took kinder, & gratified me more, than I chuse to say:– but
I wonder my father;s giving thy letters the appellation he does, should
be any restraint on thee, because as cousin Saml. used to say, "it is all love"
for it is quite a feast to him to get them, & when they are long withheld.
it puts him quite out of sorts–Thy account of dear Anna is very
pleasing, & surprizing to me.–I hope thou hast got shut of the pain in
thy jaw. – About [underline]thee[/underline] I long & wish to hear tho', – thou tells me of others, but
not of thyself, do say something of how thou gets on; – I am so snug here, & no
creature having any thing to do, or expect, from [underline]my[/underline] getting letters. – Molly
Hudson & I set out yesterday for their monthly meeting, where I had some
tereble heart-beatings, betweens ourselves.– I know not my dear Peggy what
I am about, – I fear I have made sad mistakes, but thou hast found that
there is balm in Gilead, & a physician there, – so perhaps if I have done wrong
his gracious Physician may be pleased to heal me. – In old time I remark
that by burnt-offerings sins were forgiven, – & [underline]now[/underline] I expect sincere repentance
is in [underline]their[/underline] stead; – even for [underline]this[/underline], forgivenance was granted, "if a soul commit
a trespass, & sin thro' ignorance, in the holy things of the Lord;" – this has afforded
comfort to my mind:– last night I thought I felt this resigned state
& rejoiced to feel it – that I was content even to remain a while without
knowing that I was right, & that I would [underline]hope[/underline] that if I was wrong very
much, that I would be seized with much trouble & anguish of mind, – yet
I did, & do this morning, feel myself quiet & comfortable: – perhaps this
may too be a dangerous stake– I often think of a common saying among
some, perhaps improperly applied often,– "I am in dread of my [underline]life[/underline]." –
The friends of this house not yet returned.– Molly Hudson (who
has [underline]proved[/underline] my kind friend,) desires her love to thee:– thou hast mine
to a wonderful degree,– I think I never loved thee so well, & really
are somewhat ashamed to tell thee so:– but take it as it was meant &
believe me affectionately thine.
I know not whether thou wilt understand the above – I am hand set to speak what
