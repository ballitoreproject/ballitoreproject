After it we girls went out to the
"Park" to look at the gentlemen riding
and leaping - Mr Carrol joined them
so they mustered strong - It was
rather amusing certainly but not
very edifying - John had to leave
before our tea so Aunt E gave him
a cup before he started -
We spent a very quiet evening
Patrick went out to fish and
did not appear again that night
We worked copied music to which
Isabel and Richard entertained us in
the musical department.
2nd Tuesday - Isabel and I took
a walk to see a poor girl who is
in [deletion]comf[/deletion] consumption - It was melencholy
of sickness, but she was happy
and resigned or at least appeared to be
so - After dinner we started for
Marrow More wood. The boys [unclear]prophesed[/unclear]
rain and pretended to throw cold
water on the whole affair - but we
only laughed at their gloomy forebodings
in [unclear]xxx[/unclear] phaeton - On arrival at
to see her laid on the bed
and started off merrily
