From the same to the same

Ballitore: 13/10 month 1789

Dear friend
	+++ I hope there is likely to be among the youth a succession of testimony bearers, of valuable worthies, who perhaps will live & act better than some of us have done & will be favoured with a greater degree of life & power, & spiritual ability to promote & exalt the religion of Christ on the earth, in their generation. May we, who are yet alive in the body, be mercifully & graciously preserved alive in our spirits to the end, & having past [sic] through the various dispensations & probations which Infinite Wisdom may judge necessary for our purification & refinement & preparation for our staying a little longer acceptably, & finally departing in peace, may we (through everlasting kindness) find a place of uninterrupted rest at last! ++++
	Thine affectionately
		Richard Shackleton
