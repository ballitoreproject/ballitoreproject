Ballitore: 27/3 month 1777

Dear friend

	++ Thy intelligence was the first which my wife & I received concerning the deaths & burials which thou mentions. Happy no doubt is now the state of the two sisters, if religion had the uppermost room in their hearts while they were here. Its [sic] excellent virtue would have kept them clean & pure, & ready & prepared for such a sudden summons. They were personally strangers to me. The vileness, corruption & depravity of manners of the lowest rank of the people I think is remarkable, that examples of capital punishment & the solemnities of the apparatus of death & of funerals, do not deter many of them from wickedness & profligacy, nor inspire them with serious thoughts. Good examples among their superiours I believe would have more beneficial effects than dread of punishment. My mind is at times much concerned in the poor, low order of my countrymen & fellow-creatures, formed by the same great hand which made us who are a little more elevated in degree, & designed for like noble purposes with ourselves ++++
	Thine affectionately
		Richard Shackleton
