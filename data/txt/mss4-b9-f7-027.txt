My dear Elizabeth
We are in great trouble just
now, but I think we shall be enabled
to bear up against A. I fear greatly
for Sarah, as she is at present situated
but we must only do our best and
leave the rest to God. Our first born
is I have no doubt her Death bed
& earnestly pray she may not suffer
[unclear]much[/unclear]. It is hard to hear her innocent
talk even now as she lies
so deeply deeply oppressed with that
slow and too sure disease, Alas Alas,
but there is no help --- except from
Above.
I got your remittance from H Allen
I just got your remittance from JC Allen
Please to tell RSL he may have the
least yours affectionatey
