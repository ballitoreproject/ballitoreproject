My dearest friend
How humiliating a condition
do i place myself in, in [underline]thus[/underline] trying
to obtain some information respecting my
Hearts Idol, Alas will he not deign in
two words to calm my agonized soul
say, say, but you live, & are happy, & I will
with the last throb, bless thy goodness, Alas
if you were placed in my situation, how different
would my behaviour [underline]be[/underline] towards you, if I
could not love, I would at least pity, not
despise, surely it was no fault of mine,
to love, what a Child I was when first
I saw you, with an innocence equal to my
years I discovered to you the fatal secret
could the memory be expunged by [insertion]my[/insertion] tears
long, long ago should remembrance been
erased from my Heart, Ah think me not

too presuming if I again solicit the favour
of a few lines. to say you are still among
the living, send one line of cosolation to
One, who has drank deeply of the cup of
sorrow, by the ill fated attachment that
has deprived of all happiness your Eliza
Given how I shudder to think of the risk
 I run in daring under my present state to
address you, I dare not sign my name
to this hasty Epistle but you need it
not, well do you [insertion]know[/insertion] the former Name of her
who now entreats this favour, grant this
once, I live but for you to seal my pardon
let me plead in vain, Oh my beloved
Angel! if there was a love more pure,
sweeter or innocent than what I feel for
you I should not wonder at [underline]my[/underline] fate,
I must resign myself to grief, sorrow, despair

without one gleam of hope, one soothing
word to smooth the path of desparing love.
My dearest Sir, (I dare not call you by a tenderer
appellation) I again implore you [unclear]favour[/unclear]
me by getting your likeness taken I will have
it set in gold & Pearl, it is enough for me
to say, that it would be the greatest treasure
I could possess, if I thought you would value
mine how soon you could have have it from
me, if I receive yours I will try to think
 mine would not be altogether unworthy of
your acceptance, once more if Soft Pity ever
warmed that bosom, shew it to [underline]me[/underline] & if
we are doomed never more to meet in this
world, o grant [insertion]me[/insertion] the consolation of dying with the
precious gift [unclear][/unclear] my Heart. Farewell my sweet
Beloved, every blessing [underline]rest[/underline] upon [underline]you[/underline]
