Ballybarney 10th Jany. 1818
Dear Cousn
Mary Leadbeater
I arrived here yesterday &
was also at this place abt. three Months ago
& shd have been glad of ye Oppn of paying a
visit to Ballitore; had not ye different unpleasant
circumstances render'd it more prudent
to stay in Dublin till my business was done &
then return home — I have frequently been
consernd abt thee & all my Relations in this
Country; & I wish I had reason to believe things
were quite settled & pleasant again. — however
I shall be glad to have a Line whilst have
addressed to me at P. Crawford [unclear]Booked[/unclear] Dublin
and I hope will bring an acct of yours having not
[double transcription]
been materially injured — & that a good share of [insertion]you are favd to enjoy[/insertion]
Health — my family was well when I left home
wch was abt two weeks ago, having been in Scotland
& thro part of ye North of this Country; has
landed at Bangor - after having a very Stormy Passage
— I think I shall begin to tire of Crossing
ye Sea — & wish I could transact my business
advantageously without coming so often — I have
5 of my Childrn at home; my Eldest is retd from Tottenham
where she was at School ye last year —
It will be very satisfactory to me to hear of thee
shall hope thou wilt not fail to write in of Post

or two, as may not stay hear longer than abt
a Week — say how thy Sister Lydia has bore
ye hurry of ye Times & how thy Mother is.
I get much tossed abt was not long ago in
London — see our relation there who told me
see thy Sister when there - my Sister Sarah
who was extremely Ill when cousin Sarah was
at Sheffd. has recovered tho at times very poorly
& was much dissapointed she did not see
her — I left her at my House when I left
home (on her way to ye Quartlerly meet at
York -) where she wd stay abt a Week.
I was sorry I had to leave home without
getting much of her Company; as my going
by Scotland obligd me to leave home rather
sooner — say how they are at Athy whether
they have sufferd much in their property
& whether Frds have been much tried.
but how soon a change may come to us
is somewhat uncertain -
Remember my kind Love to
all thy relations with whom I may have
knowledge & accept a share thereof from
Thy Affect cousn J. Carbutt.
We keep very quiet in our country,

Say what number of Children thou hast
& if they are well. I did not forget you
when I was here, altho I did not write;

Mary Leadbetter
Ballitore.
