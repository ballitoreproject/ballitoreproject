her, which he did, afterwards
going on to Glendruid where he
dined, and we called as usual.
It was pouring rain coming
out of meeting, so we gave Mary
Gough a seat. After dinner
Avy Liddy and went to Sidney
Herbert's, and after tea we took a
stroll down the avenue with Papa
3rd. Papa went to town, Joshua Fayle
made his appearance just as we
had finished tea
4th.. The day turning out pretty fine
we thought a drive to the Glen of the
Downs would be pleasant, so Avy
drove us, and as we brought a snack
with us, it was quite a little picnic,
there were only the four of us.
after dinner Joshua left us as he
intended walking on to Wicklow where
his brother is. We drove home and
were back before five. I believe Papa
and Margt went down to Colemanstown
