Uncle and Aunt, Mary
White and Wilhelmina
Downes when in the
covered car to see the
Duke's castle. while we
young people staid at
home and amused
ourselves - T H White
set his musical box
going, so we began
to dance - and Doctor
Patten came in and
joined us for awhile.
Then I played a
game of chess, with
T H White, and he won
and afterwards a second
which I won -
We came back here
to the old place after tea.
