Kilcaven 3mo=5th 1796
Dear William
I find (by thy last letter) the opinion
thou harbours of me, I cant say any thing as to vindicate
my own cause be He that knows the secrets of all
hearts knows my mind and intentions whether they
be good or evil and if thou be favoured with a better
understanding of things, I think if I gave way to
to the adversary of Mankind thou ought rather to
pity me and adise me than upbraid me for my fault
perhaps thou had no Idea of the sorrow and affliction
I was in at the time I wrote to thee, and whether thou
believes it or not I've been indeavouring this long time
to have something to the fore that I would not be
troubling thee for I would not trouble thee if I
could by any means help it, thou knows in a measure
my situation, and deal with me according
to thy intentions and thats all I requre I have no
Mare now and I'd be glad to know if I could
get the blind Mare to help me with my spring
business please to give my love to my sister and
I remain (if I may be allow'd the expression) thy
Brother Jno. Leadbeater
