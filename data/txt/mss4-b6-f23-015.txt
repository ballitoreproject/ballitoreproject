May I presume my tale to bring
To him whom Truth has taught to sing
The moral bard whose living lay
[unclear][/unclear] the step to Virtue's way
What tho' on that benignant [insertion]respected [/insertion] hero
The brighter wreaths of genius glow
That pitying brow is kindly bent
On paths tho' ill perform'd well meant
Yet Crabbe's high name in such a song
Invoked, that honour'd name may wrong
Dolon in [deletion]frugal [/deletion]humble plenty blest
The comforts of his lot confest
Those fields the harvests robes array'd
Thro' these [deletion]the[/deletion] [insertion]his[/insertion] well fed cattle strayd
His art his trial the fleece [deletion]to[/deletion] [insertion]trans[/insertion]form
Into the garment fair and warm
Thus honest gains appear'd around
But one superior blessing crown'd
All other gifts - a virtuous wife
Frugal industrious graced his life
While thus the medal fair was eyed
who thought upon the other side
Tis turn'd behold a sad reverse
That draught of Irelands land the curse
Inflaming Whiskey Dolon lov'd
Its dire effects full oft he prov'd
The gains of many a [unclear]tedious[/unclear] day
Swept in a few short hours away
Repentance comes with heavy tread
And [unclear]thickeng[/unclear] clouds hang o'er his head
And many an earnest vow is made
Thus never more to be betray'd
Temperance & toil return again
The lighten'd heart forgets its pain
Alas another fatal day
Arrives appear the comrades gay
"Shall Patrick's morn unnoticed [insertion]honored[/insertion] pass
Come Dolon take the social glass"
He goes resolved his steady soul
Shall brave the dangers of the bowl
Tempt not thy strength temptation nigh
Dolon tis wise, tis brave to fly
This shalt thou own & shalt deplore
When the last mispent day is o'er

Alas more frequent now is quaff'd
Urged by despair the desperate draught
Alas for now the desart drear
And [deletion]searching[/deletion] [insertion]the due[/insertion] blast of want is near
He feels beneath the searching ray
His Independence [deletion]melt[/deletion] [insertion]fade[/insertion] away
A wily neighbour's anxious care
Watch'd Dolon & his pastures fair
And spread for him the secret snare
Those wants his ready purse supplied
Which Dolon from the world would hide
This aid high interest must demand
Till paid by Dolon's toiling hand
And goods beneath their value paid
That dearly brought insidious aid
[deletion][/deletion]
Still Dolon to the treacherous bowl
Flies to relieve his tortured soul
The treacherous bowl & treacherous friend
[deletion]Combi[/deletion] Alike to Dolon's ruin tend
The Landlord now his right demand
And seizes Dolon's forfeit lands
The neighbour comes, the land redeems
Why is he not the friend he seems
Why does not generous pity plead
And prompt the neighbours kindly deed
Ah no he sees the tempest dread
Bursting on that devoted head
And [insertion]only[/insertion] sees [deletion]above[/deletion] his destined prey
Midst scenes of anguish & dismay
For other debts a pauper's throng
The tide of ruin roll along
For now [deletion]within[/deletion][insertion] in[/insertion] a prison's dreary bound
The wretched Dolon now is found
While the dire waste of former days
conscience with keen reproach display
While thro' his self of accusing heart
Tortures succeeding tortues dart
Yet one was here his grief to share
And calm the struggles of despair
'Twas she whose ceaseless cares were tried
Vainly to stem misfortune's tide
Tis true with many a piercing groan
She left the mansion once her own
While her six babes amend her throng
And one unborn she bears along
