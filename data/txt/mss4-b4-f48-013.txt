My dear Betsy,
I could not till yesterday have answered your letter, [deletion][/deletion] because Judy
Lennon went to Dublin two or three days before I received it, as it was not till
yesterday her mother heard that she was with the person for whom she nursed,
whether to remain there or not, she did not know. However she fears that there
might be a disappointment, as Judy is rather uncertain, the distance so great, & I
fear she might not be equal to do the allotted work, so as to give satisfaction. I hope
Judy is an honest woman, she had very good principles & sentiments when she lived
with me, why she left me I forget. It is the want of education, & bad examples in
consequence, perpetuation from generation to generation, which has [deletion]branded[/deletion] caused an
from country folk to be branded with the name of dishonesty, not the religion they
poor country folk to be branded with the name of dishonesty, not the religion they
profess, which thou knows nurse is very strict in observing [insertion]& us trust in honesty I believe[/insertion]. If the upper ranks in
Co. Tepperary would exert themselves to forward the work of education, if they would encourage
courage the poor to help themselves, to establish saving Banks, & such things, & not
consider them as "creatures of another kind," they would feel the benefits themselves, as
well as those who would look up to them with reverence & love, for grateful heart I am
sure they have, though the genualery is the contrary. [unclear]M & A &[/unclear] I would not venture to recommend
any one, considering the difficulty of knowing the real character, the distance
commend any one, considering the difficulty of knowing the real character, the distance
& the responsibility we should incur
I am glad to hear my dear sister is so much better, long may she be spared to her
family & friends. I doubt not but you are very comfortable together for
"Through all nature like its likeness loves."
I think it is a great privilege to any pen day to have thy company. & I beseech of thee

to impress upon him the duty he owes to his master & the satisfaction he will feel in strict
attention to his desires which are for his good, & that he will by no means seek any company
which he does not approve. Let him be assiduous & attentive to his business, fulfil
his engagement faithfully, enjoy the company of his cousin, & be thankful to his kind
aunt who is so friendly to him, & he will with a double relish taste of more enlarged though
safe so society at home. My dearest love is to him I am much obliged to him for his letter. I
rejoice that he endeavours to improve his mind. I want thee to mention Tom Hally. Surely
thou art not so changed but that thou would speak to this poor but extraordinary man
If thou could get some sketches of his life from him for my Biography it would much
oblige me. And I have a message for his wife which thy humanity will prompt thee
to deliver to her. the poor woman suffers dreadfully in lying in & a poultice of [deletion]Laud[/deletion] [insertion]Laurel[/insertion]
leaves fired in Hogs lard topped is a piece of flannel, applied [insertion]not[/insertion] to the navel & left on
till she is quite safe has been of great use. The poem I [insertion]got it from[/insertion] recommended as the practice
of a Paris physician. Will thou impress this upon her memory. Ah our dear, young
princess, what [deletion]a[/deletion][insertion]a[/insertion] distressing event is her death! I do not like to think of it, & our
lovely, pleasant Kitty Smith! And so many of our neighbours since thou left us
just now I saw poor Mary Tooles' coffin carried in. The fever has been In six months
in that house they say, & I believe Mary went as her sister Kitty Maxwell did
[deletion]which[/deletion] [insertion]while[/insertion] infection kept us aloof, yet I hope she was not neglected. We were much
concerned to hear of [unclear]OGrubbs'[/unclear] [deletion]little [/deletion] robbery. Thy father is gone on a little exceursion
I believ to Hull &c. My mother was at meeting to day, & sends her dear love to thee, as do [deletion]well[/deletion] we all.
& thy aunt Sally adds hers to Thos. Jackson, & request thou wilt remind him that when she had
the pleasure of his company in Waterford he mentions a composition to keep [unclear]states[/unclear] on
house, & we all unite with her in requesting the receipt. Do write a note to him & get it
for us. Aunt Sally also begs if it is his in thy way to remind Jas. Abell that she suggested
to him, applying to rich Joseph Pike on behalf of poor Abby Widdons, who is a distant [unclear]station[/unclear]
Indeed I am grieved to see Abby so low in the world, In I respect & regard her. And really I

would like well to be rich on many accounts. But if I ought to be so I suppose I should, we
have each our station in society to keep within it is the art of living comfortably. Ed. Carroll
& his handsome, genteel agreeable wife spent one day in Ballitore. They gave us a call
I have entered into my sixtieth year. My eyes are failing, my memory, & the frequent mistakes
I have made shew is a general failure. However I never can write a letter in company with
comfort. Sister Chandlee seems tolerably well. I suppose Jane & her pretty, little charge will soon go
to town as Debby is near her time. Deborah [unclear]findy[/unclear] Ebenr. following plans of benevolence with
energy of perseverance. The adult school, held on first days, is getting on well I hope, & old fellows
learn to read. Our [unclear]orphan[/unclear] girl promises well. She says Kitty Robinson grieved for her brother. Could
not such a thing by done at Clogheen as [insertion]having an Adult school[/insertion], I believe the society for promoting education would give
assistance, & it would be a beginning. Did thou hear that Tommy Doyle & Jane Williams had
sent on their resignation & that Larry Doyle is accomplishing himself at the Model School. Betty
Doyle to be mistress. Poor Mary Toole's funeral is just gone out. I have not often heard more lament.

Davis has had an alarming account of his brother Samuel. Hugh Thompson called here a while
ago with Anne Coddington, she enquired afftely for thee. Be sure our dear love to thy aunt &
cousins from us all.
Mary is here & thou would laugh to see her & her uncle W. L. vis a vis
with their faces near each other, praising one another's beauty
My dear cousin my mother resigns the pen to a far less able
though I hope & think as an affectionate a hand. I suppose
[insertion]thou[/insertion] knows I have been a long time in Dublin & am not long
returned from it. I need not say how rejoiced I should
be to get a letter from thee when thou should feel a wish
to gratify me. there is no way thou could do it sooner now
than by writing, my dearest love to Richard, I wish, he would
ever thy M Leadbeater

write also. I suppose my mother has related all the news
There is now no fear of the Measles, & Hannah improves much
