In a committee supposed to be struck on account of want of love in the year 1782 Richard Shackleton expressed himself thus, And a child shall lead them. He repeated it several times in an affecting manner - and - The lion and the lamb shall lie down together - Be children in malice, & men in understanding - I scorn that thing of tattling or tale-bearing - my soul has been troubled within me, and I have travailed in the deeps about these things,could lay myself under your feet to be trampled on by you, if it would but preserve you. I am full of weakness, but, my friends, I am very honest.
