a while met the bridegroom elect -
I could not stay long with Debbie
so saw but little of her - Came
out with Papa by 5Â½ train and met
Georgina at the station - I had called
on her this morning and asked [insertion]her[/insertion] to
come spend a few days with us -
It is very pleasant to have her here here,
and like old times.
25 Saturday - Georgina took a ride
after dinner - She and I bathed
also - and on enquiring about
Georgina's artificial flowers which
she had lost off her bonnet, I put
in a word for my poor little
buckle - and found that one [underline]had[/underline]
been found - and it turned out to
be mine most fortunately -
26 Sunday - Georgina Ned and
I went to meeting on the car -
Uncle A returned with us -
The mare fell - Gabe Fisher
dined here too -
