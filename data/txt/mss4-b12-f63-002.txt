On seeing your Bror yesterday I presume
you are in town, therefore beg leave to trouble
you with this. I know I break a little thr[unclear][/unclear]
rule but hope to be excused as I think it
a necessary matter of form -
From the receptn. I met with
from yr mother on my last visit to see you
I cant think of seeking farther for a Union
between us without the approbatn. of my
friends as 'twas evident the whole proceedings
were contrary to their desire; And another
thing, where there's such a disparity in -
Curcumces as it appears theres between us
that side wch. has the advantage generally
looks with indifference on the other & certain[insertion]ly[/insertion]
'tis contrary to reason (as yr. mother remarked)
to think that People who are well experienced
in the world would approve of it, I am under
many obligatns. for the great preference you
made me, & if you'll please to accept a
release for all promises I am satisfied
(tho' agst. my wish) at any time to acknow[insertion]ledge[/insertion]
it

Yr. Mother also seemed to be uneasy
that yr. Ltres should lie in my hands. I therefore
send you all of them that rems. with me
Yr. 1st I lost & the two last I burned, rest
assured they were & wd. be as safe [deletion]with[/deletion] in
my hands as in your own for never
will I leave it in anyone's power to
charge me with an improper action,
Pray accept my best wishes for your
happiness, I am under such promises
to your mother, as, that I cant expect
to hear from you with[insertion]out[/insertion] the Concurrence
of the family, must conclude with
only sig[insertion]n[/insertion]ing myself [deletion]for your[/deletion]
your very humble servt
