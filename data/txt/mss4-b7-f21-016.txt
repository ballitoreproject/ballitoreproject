Monk Coniston July 19th - 1807
I cannot allow my Man of War to enter
your Kingdom again, my dear Mary, without a line (tho' it
must be a hasty one) to thank you for your friendly letter, &
the dear little Girls for their present, - indeed their works do
infinite credit both to themselves & their Instructress -.
pray tell them I very much admire their nice Samplers,
& I believe Turpin is satisfied that they are unique!
Mr. S. being offer'd a Troop in the 4th. Dragoon Guards without
purchase, of course joyfully accepted it,- as these are times
in which every Military Man must feel himself bound
to come forward; & it is much more desirable to be in an old
regular Corps, than in a new undisciplined one - He sets off
for Ireland to morrow, & expects to find the Regt. at Belturbet -
[unclear]It[/unclear] was always obvious to me that no Peace made with the
[unclear]C[/unclear]orsican could be durable,- & [underline]now[/underline] I think the point at issue is

Shall we exist as a Nation of Freemen, or become the Slaves
of an Ambitious Tyrant? - Shall we exist as an Independent
Nation, or become a Province of France? - I wish my dear
Friend that your Countrymen may feel as I do on the present
occasion; but I [underline]doubt[/underline] them, & therefore wish that S. had not
been forced amongst them - I will send your letter soon
to our good Thomas, for it will delight him,- at present
I have no time for any thing, & both my head & heart are
all confusion - so that vile as this scrawl is, you must
esteem it no small proof of my Esteem that I take up
my pen at all - We are all vastly obliged to you
for your goodness to Brian, & hope he will - through your
kind exertions - become a worthy member of Society; God will
I am persuaded, bless ye all, for the Mercy ye shew to others!
Ballitore, is the best School I know, in which to study
Charity - If S. is ever near you, he will have the
pleasure of seeing you - I can scarcely ever expect to do
so, but I shall never cease to be very Sincerely Yrs. [unclear]JS[/unclear]

Remember us most kindly to all our Friends - [unclear][/unclear]
[unclear]duly[/unclear]
