Dear Sarah
I snatch a few spare
moments to tell thee how much gratified
I was at receiving thy note. I
cannot easily express the pleasure I
felt at thy account of thy sister Lydia's
improvement. I heartily rejoiced at,
it. I am longing to see her & all
of you; if I can accomplish it with
out missing any lectures, I shall go
at Christmas with Joseph Humphrey
& Austen. - I am glad to hear of
thy being [underline]enchanted[/underline] with Byson, he
is indeed as thou says an admirable
poet: but I do not admire him
most in his minor poems, (the serious, curious
Paranoia etc.) Childe Harold is my
favourite especially the two last cantos.

We see in him none of that delight in
war, & the barbarous [deletion]dad[/deletion] deeds of warriors,
so conspicuous in the writings of
the majority of that tribe. All I wish
for Byron is that he may become a
[underline]religious[/underline] character, & then his writings
must do good. His deep knowledge
of the human heart, its tenderest feelings
& most depraved passions, would
make him a very powerful Christian
writer, if he [underline]were[/underline] a Christian. However,
his writings, as they are, may do
good, & I prefer them I think, to
those of any other living poets, Shall
we ever see another Cowper? I have
run on too far with this rhapsody,
or whatever it is, however thou wilt
perceive by this that I do not look
upon his poems as [underline]"food that is not[/underline]
[underline]convenient"[/underline]
What a melancholy event [unclear]was the[/unclear]
death of Sir Samuel Romilly! [unclear]The[/unclear]
On hearing it, many of my hopes were
blasted as I thought, but it is not
easy, indeed it is impossible to fathom
the designs of Providence - our only
consolation is - that the affairs of the
world are in His hands, & that as
he raised Him up, he may also
raise up others to become the champions
of his glorious cause. Buxton
is a member, & will be a useful
one, I should think, but I must
bid thee farewell, I have written out
my time.
Thine affectionately
Thomas Fisher
J. H. - & E. A. desire to be remembered
to Lydia.
