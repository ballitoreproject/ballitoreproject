My dear Elizabeth
Sarah could be oblig'd
to you to send by the first convenient
opportunity, the Insurance Policy to which
the Noteee Rich'd sent her retates very
that by which the Iron Concerns are
insured with the Hibernian Insurance
be - I am sorry to hear of your
suffering so much from the toothache
which this dull damp weather has [deletion]I think[/deletion]
a great tendency to prolong. Depressed
spirits [insertion]are[/insertion] often accompanied by this teazing
pain. I hope such is not the cause of
yours. Even to this however cheerfulness
is an antidote, but what great strength
does it not oftentimes require before we
can employ it. The children are still
laboring under [underline] the cough, [/underline] Willie the worst.
Magt gains strength but slowly I remain
yours affectionately
