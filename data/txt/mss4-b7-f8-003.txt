Dialogue 8th. th. Diogenes & Pollux.
D. I charge thee Pollux /for it is thy
turn to live tomorrow) as soon as thou
turn to live tomorrow/ as soon as thou
ascendest when thou seest that Cynic
Menippus /but thou wilt find him at
Corinth about the Craneum or in Lyceum,
laughing at the philosophers quarreling
one with another/ to tell him that -
"Diogenes charged thee Menippus if
"thou hast laughed sufficiently at the
"things which are on earth to come hither
"to laugh much more for there thou laugh[unclear]ed[/unclear]
doubtfully & that frequent. For who
[unclear][/unclear]y knows what things are after
[unclear][/unclear]. But here thou shalt not cease to
"laugh stoutly as I do now: And chiefly
"when thou seest richmen, & peers, & tyrants
"so humble & obscure known by
"the wailing alone & that they are soft
"& degenerate remembering their earthly
"affairs" - Tell him these things & besides
to come with [insertion]a[/insertion] bag full of lupines & if perchance
he finds He He[insertion]r[/insertion]cates supper lying in a place
where th[insertion]r[/insertion]ee ways meet on an egg after purification
or any such thing. P. I will
tell these things Diogenes but what sort

of a man is he to whom I am to go that I may
know him well. D. An old bald man wearing a
ragged thread-bare coat having a passage
for every breeze streaked with the pieces of ragged
garments. But he is always laughing
& for the most part taunts those arrogant
philosophers. P. Come it will be easy to find
him from these marks. D. Wilt thou let
me tell thee any thing for these philosophers
P. Speak for this is not troublesome. D.
Chiefly exhort them, to leave off trifling & contending
about the universe & making sophisms
& syllogisms & teaching the mind to ask
such unuseful things. P. But they will
tell me reprehending their wisdom that I
am unlearned. D. But thou [insertion]tell[/insertion] them that from
me. P. I will tell these Diogenes. D. But
tell the rich men dear little Pollux these
"Why do ye guard your gold, vain men
"but why do ye torment yourselves counting
"your usury & he heaping talents upon talents
who have need when you come here
"only a 'h penny." B. I will tell them. D
And tell to the strong & pretty, both
Negillus the Corinthian & Damoxenus
the wrestler that we have neither
yellow hair nor joyfull of or black
eyes or is there redness in our faces
or our nerves strong or shoulders
robust but all we have is dust
they say, our skulls bare of beauty. P.
Nor is it troubles to me to tell the beautiful
& strong. D. And tell, [underline]Lacedemonian[/underline] [insertion]Pollux[/insertion],
to the poor [insertion]for[/insertion] there are many & very poor
bewailing their want neither to cry nor
bewail putting before them the equality
thats here that the shall see them that are
rich there not better than themselves And
If it pleases thy Lacedemonians from
me that they are strengthened. P. say
not a word of the Lacedemonians Diogenes
for I will not bear it but I will
tell what thou hast charged to the
rest. D. Let us [insertion]let[/insertion] them alone seeing
thou hast a mind But thou bring
the words from me to whom I told
thee. -

Dear Molly
I received thy letter making
a display of small forces but I
perceive a wile I fear I have made
a great display of my forces more

great body of Allies from the neighbouring
counties.
