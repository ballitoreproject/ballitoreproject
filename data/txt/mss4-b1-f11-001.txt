A Vision I saw the 18th day at Night of 12 mo. 1684
As I was asleep in bed at Welchpool in Mountgomeryshire in
Wales I was under a great exercise in my sleep & much waited
in my Spirit (I thought I beheld an Angel standing before me
crying with a terrible Voice Lightness & A[insertion]i[/insertion]riness is carried away
with the wind at which Voice (I thought) I fell on my Face to the
Ground when I lay for some time under a great Dread then I
thought I fastened my hand upon my breast & said O Lord if thou
kill me let me keep hold of thy truth, for it hath never failed
me in any exercise. but hath always been sufficient for me & hath
Ministered true content in every exercise so I felt the life of [deletion][/deletion]
truth raised up in my Soul & it gave me Strength to rise & stand
before the Angel & also courage to Speak & I said do these sayings,
belong to me, & is it a warning of some trial thats coming
upon my self, then I was answered it had a general Signification
in it - And then I awoke out of my Sleep. I still remained under,
great weight & Dread concidering the Exercise that I had been in
then I did retire [insertion]in[/insertion] my mind unto the Lord in true Stillness &
Quietness & then I felt the life of truth so spring in my heart. & I was
sweetly born up under the Exercise, & a great Mountain was shew'd
unto me & I was taken in spirit & set upon the top of the Mountain
& then I beheld a pleasing Valey & a few People in the Valey with
whome I had a great Desire to be with but was not able because of
the Steepness of the mountain; then I Earnestly desired of the Lord
to be down & the great Mountain bowed of its own accord & set me
Down in the Valley where we are all in peace together & then reared
it self to the same height again, & I looked & beheld a multitude
of People that were set upon the top of the Mountain whose desire
was to be down & was not able for whome I was greatly concerned
& they stood still looking stedfastly to us & the Mountain bowed of its
own accord & set them down with us in the Valey, & then the Mountain

Rear'd itself to the same height again, & I beheld a little Stile of the
other side of us, that was disturbed at the Mountain because of setting
us down in the Valey and it began to tremble at the Mountain I looked
& beheld the foundation of the great Mountain shaken & it tumbled
down over the Stile & over all our heads & the tumbled & Dashed one
against another, & the Valey on which we stood was not moved, nor
one of us Hurt that was there, & the dashed so long long untill all became
an Even Plain the Valey on which we stood was Exalted & we were in
peace together, magnifiing the Lord, for his great Deliverance & the
word of the Lord run throug[insertion]h[/insertion] my Soul thus shall the Potsheards
of the Earth be dashed together.
