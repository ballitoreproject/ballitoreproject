My dear friends,
my last was a poor return for thy impressive epithalamium
on Reperusal & sharing it to our friend Dr. Maharg we concluded it deserved a
better fate than puting it under the cushion, in consequence he copied
it neatly - and to wch. we annexed the following lines -
Madam
The celebrity of you name, and your munificence have
long since reached this land, whose generous sons & daughters, hail
your late (we hope) happy union with one of our favoured country
men - A bard of Erin presumes to present you wth. an Epithalamium
on the auspicious event - accompanied wth a picture of the present
[deletion]of many of its[/deletion] [insertion]state of many of its[/insertion] miserable inhabitants.
The committee who have signed the printed paper were
directed to forward copies to such in this and your Kingdom, on whom
they had even a distant claim, and many have generously contributed,
our present fund amounts to between 4 & 500 and wch. we
fear will be exhausted long before the most pressing season commences.
The plan of distributing the bounty is by small weekly portions
of oatmeal to such as are in urgent want, and by suppling
[unclear]others[/unclear] with flax to spin, for wch purpose spinning wheels are much
We trust Madam you will pardon our [unclear]inter[/unclear]
soliciting your aid towards this good work, wch. will be [unclear]fully[/unclear]
received either by our secretary Thos Haughton (Carlow) or
by John Pim London, in the latter case you will please
to drop a line to T:H
signed on behalf of the committee
T:H
I forwarded the above headed by the poem & one of unprinted circulars
to John Pim London - requesting him to have them
printed & forwarded - & have [underline]some[/underline] hopes of lightening the burden
of this vast business - Thy directions respecting the Author
have been complied wth as near as possible, the poem was not produced
to the committee nor any [insertion]conversation on the subject[/insertion] [deletion]mention of it[/deletion] latterly - we [unclear]acted[/unclear]
as above quite privately - (we wish hear the latest acct you had
of your near relative A: Tayler - I dread the consequence of such attacks
when Ulcers are once formed in the lungs the patient seldom

(if ever) recovers - Our James seems to have nearly thrown off his
complaint & several others of us who had colds are better. This
has been & still continues a very inauspicious season both
for valatudinarians - and for geting in the crops - however
we must hope for the best - a few days fine weather at this
season wou'd [deletion]woud[/deletion] completely dry up the ground - yet there appears
cause of much alarm on acct of the [insertion]backwardness of the [/insertion] oat sowing wch. will retard the
other sowings (I fear) too late
Thy affecte friend
