kind Wishes to them all, I hope you have allowd Molly to attend
[deletion][/deletion] [insertion]ye[/insertion] ascension of Mr. Crosbie in his balloon, I'm sure
she will be charmd with it, & think with me, its of all others
the most grand & sublime of views, the people here seem to
be sick of it, the have got frightend, at the sad disaster of the
French men. & to make use of a [underline]ball[/underline], they don't like landing
in the [underline]sea[/underline], "that the dont indeed; a pipe & strong beer, is all
their ambition; I scarcely think the greater part of them, one
single degree removed from the brute creation; I am quite out
of humour with them, & long much to get to old Ireland again
does Mr. Burke live near here; or coud he assist in our [unclear]India[/unclear]
business; I dont think it woud be amiss to inform [insertion]him[/insertion] of it; if you
can give me an introduction to him; Ill thank [insertion]you[/insertion]; & you may
rely I shant make a bad use of it; I shall expect to hear from
