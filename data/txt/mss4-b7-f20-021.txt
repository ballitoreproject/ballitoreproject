Dear Mrs Leadbeater
Both I and my daughter have read the Poem
that you sent to us. It has many excellent lines and I was much interested
in it. You have touched a very [deletion][/deletion] difficult subject with a delicate
hand. I fear much from what Sr John Newport says that the Typhus
still rages in Ireland. I believe that he particularly speaks of the Neighborhood
of Waterford and Cork, at least there he resides. The people cannot be
persuaded to guard sufficiently against infection
I read with very great pleasure your account of the Finns and that Owens
literature is worth twenty pounds a year
You will see by the paper that Mrs Fry and Mr. Gurney have
in the course of a northern tour been visiting all the
Prisons, and Mr Gurney has published a very interesting
and valuable account of the state in which they
found those melancholy abodes - I hope by the efforts
of these good People and of others who also greatly
enter into this important subject that much good will be
done. Now that Mr Smith is again returned to London
he will I am sure enquire concerning Mr Shackletons [unclear]inocation[/unclear],
and should there be anything to communicate you may depend upon
hearing - You have no doubt heard that Mr Clarkson attended
the Congress at Aix la Chapelle, hoping to find an opportunity of
forwarding that great and good cause the abolition of the slave trade,
the narration of what passed I hope soon to forward to you for your
perusal, you are at liberty to take a copy when I shall be obliged to you
to return it to me again - I am dear Mrs Leadbeater yours very sincerely
Frances Smith
