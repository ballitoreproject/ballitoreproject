The detail of my dear Mary's satisfactions I can assure
her contributed not a little to mine, particularly as I had
been uneasy on her account, not receiving any [deletion]account[/deletion] [insertion]Letter[/insertion] from
Ballitore where I imagined a few lines I wrote would
meet thee, & having in my sleep two nights successively
beheld thee deprived of life. There was no Sybil
to have recourse to who might have interpreted my
dream & no one to inform me that on the Northern
Hills Arcadia was restored. Such allurements are
not to be met with in every region so I shall not
be much surprised to find thou mayst have taken
up thy abode in such an enchanted country when
I shall shake off the log which retards my progress
to see thee. I find I must give up all thoughts of enjoying
the happiness of spending a few days with
you in Ballitore while I continue in my present
employment as I never asked for the indulgence but
when it might have been granted without the least
inconvenience I had not the satisfaction to succeed.

& cannot bear exposing myself often to repulses
The fragment of the Mirrour which thou hast conveyed me
reflects so exactly our infantile amusement that it seems
as if purposely designed to represent the [unclear]Hound[/unclear] & little
spots contiguous where we have spent so many happy
minutes - (I never saw that Piece) It is always very
pleasing to me to hear of my Old Ballitore acquaintances
Please remember me affectionately to all who may fall in
thy way. - Thomas Fayle sets off to conclude his
affair with Mary Boardman immediately - I suppose
they will come home next week - A few days since
arrived here John Pim with John & Sally Grubb & Johnny
told me my Uncle expected to go home soon Does
his arrival put an end to thy agreeable visit! If not
may I hope for another letter from Elysium - It gave
me a considerable share of concern to hear of the
later melancholy events which happened in our native
village what a vast alteration must I find in the face
of affairs was I transported thither since each revolving
day

day brings a change - I have not had the pleasure
of a line from A Finlay since he went to Dublin
nor for some time before: indeed I am not at all
surprised that my pitiful efforts in the epistotary
[unclear][/unclear] should prove dissatisfactory as there is need
of a great share of partiality & affection to support
them in the manner thou [unclear]dost[/unclear]
Pray present me respectfully to D Christy, Billy &
ignore from torn page

Friends then
I am, Dear Molly
