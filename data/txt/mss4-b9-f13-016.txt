& only a few minutes time to summon any others

Richmond 3rd 2nd 1825
My dearest Sarah -
I have just got & read thy welcome welcome
letter - oh! the talk of old times is delightful & now I could write
thee a long letter - but unfortunately I have to go to a dinner party
at Summerville, to meet a bride & bridegroom - old creatures!
an old maid & a twice told widower Sally Hill & Matt Fitts
I have been intending to write to thee by an opportunity
I heard of so I am not as bad as thou might think me
Indeed I do remember our walk to [unclear]Byres's[/unclear]s & many another
too - dost thou recollect our hot walk to Harrington's! oh! my
lassie & the loss of the pencil case & my reading most vilely for
Edward & Edward singing not vilely for us. - oh! it is sweet
to think of auld lang syne. - Sally came mend a pen for me.
Thankee my pet - well tis only middling but better than nothing
And now for good news & welcome news to thee dearest Sarah
We intend going to Ballitore in about a month - & thou
wilt meet us in Ballitore & I will go to Dublin afterwards
either with thee or after the meeting. - I wish that meeting
was not coming in between my visit - but it cant
be helped. - I am very sorry Maggie is delicate - I fear
the odious city air injures her - yet perhaps when [unclear]all[/unclear]
all her teeth are out she will grow strong. I am longing
to see her & Johnnie & Betty Bottle. Be it known to thee
Joseph is not a blackeyed boy at all - his eyes are either
blue or hazle & I dont know which - & indeed in sober
truth he is not very handsome at all - but a fine stout

to my aid - You ask why I do not write - Edward
must forgive me for a while for I really am not
able to sit down to a regular letter - Joze absorbs
my leisure hours, for Lyd throws him to my protection
when I return from my business - he is an
entertaining companion enough but very much in the
way of any quiet settled occupation - I must wait
for him to be better able to contribute to his own amusement
before I can well deny him my assistance -
It is pleasant to hear from you now & then my dear
sister & it adds much to our happiness to think of yours
I expect little Mag will be finely when
her teeth are accomplished - It is fortunate
for us that Joze teeth are not
troublesome in their coming, speaking comparatively
He is now cutting his up teeth - but have [unclear]fa[/unclear] me
sure it is Lyd should tell nursery news - I am writing
so fast & badly that I fear you cannot understand
me - We think of visiting Ballitore before this month
expires if I can prevail on Lyd to wean Joseph entirely
We promise ourselves much pleasure in our Ballitore
visit - I wish we could meet our dear Sarah there
you - I mean my sister & your dear good man
& your wee ones - but we shall see you in Dublin
at all events - both however were [unclear][/unclear] I have now

read Lyds part of this I have written "fudge" to one part
as being merely an unnecessary & undeserved compliment
[unclear][/unclear] I heartily join & that is that I beg & intreat
& heartily desire that dear Edwd & Sarah will come to
us in the Summer - It would be exceedingly delightful
to have you & I expect we will - We have been
both in Dublin - ah Sally my dear Sister you owe
us a visit & you must come see us - We shall see
you soon & will add our viv√£ voce persuasions
to the weak accents of our pens - accounts! (a bull)
no matter so you had us - I write amidst talk - and
I fear very incoherently - better say farewell my dearest sister
I am yours affectionately SJF
for Sarah
