Stradbally 10th of 10th [unclear]mo[/unclear] 1833
My dear Eliza
I was thinking a good deal of
you since we parted I hope the
children are beter & that Francis has
got some help & that thou art a
little more at liberty & Lucy
less anxious perhaps we may
see thee in Ballitore on 1st day
Lydia & I intend to be there if we
can I found James [unclear]delicate[/unclear] [unclear]enough[/unclear]
 [unclear]Joseph[/unclear] not near so well as when
he was in Dublin. M [unclear][/unclear] very busy
getting in Corn he reported Sam
Wright to call for him to go to
look at a Mill in the Co Wexford
but I believe he has put off his
plan as he sent an apology to
Richd instead of himself - by the by
S Wright brought word

when he was here last that Isabelle
Franklin was going to be married
I dont know to whom - I saw
very few in Ballitore the day we
left you we dined with Elith &
came here to [unclear][/unclear] - I wrote the above
last night I may say in the dark, this morning
brought me a letter from Edw very short
but saying all were well & that my mother was
setting out for Dunlavin so perhaps I may
see her on my way back or in Ballitore
there are 3 English men here at present
2 slept here last night the other arrived
this morning Eben & Ellen are here also,
on their way from Abbeyleix they drive
a Phaeton & pair they seem in good
spirits Ellen talks of driving herself to Dunlavin
to see you [insertion]all[/insertion] there I hope the children are

better ours are very well & are not
coughing so I suppose there is no fear
of it being the hooping cough - I gave
thy love to M Doyle she looks badly
& is very feeble but as affectionate as
ever my poor aunt Sally is wearing away
too Sally White surpriz'd me she
seem'd so much her former self
Joseph Harvey & Hannah were at [unclear]Ge[/unclear]
last night on their way home, the mo.
meeting is in Ballitore to day - Ballitore
is the place after all for variety
there is incessant changing there
Henry Allen is better he is able to
sit up now, I am trying to keep Selina
asleep while I write, we have got a

long potato bucket for a cradle it [unclear]does us[/unclear]
very well as the bottom is so rough
that it can be rock'd in a sort of a
way - this day promises to be fine
the weather has been extremely cold
Lydias children are all well except
Joseph - poor Josep I think will be spoil'd
if he live
11th I have a friend to send this by
 Ballitore with love to F & Lucy ever thy AB
we mean to be [unclear]early[/unclear] in Ballitore
on 1st day that we may leave it early
