My dear Cousin,
	+++ Thy account of T. C. is very agreeable, hope it will please Divine Providence to restore spare him, & sanctify this dispensation to him. We want sanctified spirits amongst us: we have worldy-wise people, we have some tolerably skilled in handling the outward law, & we have half-baked cakes  but spirits tried as gold is tried, refined, baptized seven times & so purified we want in the house ++++
It is like thou hast heard of two of our friends in America dying of the camp-fever in the place of their exile, John Hunt & Thomas Gilpin, that the former had previously suffered the amputation of his leg - I am told that the survivors obtained liberty to return home, on the application of some of their wives to the Congress. ++ We hear that dear, honest Thomas Gawthrop has been deeply dipped into sympathy with friends there, so that in consideration of their distress & famine, he could not eat a pleasant meal himself. - that one of his daughters had saved 50 in his absence - that on his coming home, he immediately inquired into her savings or earnings for him, & finding that she had got together that sum & had put it out to interest, that he immediately took it up, & applied it to the relief of his suffering brethren in America, though perhaps it was the bulk of his living. +++
The good prospect there is of thy whole flock manifests under whose gracious care & protection they have mercifully been, even his whose covenants & promises are sure. May it above all things be our solicitude to cultivate an interest with him who has all power in his hand, & controls human events at his pleasure: in the first place taking diligent heed to ourselves, & then, as we feel our minds enlarged & influenced, not only temporally, but spiritually, ready to distribute, willing to communicate, which is the way to lay up ^in^ store a good foundation against the time to come. & to this we are also further encouraged by this expression to do good & ^to^ communicate forget not, for with such sacrifices God is well pleased. How widely different are the consequences annexed to the condition of, If ye be willing & obedient, & that of, But if ye refuse & rebel! In our little communications of this sort as Truth may open our minds, let us attend to the Apostles remark & exhortation, He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly: & he which soweth bountifully; and shall reap also bountifully: and, let us give, not grudgingly, or of necessity; for God loveth a cheerful Giver.
