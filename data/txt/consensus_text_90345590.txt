telling of poor Alexander's death -
At about 6 O'clock on 2nd.. day
morning he breathed his last.
Poor Anne will feel very lonely now.
Ah! that is the way - one after
another drops off and we know
not when our own turn may come.
Ned took his bath to day for the
first time since that little attack
he had - Mrs Carrol and Jos
came out to see us - they brought
with them a young girl named
Emily Morris very pretty and a
niece of Mrs Carrol's - I believe.
We had some delightful singing
after tea - Charlie and Patrick
still trying to kill time. P.
27th.. Thursday - Fine - Two
letters this morning one from
T H the other a mere scrap from
Polly. Ned and I took a
very pretty walk this morning
