the Pikes to whom we had
been invited. But to our
grief, no covered car could
be found so as it was so
late and so wet we thought
it better not to mind going,
at all - The girls came in
at three O'clock. After
dinner we four took
a car and having left
Florence at the train, we
went to Annesley's and
bought new bonnets, then
to Paper Mart in Dame st
and home. Aunt Eliza
called to day.
