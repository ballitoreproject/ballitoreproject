Coniston Decr. 19 - 7
My dear Friend
I should sooner have thank'd you for your kind
letter, & obliging permission to print all the praises you have bestow'd
on us, - but I have been waiting for a frank. I am persuaded neither
my letters, or thanks, are worth postage - & therefore I have delay'd writing
till Turpin sets off to Edinburgh, in order to attend Kitty's second
confinement, - where I expect a Member of Parliament may be found -
but sho.d I be again disappointed, I must really beg leave to tax your
pocket, rather than appear ungrateful for your continued kind attention.
I fear you will think me very fickle, when I tell you,
that after perusing the M.S.S. in which your elegant lines were
inserted, - & after adding myself a Note which named the amiable
Authoress, & her intended publication. - I should then object to the
publication of them, - I really thought the subject unworthy of the
sweet praise bestow'd, & fear'd it would be sounding my own Trumpet
to consent to their appearing. However, I submitted this matter,
as I do all others, - to Mrs. Bowdler's consideration. The Work is delay'd
for nearly three Months, in consequence of my Vanity,- I am anxious
for an Engraving of my beloved Daur. because I wish the
World (& particularly the younger part of it) to see, that Piety & Learning,
are not incompatible with Youth & Beauty. I am too, apt to
judge of others, from myself, & I always read a Book with more interest

from having some idea of the person of the Author. I do not suppose
the sale of the Work will [underline]pay [/underline]for this vanity, but the Mother's feelings will
be abundantly gratified - I perfectly understand your sensations on delivering
your Copy into the Printer's hands, for I am in some degree experiencing the
same myself, - as Mrs. B. has made very large extracts from Letters of mine,
which certainly never were intended for the public eye. May God bless our
endeavours, my dear Friend, & send us unscorch'd through the fiery ordeal of
Reviewers, & Critics! - To be sure I am like the Fly on the Chariot wheel,
when I talk of [underline]Us[/underline] - I hope you will experience all that candour, which so
peculiarly marks your own Character, - & have full credit given you, not
only for the extent of your Abilities , but for the benevolence of your heart!
No one will more sincerely rejoice at your success than I shall, because
I know how well it will be deserved. One part of your letter affords me
the highest satisfaction, for however partially you may over-rate my
powers, you certainly do no more than justice to my good intentions,
I allude to our former conversations. I could say nothing to you on the
subject of Faith, which your own excellent understanding would not
better suggest, - provided you allow'd it to be unbiass'd by others,- but
I will own to you, I had my fears lest the affection you naturally felt
for yr. Brother, & the esteem in which you held his talents might lead
you to adopt his Opinions, because they [underline]were his[/underline] - without examining
the fallacy of them. There is a comfort in a steady Faith, which nothing
Earthly can bestow; it has been my support in various trials, & makes
me fearless of those I may still have to encounter_ - I do not say this, as
presumptuously trusting in my [underline]own strength[/underline], for I am fully sensible,
(& I thank God I am so) of my extreme weakness,- but I know that our

Heavenly Father never refuses support to those who sincerely ask for it -
You will not therefore wonder that I anxiously wish all those I love,
should have the same confidence, & the same comfort_ I am glad you
approve of "the Progress of the Pilgrim Good-Intent" - it is a strong, but just
Satire of that Philosophy (falsely so call'd) which led to the French Revolution,-
& which, if it prevails, will Revolutionize the whole World_ - The
Author is a Lady, but I am not at liberty to name her. I hope sweet
Richard likes this Book too, & that he will be so old fashion'd as to
love his Parents, [underline]better[/underline] than the Natives of Indostan,- I think he is
bound by Gratitude, & affection, to accede to their wishes & administer
to their comforts_ - He was a lovely Boy, & I should grieve to have him
a Modern Philosopher. Turpin's Carriage is at the door, & I can only
take time to assure you, I am always rejoiced to receive your letters, & to
hear of the welfare of my Ballitore Friends - remember me affectionately
to them all - & believe me with great Esteem Your very sincere Friend
J.S
I will thank you to remind Mr. Bewley
that he has never acknowledged the rect. of the money -
