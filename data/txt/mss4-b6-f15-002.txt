A Meditation
Now from this world I wing my way
To gain that blest abode
Where storms nor tempests never come
But all is Peace with God
2
He is Heaven himself to alone [deletion]without[/deletion]
Without the Splendid joys
that is ever lasting sound his throne
my God himself is my Choice
3
Farwell vain world and all thy joys
most chearfully adore
thy Pomps and [unclear]Franotery[/unclear] toys
I toast of joys that's new
4
unto the Holly Bath I [unclear]come[/unclear] [deletion]of thy[/deletion]
of thy Most Precious Blood
And Bear & [unclear] mark it [/unclear] Let me Bound
into that Living Blood
5
That ishued from thy Blessed ride
[unclear] Cured [/unclear] by the tyrant's hands
The Baths of Death Boldly trod
And now thryumphant stands
6

I will clean my soul from every spot
from each defiling stain
I will make it [unclear][/unclear] & clear as day
washed in that Purple straim
7
Oh Lit me seek thee in the night
and hold thee as me rest
thy precious feet to Beath with tears
And sleep upon thy Breast
8
[unclear]..y[/unclear] captive Soul that missed so Long
Thy Peace & heavenly joys
And Let thy [unclear]preacous[/unclear] hind to wet
thy [unclear]??s[/unclear] with midnight dews
thy [deletion][/deletion] [unclear][/unclear] with midnight dews
[deletion][/deletion]
