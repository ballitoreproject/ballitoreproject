I can assure my dear Father it was not because I was easy about writing to him that I did not soon^er^ acknowledge the receipt of his very kind letter from England, a favour I could not have expected considering other important engagements, but I was comforted that I was remembered when I am precluded the society of part of my family & friends; I thought considering the confined situation of our house that a few months breathing the country air would strengthen us, & promote the childrens health, accordingly my Husband procured us a little house near Uncle Sparrows, on a rising ground, commanding a pretty view of the town & a short walk from thence, but it has so happened that the young child I am nursing has been at times very poorly, about 3 weeks ago he was so, & then recovered & was thriving, but last fifth day he was again attacked with something fevering, rested very broken those two nights past, his skin very hot, & cryed [sic] sadly, so that nancy & I had full employment in the nights, we gave him two drops of laudanum last night, & he quieted almost directly; we thought it full time to wean Robert, & began it about a week ago, by some means he has got a cold, is about his jaw teeth & having lost his breast [?] is much tried, he seems to have no appetite, nor desire to drink, nor cannot be got hardly to drink, as if he disliked to put any thing in his mouth, Nurse says had a puking & looseness in the night, so I am quite frightened about him, I got him to eat a fresh egg to day, doubtless the suck (which he is deprived of) supplied all those wants, he is about a year & half old: as to myself I believe I should be better for this country excursion, only for my anxiety & fatigue with the children, Samuel & Margaret are very hearty. Abraham in town with his Father, the latter endeavours to come to us at times, but the former seldom comes, he seems to be a great comfort to his Father, being very attentive & dutiful to him, so that sometimes tears of satisfaction arise in his eyes, & he says he ^there^ is a great guard over him to set him no improper example, he endeavours also to watch diligently ^over^ him, without letting ^him^ think he is any way afraid of his acting wrong, so that Abraham makes a companion of his Father who takes pleasure in his chat & remarks, which he says are very comical & original, so that the Men look & smile at him sometimes, I believe he no way affects it, but has something singular in his manner, I am afraid he will appear odd to strangers. Now I have taken up a great part of the letter about the poor young plants it is time for me to turn to a more important subject of thing & my dear Mothers health, we were much alarmed at hearing of her being so very poorly, & only I was [sic] a Nurse should have been to see her I believe before now. I hope thy arrival, favourable journey, & inward support will tend to revive & cheer her, & no doubt but that which led & fed her all her life long, & which she was so wise as to follow & depend on, thro time, will continue to assist & support: without this we are weak indeed, therefore how happy are those who have chosen the good part, & so walked, & so lived, that it never has been taken from them, Oh I often fear losing this precious sense of divine favour, & of being swallowed up by the floods of temptation to spiritual indolence carelessness, & over cumber [?], things that proceed more from the perplexity of my own disposition [word crossed out] than real necessity to be so, for other Women as well as I, have their domestick occupations [seal] Providence sees our hearts, & may he be graciously pleased in mercy to our immortal Souls, often to create in us clean hearts, & renew a right spirit within us, often to grant admittance to that fountain, which is set open for Sin & for uncleanness, & also to [words crossed out] sit in judgment: as a refiner with fire, to purify & prepare us to offer an offering in righteousness, being convinced that holiness becomes hi house for every. I may say I long much to see your faces my dear Parents, who have been so truly, so inexpressibly kind & tender to me, & I have thought your prayers have secretly & effectually (shall I say?) mediated on my behalf, & helped to keep me from being quite a castaway from the divine presence, & feeling my spirit so united, & bound to you my very dear Parents, I have a hope a little ^life^ is left me thro all  & if I can steer so thro the remainder of time, as to land in the haven of rest, it will be all thor adorable mercy to me, seeming so undeserving of manifold favours received. I enjoyed thy account of satisfaction received in meeting with new acquaintance in the right line, & no doubt but such were comforted with meeting thee, how is our ancient, honourable friend Esther Tuke? have [sic] you settled your affairs together? how did she seem? I was obliged by the yearly epistle, tho rather shorter than sometimes, yet I thought it weighty, & rather a proper example from such a meeting, not to be too flowery in expression, or making it a point to write much
Please tell my kind Brother & sister Abraham & Sally I received their letters, hope they will excuse me addressing them by letter at present poor M: Mellor has been a trouble to you; her sister is to be pitied about her, but as Abraham they are crucified to her, & therefore all must be left, & she must bear her own burden, happy if it brings her to see how greatly she has trespassed, & to seek for a place of repentance, which that she [paper torn] & find, is her real friends desire for her. My Husband and childrens dear love to you all, & I conclude
        thy Margaret Grubb
