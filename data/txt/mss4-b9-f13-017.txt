[underline]James's very dear[/underline] love Richmond 19th of 9th mo 1826
My dearest Sarah
I may appear to have been negligent
of thee & thine but indeed it has been only appearance for
my thoughts have been greatly with you & my imagination
often brings before me the sweet but anxious countenance
of my darling little Willie oh! how closely a suffering infant
is bound to one's heart, nothing can so plainly show how
beloved any one is as sickness. This is badly said but
thou canst understand me. Where art thou? I heard
from Fitzsimmons in Kilkenny that thy mother &
Selina had returned to Dublin - I hope thou not yet as
home - oh how I wish thou & Willie were here & how
much I desired it when I saw my own [unclear]flowery[/unclear] Mary
I was greatly enjoyed the few days we remained in
Ballitore after we left you from thence we travelled with
as much rapidity as we could command without offending
our kind & hospitable friends there, & there & every where
Aunt Grubb seemed finely & aunt Sally in great clover
enjoying one of her highest gratifications, plenty of invitations
We staid the whole of one day & part of another at
Ballibrado where[unclear][/unclear] with aunt Fennell
At length we got home & were met at the Post office by
Peter Mester. Sally & Jose - Jose scarcely seemed to know
me, yet I think he did for he grew quite red - & seemed
pleased with my embraces Mary was not one bit
shy & next prefers me even before Sally who was wont
to be her best beloved. I found her very much encreased
in robustness & intelligence. She speaks several words
viz: Papa, Mama, Baba, [underline][unclear]Phade[/unclear][/underline] peep" &c &c She is extremely
lively. Jose has acquired the plain language - says "a dee
pease" for "if thee please" & when spoken to in a silly
manner says "Nonsense!" But his various accomplishments
are too numerous for even a mother's pen. I hope thou wilt
My dear Edward/ I hope you were fully paid by Mr A Patrick
Co - I am obliged for your advance on their account - Do you
know of any way I could employ myself to advantage in Dublin
or any where else either on my own account or that of others -
I shall be shortly casting about to settle myself in some business
or other as my uncle James & I are about to separate interests
by mutual consent- If I find I can do any thing at home
to advantage I shall prefer remaining with my father but otherwise
I must look abroad Merchandize in my trade & to that
I mean to look unless some kind Christian joins me in a
Mill & teaches me his business We hope to hear from you
soon that Willie is better & Sarah in good spirits - There's rhyme
& reason in health & wealth - two great blessings - perhaps not the
greatest- I enjoyed our visit to Sam Houghton's Sally is a superior
woman - it is a pity such people have any failings- Sally
has two- She dresses too grandily & takes her children to a Presbyterian
meeting every Sunday - but after six hours of her company
My dear Sarah
I got [unclear]to town[/unclear] safely and found this letter
which I opened - I wish you could send
them by post a list of all the articles
[unclear]you still want for the cottage in order that[/unclear]
I may send them on first opportunity
I hope your [unclear]head[/unclear] is better
yours

be as minute about thy [underline]"sheebeens"[/underline] I am certain thou love
mine therefore always believe thine are dear to me in the
same proportion. How is dear Betsy? give her my warm love
& how is [insertion]her[/insertion] patient? I shall be very glad to hear of their
removal to Ballitore. James & I saw George Harvey in
Clonmel - in a coach travelling to Cove, he looked better
& seemed more cheerful, he was attended by his brother
Tom. Farther saith not. Hannah Harvey has been very
poorly with some nervous complaint which has been
extremely distressing & her mother has been miserably
anxious. however she is now better & of course her
mother revives. please tell this to Betsy. The remainder
of the families are well. Eliza has not lain in yet.
And have I not one word to say to Edward - why
then, if I do not say one syllable it will not be for want
of having plenty of chat if I had my wits about me, which
are indeed sadly scattered. We found every thing here
as much to our mind as it was possible to be, Oh!
the delight of getting home. "There is no place like home"
indeed. But I do not mean to imply that I did not enjoy
my self highly amongst you. [deletion][/deletion] I have news
to tell thee & I think more about thyself & Willie than
of any thing else, so as I know so little about you
my letter must needs be stupid & uninteresting
I beg thou wilt tell Richd Webb that I would thank
him to send "Anster's Poems" [underline]direct[/underline] to Mary Shackleton
& The bridal of Triermain to Elzth & to consider me
his debtor for the finding of both, & [insertion]for[/insertion] his kindness in
getting them done for me. We also saw John O'Neil in
the coach going to the hill in Clonmel. Catherine
Gratton called on me today to take leave of me
she means to settle in Dublin, & is to go next
I forgot those peccadilloes - I like her for what she retains of
her father's spirit, although it is sometimes alloyed by a womanish
weakness - I mean a want of coolness & justice in her decisions
suffering her reason to be too much carried away by her feelings
but are you acquainted with her? - If not, why do I inflict
her character upon you - I wish we could live near you &
Ballitore & yet not give up my father & Sally - This life is so
short that it requires a very strong faith in the promises of another
to reconcile us to live so long & so far separate from our
best friends -
Yours affecionately
[underline]J. J. F.[/underline]

week - her furniture is selling by auction - I regret
her leaving Limerick greatly - on her own account, for
I understand she was getting on well - & on mine for
though I had not much intercourse with her, yet she
felt like a Ballitore body & her conversation always
refreshed me. however much worse than that must be
borne. I left Johnny's frock with his aunt Elizabeth
for him. Jose would not consent to wear his "[underline]chowsers[/underline]"
on any account so I was disappointed - & must patiently
wait until he pleases to assume the "toga virilis" alas!
Time the great alterationer will soon turn my "kitten into
a cat" my boy into a man, my Jose into a Joseph.
And why "alas!"? but no moralizing. I mean to send
thee the trousers shortly, for Meg - she will make no
objections to wearing them - what woman does not like
to wear the breeches? At present I work nothing - I read
nothing - I do nothing but look at my children's happy
faces & think how happy I am & ought to be.
I hope Sally will shortly set out on her travels & I
hope thou wilt see her.
I am even more impatient
than she is to get her from
home - for she wants recreation, she has been every thing
that was tender & loving to the children. Susan Todhunter
is still at Summerville & appears healthy enough
but I hear she is delicate. Sally had two letters lately
from Thomas. he speaks, in one, of an extraordinary
meeting he had with Elizth Dudley & Martha Savery
I know not whether is was in an opportunity they
spoke to him or not. - They met him in the street one
day when he was particularly dull, & thought no one was
thinking of him & his sorrows, & they were cordial in

their manners. They invited him home to dine. They [unclear]spoke[/unclear]
to him of Ballitore, our mother, & Betsy, & at length [deletion]asked[/deletion] E.
asked him "were his visits to Lewes at an end" - he told them
they were, then Martha S- spoke to him in a most consoling &
affectionate manner. E Dudley followed & both told him they
had often felt deeply for him & he was very frequently the
companion of their thoughts. Thomas's spirits are greatly improved
since, for sympathy was new to him in London & he little expected
to find it. I tell thee this & thou may tell it to Betsy
as I know it would gratify her - but charge her not to mention it
at all, for Thomas begs we will not tell it about, & very probably he
will tell herself of it. And besure do thou not permit it to go farther
than Edward, for such things should not be made the subjects of conversation -
they are private & should be kept so - this was at least.
I have little more to add than to entreat thou wilt speedily tell
me all about Willie, not forgetting Meg & Jack & dearest Sarah of thy
own dear self. I wondered how quietly I parted from thee & apparently
for a long time. The countenance often does not express all we feel
& yet sometimes it is but too true an index or looking glass. Dear love to Edwd
from his & thine ever afte. LJ Fisher

I found Betsy Leckey still here, but she is to
go tomorrow to Co Carlow. James's dear
love to thee.
