7_ Feb. 1811
A few days ago, my kind friend, I was very agreeably surprised
by receiving a very friendly & polite letter from thy amiable
son by the coach, accompanying the last Edinburgh Review; & this
day I received by the carrier the packet thou sent by him. How
extraordinary kind you are! The American's letter appears fraught
with information. The Edinburgh Review can never be too old:
the critique on the Lady of the Lake is a capital one, such as that
capital Poem deserves. The Repository has at least the merit of
beautiful engraving, which some of my children propose my
having framed & glazed. But old & young & middle-aged are
delighted & entertained with little Fanny, who will I expect
accompany us in our visits for some time, & amuse our visitors. It is
really a very ingenious invention. The books for Ballybarney shall be
safely kept with the rest I intend till a proper opportunity for distribution.
I offered one to little Pat Farrell, who reckoned he was beyond
that book, yet when I tried him he could not read it, therefore I took it
from him, & told him he should not have Martin & James, [deletion]on[/deletion] [insertion]to[/insertion] which his
ambition aspired, till he could read it. I was rejoiced to hear that
thou wert well, for, though I am ashamed to [deletion]own[/deletion] say it, I thought it long
Thy friend[deletion]s[/deletion] Sheridan's daughter's husband is of a Scotch family mentioned in the
Lady of the Lake I hear - about, one daughter
remains with her, & 'tis thought that
she is now at Bath. [unclear]As[/unclear] if thy [unclear]Jon[/unclear] knew what we are now about the Review he
[unclear]sent[/unclear] me [unclear]treated[/unclear] Largely of Lancaster's schools.

since I heard from thee, & I was afraid little William was not well
but I rejoice to hear that the sweet buds are unfolding & escape a blight.
I thought Francis would soon be the companion of his Parents, what a
source of mutual happiness is this! I am unwilling to bring any
gloom across the brightness of thy sky; but thou art desirous I know to hear
how my niece is, her cough is better, & other symptoms abated, but her strength
rather declines, & her constant & faithful attendant her sister Betsy, I find
has scarce a glimpse of hope. Betsy has a strong mind & great sensibility,
& there occasion an internal struggle which is visible in her countenance
a servant maid who had also this fatal typhus fever, & lingered since apparently
recovery, suddenly changed for the worse & died in my nephew's house two days
ago. This has increased our apprehensions. As if sent to cheer & strengthen our
minds by turning our thoughts into a channel of usefulness, our new
neighbour Margaret Bonham is continually planning some scheme of beneficence
she says she believes thou know some of her husband's family. His mother's
name was Leslie, daughter to a Bishop of Limerick. He has spent most of
his life in England, lived lately in the Isle of Wight; his wife is an Englishwoman.
She knows thy friend the widow of Charles Sheridan, she was lately,
Margaret Bonham says, at Cheltenham, & that her two daughters are well
married, one to a gentleman by name Bid[insertion]d[/insertion]ell - the other name I forget, having
lost the memorandum I took. Before these worthy persons came here we had
got the Schoolmaster of the Sunday School (Rose's son Tommy) instructed in
Dublin in Lancaster's plan, & have now opened a daily school. Farmers & shopkeepers
to pay 6d. [unclear]per[/unclear] week, tradesmen 4d. & labourers 2d. There are 70 scholars

& we are about opening a school for girls also. Margt. Bonham & I think it
would be a great saving of time, trouble, &c, if the young man who offers to be
schoolmaster to Ballybarney would permit himself to be organized by J: Doyle,
& establish his school on that plan. I have not yet seen the young man, perhaps
by seeing & talking to him he might be found open to conviction of the
superiority of Lancaster's mode. It is proposed that a little Dispensary
be established here, under the direction of our Dr. a subscription is set on foot,
5five shillings annually, to be paid by each subscriber, except that John
& Margt Bonham each pay ten. It occurred to me to propose thy joining, &
that thy tenantry should have the advantage also of this proposal, but I
have not mentioned thy name on this occasion. The premium thou
mentions to boys above 12 I have not yet mentioned, being not yet
[unclear][/unclear]ed of the age under which they are claimed. I made up
the parcel for Mick Dillon with great pleasure, & having sent
for him, as I advanced to present it, I was disappointed at not meeting
reciprocal pleasure in his countenace - but much more so when he told
me that his little babe was no more. Chincough had brought on convulsions
& the pure spirit soon made its escape from earth. Two other of his children
are labouring under the chincough, & instead of thy intended gift I would propose
giving to them two pair of warm stockings & two flannel waistcoats if
thou approves. I expect soon to have the petticoat ready for Nurse Farrell,
& through our good Alice Cornwall propose her knitting in like manner
as thou directed, & if agreeable I could provide the yarn here, as a poor woman
is thankful to be employed in spinning it. As to the [unclear]Printer[/unclear] there
is no want of it at present, nor would we wish for [insertion]it[/insertion] except to have the benefit

of thy remarks, but at any time it can be forwarded to me under cover to Robt.
Webb Dame Street Dublin & that under cover to Wm. Taylor Esqr. Dublin Castle
My husband's niece has lately married. R Webb's brother, John Webb a clergyman
I sent Tobit to him to forward to thee, & he told me he expected Lord Charleville
would frank it. There has been great snow about Dublin, but not much
here. I am ashamed of the delay in publishing the Cottage Dialogues
it is owing to my Dublin printer now waiting till the MS is returned from
Johnson, who I expect has [deletion]now[/deletion] [insertion]ere this[/insertion] published it
I am, with sincere respect & affection
thy obliged friend
Mary Leadbeater
It is also in prospect to have a nurse
for the sick, & two rooms to remove
the contageous to. -
I have a piece of linen of thine & 6 Belfast Magazines. May I send to the Belfast
the song in thy last?
