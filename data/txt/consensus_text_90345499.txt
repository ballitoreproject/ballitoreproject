Papa and intends soon returning home
After dinner , Ned , Philip , Erasmus
Liddy and I went down to the
sea and had a row for about
an hour which was very pleasant
indeed for us who were well and
able to enjoy it ; but to poor Ned
who was only able to lie at the
end of the boat , I am afraid it
was not much of a pleasure.
5 Tuesday - Doctor Moss came
out early - and thinks Liddy
much better , but gives us a very
discouraging opinion of poor Ned
and wished Marsh to be consulted.
6 Wednesday - Papa brought Ned
to town to see Doctor Stokes but
as he was away from home, they
went to Marsh who says he can
do nothing for him and gives
us I believe no hope of his recovery.
7 Thurday - Lilly was able to
take a ride this evening and
I hope will not be the worse for it.
