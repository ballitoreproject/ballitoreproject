Anna Mills 1st day
Mary Leadbeater
My Aunt bought a nice little Ass and its name is
Robin he caught cold and his nose was very sore when mamma
came home - I have a little saddle for him - and a listing bridle
I am very lonely without Joshua - My Mother was reading me last meeting
day & this meeting day in my brother John's book about good children dying
Anna & Priscilla were with us. we were standing by my mothers bed
side - becasue she was not able to be up - Joshua told me two nights
before he died to be good. and not beat the dogs - and I am trying
to be good. I have ten books - one about little Joseph selling into
Egypt - and the moon and the eleven stars & the Lion. Joshua
had the Grecian history and it was given to Eliza - and I have a
little purple bible- I am trying to get the hymns off by heart
I have nearly got one verse - Deborah teaches me every day
I am going to get a new book for reading. - I am going on to
eight - if Joshua lived he would be after nine. Lydia
is eleven. and Eliza is past twelve. I hope thou wilts
be here soon I am going into Joshua's business
