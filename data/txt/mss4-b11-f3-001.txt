in what ever estate we are thear with to be content
which ye appostle witnessed (with godlyness) to be great game
but oh dear Brother ye sweet influances of devine favour
fills ye soule at times with an holy disdain of temperall
joyments so that they are not of great moment with
us but we are in a holy admiration made to say with the
Psalmist Lord what is man that thou shouldest thus -
visit him have we not som times been thus made to [insertion]say[/insertion] in
the secret of our hearts when the visitation of the
almighty hath been upon [deletion]or[/deletion] our souls oh that theas
sweet seasons of devine Love mey not be forgotten;
but that they mey remain as obbligations uppon our
hearts to more faithfullness that the great giver thearof
mey be gloryfied and our souls eternaly Comforted
which is the true and for which the Lord is no gratiously
pleased to visit us which and I greatly desire may never
be frustrated by us I have this spring reicd two letters
