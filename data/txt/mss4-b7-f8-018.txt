How happy am I, my dear Molly, that
can now at length congratulate thee on thy recovery!
This day's post brings the very pleasing intelligence
that thou art able to undertake the journey & that
we shall once more have thee among us. Delightful
thought! again shall enjoy thee after an absence
rendered a thousand times more disagreeable
by thy dangerous situation. May thy health and
spirits continued to increase, and may Ballitore's
pure air soon shew thee to be perfectly established
The two Sister's set off for Mountmelick sixth day
morning; their company was very agreeable; but
yet it did not prevent us regretting the want
of thine. Nancy was very kind in visiting thee
so frequently; if she had remained in Dublin
she

she would not let thee have reason to complain of being
deserted Several of the boys seemed interested about
thee: The Doctor [Leadbeater] Harper. W: Conyngham were
among the foremost but Coote thy constant Charles
regularly every post day enquired What account from
Molly? I had like to have forgot Lapham & Palmer.
It is almost out of season to thank thee for thy
kindness in executing my commissions so satisfactorily
I must request thou wilt add to the obligation
by prevailing on Peter Cambridge to take this affair
in hands - The other day I let my watch fall out
of my fingers & broke the crystal, & as I had before
fallen out with the dial plate, I thought it would
be a good time to get a new one put in, of the
modern taste I assure thee, no less. Peter's readiness to
oblige encourages me to make this request I inclose
a crown give him whatever will be necessary & he
will

will be kind enough to send it by the first opportunity.
There was but one letter from [unclear]Rawdon[/unclear] since he went
he expected every day to be ordered over to join his
regiment at Coxheath With him the Boys [unclear]se[/unclear] to
have lost all their military ardour - But, guess
what! sure I received a letter from Tom Pim: the
stile will surprize thee. Who would imagine he wou'd
turn Preacher - Farewell, my dear, till we meet
