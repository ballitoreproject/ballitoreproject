S. Godlee married John Rickman
of Edinburgh, having
My dear friend
jilted Dr. Fisher.
As the "precious link" which
once formed a kind of connexion between
us is now broken, I do not know how to
resist the strong impulse which I feel [deletion]now[/deletion]
to address thee - nor can I believe that in
so doing I am violating the agreement of
silence, & expression of intercourse which [insertion]now[/insertion] appears
to be the source of propriety - for it is not of
him who formed the link that I would
desire information nor of myself that I
now speak to thee - but of one very dear
to thee & much beloved by [deletion]my[/deletion] me -
thy precious Lydia - 'tis true I know
her not & that perhaps if I saw her this
moment she might [underline]look[/underline] like a stranger
to me - but she has long ceased to be a
stranger to my heart & long been a
source of affectionate interest to me - How
then can I bear to remain in ignorance of
her just now when she is the very frequent
anxiety about her & my knowledge that Thomas was
& my confidence in your prudence not to mention it
far distant from [unclear]me[/unclear] could have allowed me
to think it - I remain with much regard
thy sincerely afft. & grateful friend
Sarah Godlee

subject of my anxious thought - My Aunt
Payne who visited Limerick some months
back gave me intelligence about her which
made me very anxious to hear from her ever
since - hath thy journey just now
convinces me that I must not hope for this
pleasure and makes [insertion]me[/insertion] every day lament
that every source of information about her
appears closed - I have however at length
[unclear]ventured[/unclear] to make thee my friend - thy
former kindness almost warrants it. Il
[deletion]son[/deletion] beg of thee as an especial favour that
when the intruding event which you must now
be soon expecting has occurred & when every
other of your numerous friends has been
furnished with the joyful tidings - thou
wilt be kind enough to think of me & favour
me once again with one of thy truly acceptable
letters - Dear Lydia has my most earnest
& heartfelt good wishes for her safety during
the trying hour which is approaching with
such a mother & with such kind friends

around her & a heart given to hope & above
all a firm reliance on that power "who orders
all things vile" & without whose guiding
hand we should in vain endeavour & direct
our steps - I trust their is every reason to look
forward for a happy termination to our present
anxious wishes.
Perhaps I ought sooner to have adverted to thy
two very kind letters for both of which I beg thou
wilt receive my sincere thanks - It must be
a great disappointment to thee to have lost thy
Limerick friend just before thou hoped to see
her - & thy beloved sister too is gone! - these
are the bitterest griefs of those advanced in
years - yet "Woe unto us", not her - for she sleeps on
Most gladly would I accept a place amongst
the ranks of thy young friends which thou offers
me - but perhaps I must not now aspire after
it - Besides I am not sure that I should
belong to it - Hours can sometimes do the work of
years - & I have known some of these age hastening
hours - they have hoped over and left their traces
in my heart - this but a [insertion]comparatively[/insertion] short time ago that I
smiled at the thought of sadness of any kind
I said that good spirits and a cheerful mind
could carry me through the darkest hours -
but these high spirits vanish at the approach
of grief - & hark us to look for consolation

from a higher source - such a lesson cannot
be bought with litte cost - & I will not
refine through in learning it. I seem to have
lost the elastic spirits, the lofty hoper, & the
vivid pictures of youth - as this is my first letter
to thee so perhaps it may be my last - forgive its imperfections
& I anxiously entreat comply with
its request - In comforting something like hope
testifies to me that my dear Lydia will accept
of my love & will afford me a share of her through
the waters should always roll between us & through
a shadowy friendship alone should unite us
I request that this letter may be confined to thy
eye [deletion]alone[/deletion] & Lydia's only - nothing but my
