East Tarbet Augt 2nd
on board Norma
[1855]
My dear Mamma
Here we are in the
nicest little harbour you can
imagine, it is so small & safe,
it is like a little birds nest
shut up among beautiful hills,
We enjoy it the more as we
got in here, in the midst of
very heavy rain, & some wind,
it blew hard last night & it
seemed so comfortable not
to be exposed to it, I believe

we will stay here today, &
I suppose it is likely we may
get to [unclear]Morrary[/unclear] to-morrow, where
I hope to get the letter I asked
you to write, I wish you would
write a line to [underline]Largs[/underline] [insertion]Post Office[/insertion] Scotland
and I think I would have
a chance of getting it, I cannot
tell you how grateful I feel
to you for the trouble you
have taken in writing to
us, and Manliff was saying
the same thing, it adds
so much to our pleasure
in enjoying those beautiful
places to know that you are
all well - Philip seems to
be enjoying himself very
much after the first two
or three days, he was not
annoyed at all with the
sick feel, and is now a
Capital sailor, we have a
very agreeable Companion in
Mr. Gowan, he has a fine
voice & sings with great
feeling - Manliff's coruopeon,

when we can loan him to
play it, sounds delightful
among these hills, the echo's
[insertion]are[/insertion] so fine - and how I want
to go on shore to try Can
I find a Post Office in this
Romantic place, there is
a fine old Castle here -
farewell with dear love to
all, your much attached
M J B
P. S. please tell M - Gough
 I [deletion]am[/deletion] [insertion]will be /insertion] much obliged for her
calling to look a little after my
servant.
