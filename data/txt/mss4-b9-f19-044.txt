Britain street 30th of 3d mo 1822
I was just going to write Ballitore
My dear Elizth
I did not expect thy letter so soon, as thou
did not give me hopes of one when we parted, but thou art
generally better than thy word, I felt that I was indeed
separated from you when thou wert gone, but I have
recover'd myself & thy letter of intelligence was very reviving
it was just as if thou wert speaking to me, I got one
from Eben & one from Deborah by the same opportunity
I will soon write to Deborah tell her I have got her 1/2 lb
of hops for 5d & tell Lydia I have her pencil waiting for
a carman along with a parcel directed to thee in M Richardson
hand writing I believe it came the day after thou went
now I would be very much obliged if some of you would
write & tell me what I am to [deletion]day[/deletion] do, if the potatoe
[deletion]digging[/deletion] [insertion]planting[/insertion] is not over & that it is not likely our man will
be here soon, I will send them to Adam Calvert's
to go by the next carman, so do not fail to write
I have return'd 3 visits Lucy came along with me
Bess Harvey was quite sorry she miss'd thee she
waited at home till 1/2 past one on first day in
hopes thou'd call & when thou did not, she went
to my aunt Gough's in search of thee, perhaps thou
art now at the quarterly meeting,

But if thou art at home may I give thee some
commissions in the [deletion]fiht[/deletion] first place I would be
much obliged if thou'd procure me as much feathers
& of a quality thou would think good enough for
Mary Kilmarny's bed & further I would thank thee
to buy [deletion]ticking[/deletion] ticken from Mary Doyle & get Betty
Lucas to make it, now do not let me impose
too much on thy kindness, tell me if I do, could thou
get a large piece of linen bleach'd for me at Baltinglass
yard & 1/2 quarter wide & what would the bleaching of it cost
per yd if M Doyle's [deletion]has the small[/deletion] table clothes [insertion]are 2 yds wide &[/insertion] [deletion]still[/deletion] I would
be glad to get two of them they could come with my clothes
now I think I have given thee enough to do, -
I would want a small bolster for the bed, -
We dined & drank tea at my uncle Wrights yesterday
no one there but aunts & cousins, by the by how is EGough
I hear very little of her, - Why does [insertion]not[/insertion] my mother write
me a line? have you sent any thing to me
by Mt melick? - the day after thou went Edw
brought me to Glendruid & we spent the whole day
there & dined on potatoes & milk & bread & butter
& eggs, we rode & the day was very fine, Eliza
has been out since 4th day, yesterday morning
Edw & I rode to the strawberry beds beyond [unclear]Nappelizod[/unclear],
by the water's side, we went thro' the Park
My mother goes to the Glen this evening to stay
+ they should be each 23 1/2 yds long

tomorrow, we are invited to spend to morrow there
but we are not quite sure we shall go -
I did not see A Fayle since, Betsy Bewley call'd
here & I believe she was the only one that did, since
thou wert here, I met J Dillon on one of the Quays
he look'd very well I also met Edw Maguire
he enquired kindly for you all,
Is Lydia getting me the profiles? Ah she is a long
time without writing to me, I forgot that it was
since thou went that M Humphreys & the two Orpens
call'd here & by mistake I did not see them altho'
[unclear][/unclear]t home, my mother was at the Glen that
[unclear][/unclear] they ask'd for Mrs B, Peggy told me th[unclear][/unclear]
[unclear][/unclear] they ask'd for Mrs B, Peggy told [unclear]them[/unclear]
[unclear][/unclear] not at home, so I miss'd them it [unclear]was[/unclear]
the day thou went, I have not got a proof sheet
to correct yet, I wish Christn. was more lively, Dick
Webb call'd here, I'm sorry I did not get my aunt
her shawl in time for the meeting,
farewell with dear love to all ever thine
SB
I have heard nothing of RSL
