turned to take tea with Aunt E
Charlie and I went out by the 7
train and took tea at Trafalgar
Terrace - Florence and I had
a long chat by the fire before going
to bed.
1st.. New Years day - 1854 -
Fassaroe -
Oh! dear! and am I any better?
I am afraid to answer. I wonder
where we shall all be this time
year. Florence and I were
the first at meeting. Philip,
Erasmus and Liddy came from
Fassaroe - the former did not
return with us, as he went off
with Jemmy Perry - We gave
Uncle Richard and Florence a seat
to Glendruid. It was a beautiful
day but piercing cold. Avy and
I had a race up the avenue and
were up before the carriage.
Another year hast past -
Another year had past -
