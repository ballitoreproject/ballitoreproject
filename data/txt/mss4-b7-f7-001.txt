Dear Molly.
When I was Last in the Metropolis of England
one day at the close of a weighty religious select
opportunity, thy truly worthy Father convinced me,
he had not forgot the request made jointly to him
and thee the preceeding Year, by putting into my hand
some productions, of his more than common fertile
Genius on the sensibly awakening subject of the
death of am much Beloved Friend Edith Lovel
who tho' she is dead yet is the remembrance of her
sweet, may we that survive endeavour to copy
her example, by initiating those virtues with which
she was adorned â€” As a choice addition to
the little collection I had before, on occasions of
similar importance, I have deposited them into
my small repository for that purpose, but
time did not then admit of any acknowledgement
to my Valuable Friend, or shou'd certainly
have made an effort towards it, for notwithstanding

I am neither a Gramarian, nor capable of doing
it in the Poetical strain, yet consistent with the Notions
and Ideas I have imbibed of that Gratitude upon
which I think there is a claim of my best observation,
for the manifest token of respect be so kindly conferred
on me by presenting, to me on the truly affecting
theme a piece composed of harmonious numbers without
the least [unclear]jar[/unclear], and with instruction every Line is
fraught, must desire thou will please tell him I am
greatly obliged for the favour of them, also that my
Love awaits his and the whole Family's acceptance
with which I conclude
Thy very Affectionate Friend
Penelope Rathbone
