Richmond 2nd mo 6th 1823
My dear friend
As I have several letters to
write by James & Sally, and my time is much taken
up, I have begun [deletion]this [/deletion]this early for fear of any
thing coming in the way to prevent me answering
thy last acceptable letter. I am obliged to
thee for the receipts which thou wast as kind to
send for my father but as he has physicians in
attendance we would not like to try any, [insertion] things[/insertion] without
their approbation, and those of that profession
seldom approve of any thing but what they order
themselves. However my father's present treatment
seems to agree with him, he has been improving
these 2 weeks, his appetite and strength in a good
degree returned, and we hope when mild weather
appears he will be quite restored. I suppose
you hear pretty regularly through James how he
goes on. The presentation seems to have been
agreeably gone through, thou need not be in [unclear]leau[/unclear]

afraid of my uncle thinking he was slighted
for I am sure he never thought of it, he is not
a man to stand on ceremony. He seemed
much pleased with his visit and the attention,
of his Ballitore and Carlow friends.
[deletion]I say[/deletion] Thou hast of course hear of the wonderful
[deletion]I [unclear][/unclear][/deletion] Thou hast of course hear of the wonderful
interest thy annals excited, I cannot tell
thee how much we are obliged for them; I
observed thy directions to keep them private, and
shall return them safely by James. My father
was also much pleased with it. A. Wrightson
and J. Smith's letters which we shall also
send by James. We have heard from Thomas
lately that Frederick Smith had left the school
under his and Theodore's care while he was in Liverpool
about getting a head usher. Thomas did not
seem to like having such a weight of care on his
shoulders and was anxiously expecting his return
We have Jacob at home at present but I fear
we shall not long enjoy his company as he has
several places to visit ere he returns to America

which he purposed to do I believe about the
beginning of 4th month if [unclear][/unclear] which he
expects [deletion]for [/deletion]should arrive against then.
I am sure thy letter needs no apology, particularly
when considering the terms of friendship
on which we stand which I expect
will continue to increase. I am glad
that we have at last set Sally at liberty to
gratify you with a visit and hope she now
be as well pleased with Ballitore as [unclear][/unclear]
I was. As it is now my hour for going
to bed I shall conclude with dear love
to each individual of thy family and remain
thy ever affectionate
Hannah Fisher
