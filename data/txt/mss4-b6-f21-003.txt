My dear Eliz: I had no objection to thy staying in such
good company. Betsy told me that EL proposed coming, on
wch I wrote to him last night & requested he would not come
if his coming had any relation to the past affair. Ed: Allen
came here with 3 new scholars, he brings account that our dear
Ben is no better, much at one - Saml. gone home. I cannot help
indulging a little hope. I send Coelebs 2. vol. Deborah having
told me to-day the girls wanted it.
Deborah finely & with
Thy affte mother
