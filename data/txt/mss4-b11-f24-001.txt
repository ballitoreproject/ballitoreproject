Newtown 16th of 10th mo 1822
My dear mother
I received thy affectionate
letter and the cloth which I am m[insertion]u[/insertion]ch
obliged for, I was very glad to see my
aunt and my sister at aunt Courtney's
and I breakfasted with them.
I hope thou wilt come to see me at the
quarterly meeting I remain with
dear love to all at home thy affectionate
son
Joseph Clibborn.
