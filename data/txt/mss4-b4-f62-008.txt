My beloved sister Margt.
desired me to write to thee, – or said it would
be agreeable to thee to hear from me, – [underline]so because[/underline]
[underline]of this[/underline] I have [underline]longed[/underline] to set about writing
for indeed I would rejoice in doing anything
for thee that would afford thee [underline]any[/underline] satisfaction
– when thou art comfortable in thyself, thou
comforts all around thee, & I do wish from
my heart that peace & comfort may be thine,
& that thou may be preserved from slaveish
fear, that thou may put on strength in that
[underline]name[/underline] which thou hast [underline]rightly[/underline] advocated,
& [underline]refuse[/underline] to hearken to the bewildering
Enemy of our souls happiness, – I have been
very desirous, in my mind, that neither
thee or Betty Penrose may let in an
evel heart of unbelief as a poor weak
sister of yours has done, – but I expect
you will be quite different from me, for
Springmount: 1st of 2d mo: 92.

I hope [underline]I[/underline] was, or am, if honoured to be a vessel
atall, designed to be a very little one, – & I wish
to remember that a little sup out of a little
vessell may be spoiled & have a bad taste
if the vessell be not kept clean, – ay surely
it would be worse than if there was much.
Cousin Sally Grubb kindly wrote me a few
lines, & informed me of thy having no complaint
but one, – which [underline]at present[/underline] cannot be
helped. I have too a very acceptable letter
from dear M: Dudley; – wilt thou excuse
me to them both for not writing just
now. Tomorrow the womens meeting in
Cork, I think to leave this to finish
after it. We have got in spirits respecting
our dear S: Neale, hoping he is in a fair
way of recovering, tho' I suppose it will
be slowly.- this day was another [deletion] [unclear][/unclear][/deletion] [insertion]cut[/insertion]
made in his foot, – I wish it may be
the last there may be occasion for: – but
oh his patience is really admirable.

Fifth-day. Nothing very remarkable happened
this day, that I know of: the first meeting
silent: – some [underline]conversation[/underline] in the second
My dear E: Penrose charges me with
dear love to thee & Mother [unclear] illegible[/unclear]
In true dear & near affection I
rest thy own S: S in haste
Ask Sally Lees has she any thing
against Hannah Hiet? desire
her to send an answer to this query
