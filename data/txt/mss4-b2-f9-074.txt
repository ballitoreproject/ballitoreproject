Ballitore: 14/7 month 1785.

My dear cousin,

	Although I am not in thy debt in this way, yet as a free cover is going to your house, & some matter of agreeable intelligence has offered since my last, I am willing to give it thee -- A Letter which I have from London of 2d instant mentions that there is now in that city a person from Dantzick (or near it) in Poland, who calls himself a Friend -- says there are about six more of the profession -- they are subject to the King of Prussia, & enjoy several privileges, such as exemption from bearing arms, &c. -- he has had poor health for a few years, & has let in discouragement -- his errand to London is to consult friends respecting the propriety of his removing to England, having an inclination so to do -- I understand friends there discourage it, thinking that his continuing in his own country may promote the cause -- & that his leaving it might tend to scatter the few he would leave behind -- I suppose he intends returning soon -- My said Letter informs me also that they have in London an account contained in a letter from Nismes in the province of Languedoc, written by one person on behalf of about a hundred, who call themselves Quakers -- the letter is addressed to a friend Fox, who went to Paris, in order to refund some prize-money, which he had received during the war, & which became a burden to his mind -- (Its like thou may have heard of that transaction -- it was in the news-paper.) -- The letter, I am told, appears in an agreeable style, though not quite what we are used to -- as it was written in French, it may have suffered by the translation -- These people are not exempt from military service; but they have some indulgences, & look forward with hope for further toleration -- My correspondent adds, It looks as if something was stirring in the different nations -- the prospect of the principle spreading is comfortable -- I thought such information might be agreeable to thee, even though conveyed in my blundering manner. he also says, Nicholas Waln now in this city -- he has been at Norwich, where I understand he had very close service -- he, with John Storer, Thomas Colley & John Townsend have engaged their passage for America, & I expect will go in about 2 weeks.
	Thus, my dear cousin, having had this little piece of good news, while there is a good deal of a contrary nature handed about, I thought I would communicate it to thee -- though I am by no means very sanguine in my expectations about such matters -- However, whether men will receive, or reject this saving Principle, Truth is Truth, & remains unchangeable -- & the professors of it, who have been educated in the belief of it, & by birth-right (as it were) have inherited the privileges, & been made sensible of the power of it -- these have much to answer for. I heard from England that Hannah Bevington is improving finely in her health. I have not heard lately of Tommy Watson -- that place lies so cross for the port, that we can hear I think more expeditiously from London.
	Remember us all affectionately to all your family, & to all our friends, thou knowest them -- A Letter from Coalbrook-dale informs me that John Gough was about three weeks ago at Birmingham -- suppose ye may have heard of him since.
	I am, my dear cousin, with all our dear love to cousin Abby,
		very affectionately thine
			Richard Shackleton
