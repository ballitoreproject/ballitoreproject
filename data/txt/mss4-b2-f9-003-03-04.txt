Dear Cousin,
+++ A sudden change has lately happened in our family. My dear Mother, having come downstairs on the morning of 1st instant & was seized with the palsy, which distorted her mouth,  & deprived her much of the use of one side, & affected her speech & understanding. After some time her mouth returned much to its own position, & her reason & spirits speech were a good deal restored, so that she could (with some difficulty) converse with us to our great satisfaction. She was excee The passages of her swallowing were always very narrow; now she was [word crossed out] much troubled with phlegm, & could hardly let down the least drop of liquid food. Nevertheless she was exceedingly patient, easy in her spirit, & even pleasant in discourse; happ having (as Sam Neale said, who happened to come hither) nothing to do but to die. She did not seem to have any great deal of pain during her illness, but went off without any visible struggle between five & six in the afternoon of 4th instant in much quietness, peace & sweetness, which might be, & was felt. My dear child Peggy was present, & weeping much her mother spoke to her in order to comfort, but she told her mother they were not tears of sorrow but of joy; for at the instant of separation, her spirit seemed to [page number: 48]  ascend with that of her Grandmother to her new habitation, & she felt a joy inexpressible, which dissolved her into that tender frame. My poor father has had a [word crossed out] ^near^ pinch in parting with his old companion whom he had upwards of 40 years: but he knows the way to his own spring of consolation. ++++
thine affectionately
