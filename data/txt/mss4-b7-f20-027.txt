My dear Mrs Leadbeater I have sent the prints that I mentioned
to you, which you will of course shew to [underline]the Person[/underline] in question, and I
hope that they may aid the good lessons that he is continually receiving
from you, from Owen, and his other friends. You will now direct as
usual Wm Smith M P London - the Papers have probably announced
that the Election is safely over. I trust that your [unclear]town[/unclear] goes on prosperously
and that quiet and comfort prevail. It always affords us the sincerest
pleasure to hear this confirmed, and that the Welfare of Mrs Finn
and her Family still continues. Hoping that you and yours are well
I am with every wish for your happiness yours very truly
August 17 1826
