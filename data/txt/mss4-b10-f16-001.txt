Dublin 24th July 1820
My dear Eliza
I will tell you how your letter was received
I was received with great pleasure and satisfaction; with
pleasure as it is an event which so seldom occurs in my monotonous
life, and with satisfaction as it assured me that you
have not forgot me, and days long syne, and likewise that you
sometimes think of me and my Mornings walk to [unclear]Pill lance[/unclear]
which alas! I no longer take all that time, it being deferred 'till
evening, my time the forepart of the day being taken up with the shop.
I also beg leave to inform you that though you may have been the
first in deed, I am not so sure that you were the first in thought,
for I had begun a letter to you sometime ago, which I never finished,
and therefore you could not get it. Your regret for your lost time
cannot exceed mine; there is not a day passes in which I do not feel
the want of that knowledge which I might have acquired when I had
the opportunity. You wish to have an account of my pursuits, but my
time is so taken up with business that I can scarcely say I have an hour
to myself in which I am not liable to be interrupted by some call or
another, except it may be after ten or eleven O Clock at night, which
is not an hour that [insertion]a[/insertion] person will be in any great humour for studying
But I had better take care this is not an excuse for my want of

resolution in attaining that knowlidge, in which I am deficient
For it is this want of resolution which is the cause of all those persons
who have the means and opportunities of acquiring knowledge
being so ignorant; for there are few who have not the wish of knowing
as much as such a person when they hear anyone mentioned who is
celebrated for some acquirement; they may begin indeed very eager
to learn for a short time, but they soon begin to lag and at last drop
off entirely. You will say this [insertion]is[/insertion] all fine preaching, but what I have
attempted to describe just suits me. Our chemical Society has
fallen to the ground for want of time to attend properly to its welfare.
You regret that you had no party to Poula Phouca to meet some
of your Dublin friends there; I am in a fine humour to condole with
on your disappointment, for I am at the time I am writing this, regretting
not being with, and envying a party that are going to Luggelaw
to morrow Tuesday 25th July 1820. here follows a catalo[deletion]u[/deletion]gue
of the names of the persons who compose the party, to begin with the eldest
and end with the youngest.

Mother Edward Selina arthur, ) not Sure about the last.

25th It promises a fine day for the party to Luggellaw
I cannot inform you of any of the adventures they met with
untill I hear them myself. Edward and Richard were
talking of stopping there that night and going to explore part of the

County Wicklow which they have not seen the next day. I must
content myself with looking forward to that time when I hope
with diligence and [deletion][/deletion] [insertion]frugality[/insertion] we shall be independent of
business, and when we can can all enjoy such an excursion together
I must likewise inform you that T Stephens, F Malone, T Grubb,
Richard and I took a walk to Lugelaw from Dublin on Sunday
fortnight, we spent a very pleasant day [deletion][/deletion] in that charming spot
and came back again to the Sweet Smelling and Smoky Streets
of Dublin the same night.
I congratulate you on your happiness in having a situation
so much to your taste both with respect to [deletion]the[/deletion] [insertion]your[/insertion] employment
and to the desire which you have always felt for living in the country
[unclear][/unclear] do you ever get up to see the sunrise and what [unclear][/unclear]
you take or whether you ever take any, for I know you have not
such (handsome [insertion]2nd[/insertion]) views and (fine [insertion]1st[/insertion]) places to go to as you had whenever
you came out to Glendruid
I remain with unfeigned respect
Your truly T B. Junr.
PS. 26
All the party have come home E & R did not go that excursion
which they were talking about. I heard of no adventure worth mentioning
except that the Car which they borrowed from S Gamble broke down
when they got near home and some of the girls had to walk home across
the fields. All the forementioned names went except Arthur & Frederick
