Ballitore, 1st of 12th month 1758


        This is to inform thee & dear Father Watson that, this morning about Four oClock, my Wife was (through the Favour of kind Providence) safely delivered of a daughter, after a tolerably good & quick time. The mother & Child so far, as as well as to be expected. Sister Fuller & Aunt Boake were with her: they & their Families, I think, much as usual, except that Sister Fullers youngest has been much disordered with an Indisposition (they thought) affecting its [sic] Bowels; but was lately better. Cousin Molly recovering; her daughter Hannah recruiting out of the Measles & her son Jacky in them. The rest of our dear Friends here, I think, much as usual. Thy Grand-daughter & namesake very diligent at her Reading & Writing & behaves well.
        Our dear Love attends you all.
                I am, Dear Mother,
                        thy truly affectionate Son
                        Richard Shackleton
