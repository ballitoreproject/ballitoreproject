New York 2nd month 25th. 1820
My dear Friend
Some time since I received a
long & interesting Epistle, without either date or signature,
& had I been unacquainted with the hand writing
the circumstance might have given rise to various
conjectures; - but this latter, was too well known to me,
to cause even a momentary doubt, respecting the writer, -
I, therefore, feel no hesitation in directing to thee, the
reply, — fearing, however, that it will prove but a poor
return for the gratification I received. — The letter in
question was directed by my cousin Jas J Fisher & came
[unclear][/unclear] Ship Venus from London. - but I have not yet reconciled
to myself, the singularity of this channel. - Nevertheless
as it safely reached its destination, the particulars
of its journey are of no importance. -
I must thank thee for the quantity of domestic news
[unclear]which[/unclear] thou embodied in thy letter, & also for the copy
[unclear]of[/unclear] the beautiful lines on thy lamented brother, - who
is now above all human sorrows. - Imagination
[unclear]carried[/unclear]me back to the happy period of boyhood
when I formed one of your villagers, & could wishes
have reversed the order of time, the "citizen" of New-
york, would have [insertion]quickly[/insertion] changed into the school-boy of Ballitore!-
I could almost conceive myself returning from
a Nutting expedition to Narraghmore, or wandering
along the Griese towards the hospitable "Mill."- or
willingly accepting an invitation to a tea party at the

house of the "Poetess" , where I was certain to be delighted
with something original. - Recollections of this
kind frequently crowd in quick succession upon my
Memory, & do not subside without causing a temporary
emotion. - It is more then six years since I left
the "Classic Vale", yet I can refer to many scenes
as the occurrences of yesterday - & trust, they will
always continue fresh in my thoughts. -
I have not been favoured with a line
from my MD cousin "Tommy" since his removal
from Dublin, & presume he has become tired of his
trans-atlantic correspondent, as he never let me know,
where to address him. - I understand he at present
sojourns in Edinburgh, & I fear the [underline]coldness[/underline] of the
climate may have had its effect upon him. - Does
he serve you with the same irregularity? - if so,
I cannot complain. - My brother Joseph writes
in glowing terms of Scotland & its Inhabitants. - he
was enchanted with the Scenery about the Lakes, &
if he were a Poet, would no doubt have given vent
to his feelings in a proper sized volume. - I was much
interested with the article in the Edinburgh Review,
upon Campbell's new work, & regretted with the editors
that so little of his own composition [deletion]was[/deletion] [insertion]is[/insertion] displayed [insertion]in it.[/insertion]
I admire his poetry exceedingly & wonder he has not
drawn more largely upon a fund, which I should
believe inexhaustible. - I have heard that he Lectures
in Liverpool, upon the "[underline]science[/underline] -" & presume he commands
a large audience. - What a glowing

picture he gives of Pennsylvania in his "Gertrude." -
I have never visited the spot in which the scene of that
poem is laid, & cannot therefore, bear testimony to the
truth of his description. - but I expect the latter owes
much of its colouring to a fertile imagination. -
I travelled thro' some of the richest & best cultivated parts
of Pennsylvania, two years & half ago, & altho' I admired the
appearance of the Country, yet the boorish manners of
the farmers, who are principally of German & Dutch
extraction, perfectly disgusted me. - Their cattle, (as among
the peasantry in Ireland, but not from the same
cause) are served better than their children, & a
stranger generally takes the barns & stables to be the
family mansions. - Ignorance, & an instinctive desire
after money, have uncontrouled sway in their minds,
& provided the child evinces the latter characteristic
of the parent, he is considered as sufficiently skilled
in necessary Knowledge. - There are no less than 15
Newspapers published in the German language, throughout
that State.- Of course the above remarks
will only apply to particular districts. - Wherever
Members of our Society are numerous, the case is very
different. - Thou no doubt remembers Jessey Kersey. -
he met with an unpleasant accident some time ago,
but I am pleased to hear has nearly recovered - He
fell tho' a loft, with such violence, as to break his
jaw in two or three places. - this accident deprived
him of the use of speech for several weeks. - & the Meeting
to which he belonged, of his ministerial labours.
He attended the Yearly Meeting here in 1817, & I never

heard more persuasive eloquence, or natural oratory
than what fell from his lips during that visit. - In
his conversation he is extremely facinating, particularly
among young people, & possesses not a shadow of austerity
in his manners. - He had some distant idea
of visiting you once more. -
We have had an unusually severe
winter here, & more shipwrecks have occurred about
this Port, than for a number of years past. In many
instances, parts of the crews & passengers have been
drowned. One very valuable ship from India, went
on shore in a snow storm, near Sandy Hook, & soon
fell to pieces. - She had been 5 months on her voyage
& the connections of those on board were anxiously expecting
her arrival. - The Captain, supercargoes & several
of the sailors, met a watery grave, within 50 miles
of their homes. Another vessel was wrecked on
Long Island, & among those who perished were two young
Spanish gentlemen of fortune, who left home with the
intention of travelling thro' America for improvement
& amusement. - They were found locked in each
others arms, frozen to death in the rigging! - What
a dreadful shock, the intelligence of their untimely
fate, must cause to affectionate parents & friends
at home. - Yet do we not daily hear of as unexpected
calls to another world, without feeling anything
more than momentary surprise or grief. -
It is really an enigma, which no reason can solve
why we regard with apathy, these "memento mori"
that warn [underline]us[/underline] also, to stand prepared.-
