My dear Father

	This morning I received thy welcome letter, I had intended to have written to thee this day ere I received it, the Will is so often present with me, but how to perform I find difficult, having (I think) numerous cares, the preparation for the quarterly meeting lay heavy upon ^me^, as a Grasshopper is a burden often times to my weak mind, but my Husband, & kind sister Becky assisted me, & so I got thro pretty well, having a delicate infant at my Bre^a^st augmented the weight of my care: my sister Becky encreases daily (I think I may say) in my esteem & affection, acting towards me with a steady, sincere, unaffected friendship, she is not flashy, but substantial, & as the appearance of her friendship & regard does not shoot out at once, it takes root in the ground of sincerity, & produces fruit which is sound: my Mother has a pressing invitation to dine every day at Two-mile bridge, for the benefit of the air & exercise, which she mostly does & returns after tea, so that sometimes it seems as if she does not board with us, which thou knows must lighten my care on her account for a while, she is very feeble & weak in her limbs. & her appetite very bad. We were favoured with having the American friends our lodgers, they slept in our Chamber in one bed, & Jo Hatton, & Jo Nicholson (beautiful Youth!) in the other, Jenny Greer & Susy Jacob, Jimmy Abell & Richard Jacob occupied the Chambers two pair of stairs, & we had the pleasure of a share of our friends company in & out of the House, how pleasing is such freedom, my Heart is at times somewhat joyful that we can entertain our friends, & a desire is raised (tho in weakness) that the Master might have a place ^whereon^ to lay his head in our hearts, & his servants find peace in our dwelling. I delivered thy letter, which was enclosed to Jimmy Abell to John Pemberton, he desired his love to thee & Mother, & bid me say he received thy kind letter, as to the meeting I am not competent to judge of it, the Americans were concerned after a pretty long pause of silence. I was in hopes on our first sitting that we should be favoured with the breaking of the bread of life amongst us, but a cloud came over my mind, & remained so I think mostly all the sittings, at times perhaps a faint gleam of Sun shine was afforded, but I am not well satisfied with myself in a spiritual sense about this meeting, the Child was restless at night, & that might help to bring a heaviness over me, we lay in a bed we put up in the little room, having taken away the partition that divided the closet from it, which makes it on a pinch contain two beds: we were very desirous to have seen thee at this meeting, I was rather remarkably anxious for it at this time, but thou knew thy own business best. I am glad to hear you are all so well, I pity my Brother & sister about servants, when I am perplexed about them what must they be in their large family? but they are cleverer than I: thou asks me many questions, I am afraid I shall be foolishly minute, thou encourages me so to it, Abraham & Anne can read a little they continue to go to Becky Wade, on the smallest occasion ^of^ cold almost Abraham is very ill with head ache & feverishness, he remains quite delicate, Richard still wears petticoats & Sally trots about & chatters a deal, being pleasing to every one that sees her: & a great favourite with her Grandmother, who says she thinks there is not such a Child in the town, so sweet & engaging she calls her Mamma, & says How do Mamma, & pretty Mamma &c.
Nurse Bleach [?] is indeed exceedingly useful to me about the Children, & yet we are staggered in some things about the propriety of having her & her daughter in the House, several hints have been given us that her Husband & other child is provided out of our House, & yet people will not allow us to mention their names, nor will not bring any thing to the proof for fear of their displeasure as they say, I often observe things go very fast, as much meat is I think consumed in the Kitchen to what used to as if the addition of her daughter caused a much greater consumption, as also of bread, & other things lavished away & plates & various things not to be found; tho no acknowledgement of breaking them, which makes me fear they go under victuals from the House, how to suspect so seemingly ^a^ prudent, affectionate, attached Woman to me, under such obligations to me also, I cannot tell how to admit, but my Husband thinks they take from us, & I am distressed about it, I cannot tell whether envious people insinuate it, or not, & that someone close is the thief, but I was thinking of parting the Girl (her* daughter) & seeking for some young Woman, of stability (if such could be got) in her place ^(a friend)^, that would dine with the servants, & look after things being taken care of, as I have too large a family, & too many things upon me; to be capable of watching every thing is not in my power tho I endeavour greatly to do so. I should be very much obliged by your advice; & if my kind Mother could get me such an assistant I should be exceedingly obliged to her. I cannot charge Nurse with those things unless I could prove them on her, which I cannot do, & she would resent such an affront highly I suppose, without one could make it manifest that it was the case: & if she be clear how cruel would such a suspicion appears [sic], As to the Garden we have done a deal at it, ^we find^ it is very expensive; I have got the walks laid out 4 foot broad all round it & graveled, ^& box set at each side the middle walk, so to the gate^ trees nailed & pruned, the Artichokes all dug up, proving a poor little ordinary kind, & intending to set better plants in Spring. John says it spoils the Asparagus to dress it so soon, if I can get time, would set the tulips, we are now preparing to repair the Wall, having lime & sand drawn to the Hovel, to make mortar, I hope it will be done before the frost sets in: the Poplars are removed, & roses trees &c pruned & divided, bung [?] too large & strangling. Jemmy Daniel nor Molly Stokes neither received into unity, it is talked that Nathan Beely is an admirer of hers [sic] I believe Jemmy does not think of her in that way. Molly Dudley middling as usual her Boy lusty & stout. Molly Davis is still here ^very well^, the Doctor & wife were at our quarter meeting, as was dear Archy. Jonathan Dudley not arrived here yet. Thou must excuse the scribble of this, as I have been rocking the Cradle with one hand, whilst I wrote with the other. What do you think of those Northren [sic] resolutions & independent spirit? we fear hear it portends troubles similar to America. Jemmy Abell looks finely, I was comforted to ^see^ him so. I am obliged to thee for the intelligence concerning you all, which is always truly acceptable to me, my Husband joins in saluting every of you [sic] with near affection & duty to thee & Mother
	your affectionate daughter

Our dear love is to Nanny
how is poor Debby Watsons family? my kind love is to her & Cousin Abby Haughton. Is Hannah better? or Debby returned from Carlow?

* & yet, I know not what would become of the poor girl if I did; I wish I could find her & her Mother clear of these suspicions
