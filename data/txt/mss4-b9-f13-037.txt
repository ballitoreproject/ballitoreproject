Richmond 5th of 1st month 1829
My dearest Sarah
I have been longing to write to thee since thy
last relieving letter arrived, which felt to me as if it
removed a weight on my spirits, & gave them a spring I
could not feel while in suspence about my only niece's
life - thy daughter my dear sister must be next to my
own in my affections indeed, while she was in the awful
balance between life & death, [deletion]I[/deletion] left little difference in the
love I felt towards her than to that I felt for my own -
dear Maj I think this struggle has endeared thee very
much to me - I am longing to get a confirmation of the
good news. I was greatly occupied with company since
the merry season arrived - here the season of great visiting
& we had several days dinner companies, which really
consume a great deal of time - & to very little comfort or
satisfaction. - Did the time recall the memory of past
Christmasses. Ah! Sarah often on those days the very tears
could shew thee they were any thing but forgotten - but
my heart was rather low, thinking of your sorrow - & dreading
a storm was about to burst over your heads, & perhaps
that inclined me more to the dismals, as the retrospection
of old times is generally most pleasant to my mind.
but I could not think of our pleasant Carlow Meetings
& Fullers Court comfortable parlour radiant with its
wood fire & our pleasant faces, & our own "humble
home devoid of outward ornament, But the soft nest
of dear[unclear] cennutrial [/unclear] love & cordial friendship" as our
near mother calls it, without bitter, bitter tears, to think how
many are gone for ever - & how the rest are sattered about
far, far from each other "Ambition, absence, death have thinned
their numbers." how few - none of that social circle

that used to assemble donned either happy fireside
not one of that happy band was there this past time
Oh. Is enough to sadden the highest hearted yes oh
the invaluable treasure we have left - enough to make
our hearts bound with gratitude -
I could not send this letter by yesterdays post as
I was prevented from finishing it by a lazy morning
visit from little Doctor Harven, who snatched a 
few days from his [underline]patients[/underline] - or rather, from his
search for patients, to visit Eliza - he has had
some success already - entre vous, his brother John
told me he had received upwards of Â£30 that for
a beginning is not bad his is just the same [unclear]nice[/unclear]
little pusser her ever was not a lot expected by all
his travelling & all the attention & admiration
which has been & is showered on him. I had
a delightful letter from Eliza Barrington, which I
mean to reply to to Dublin as I owe Elizth letters
& I do not like to  direct to Ballitore until my
letter to her is sent- Eliza's letter was ended delightfully
it was old times revived & she besides writes so well
I could hardly tell thee how pleasant it was to receive
it - My love is to the mother & sisters I hope the
rest of thy young ones are well - & that thou wilt
keep them from seeing Margaret, beside their daughter they
might overpower, & so throw her back - or rather prevent
her getting on. How will Deborah be able to part Willie
My [unclear]fry[/unclear] are well - though Willie looks heavy & ill today

& his eyes cunning, so that whether it be his teeth or
the measles I know not - [unclear][/unclear] is very prevalent
here - but is generally favourable - still I am uneasy
for Sally has not had it yet & with [unclear][/unclear] up
people it is I believe often more severe. For the children
I hope I have not more to dread than the disorder
as they are so stout - Ah! when shall I have the
[unclear][/unclear] of introducing them all to thee -
thou still unknown to thee - I am sure thou
would dote on little girls. -  
Poor Abby FIsher & her little girl have gone back to reside
with her father Capt. Brown - I went to see them - & such
a place & such people I never saw. - Castle [unclear]Macksent[/unclear]
in the Castle [unclear]Macksent[/unclear] we knew, Mullamast was a palace 
towards Bridgetown. I never saw the like - & such inhabitants!!! 
I wonder how my uncle could wed one of the
family - but that is all over - his little Marry is a lovely
sweet little creature. I could help [unclear][/unclear] to take 
her pain such uncles & aunts
I had an extremely pleasant
cheerful letter from Debs who
is much better i understand - it was quite [unclear][/unclear]
please give my love to Eliza [unclear][/unclear] - her mother, [unclear][/unclear]
has become a mender of our Book Society & is
very pleasant - he is now quite well. 
I am now hurried, for my letter ought to be
in town. My aunt [unclear]Aaney[/unclear] bade me order
for her a box of each sort of candles, the same
as I got. -  & I want one of your smallest boxes
of soap. - In great haste I am dearest Sarah
Ever thine L J Fisher
Give my dear love to Edward I felt much 
for him & [unclear]nice[/unclear] joyful sent him my
congratulations [unclear]Sally[/unclear] love to you
