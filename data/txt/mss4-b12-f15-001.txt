[ ELIZA HENRY ]
My ever dear friend
Your most saddening
remembrance did my very
heart good - and though
little able to write, as yet,
must inflict on you my
[underline]scrawling[/underline] thanks.
You just said it, my dear
Eliza, new friends, I thought
very dear, can never waken
the sweet dreams of this
past - can never give them

eyes to peer into the stream
of [insertion]our[/insertion] memory searching
for the pebbles so precious
even still to the old.
I dont think any waves
of time's current can
ever efface the recollection
of the delght with which I
heard the [deletion]sighs[/deletion] whispering
of the wind in the trees
of the Glen the first morning
I wakened in the cottage
The Wind, the summer
wind just telling its story
to the trees alone &
going no farther off
with its music!
"Oh days of our youth! -
sometimes I am tempted
to say with Burns
"Thou glorious time [deletion][/deletion]
"Of youthful prime
"why comest then not again"
and then I think - if I had
all these tears to shed
over again & all the heart
burnings to [unclear]undress[/unclear] would
I ask for my vanished youth.
Dear Eliza I did feel
much for you [unclear]for the[/unclear]
 [insertion]bereaved[/insertion] family when I heard

of dear Lucy's death -
Time had begun to make
you feel accustomed to
your grief [unclear][/unclear] I heard of it
even then it gave me
a great shock & trouble.
Oh she must be a sore loss
to her family & to your sister
heart. - I was grieved also
to hear of your accident
thus confessing [deletion]to[/deletion] your
[unclear][/unclear] limbs to "[unclear]deviance[/unclear]" -
but I hope you do
not suffer much pain, &
that you will soon be able
to walk [underline]with a stick[/underline] like
your old friend. May this
year be a happy one to
you in its course & not being

any more domestic trials.
To you, my early &
dear friend, I have
first written
the new name
to Time .
Give my
kindest
regards to
your Thos,
& also to
The Dr &
dear Cathrin
Your respful Lydia

Abby Henson was much gratified by your
remembrance
of her &
desires
her love,
