Richmond 16th of 1824
My dearest Sarah
I have just heard of an opportunity
- - 25th,, - The opportunity passed before
I could avail myself of it - but here is another, & I can
only give thee half a sheet for I have almost exhausted
myself - not my mental powers - oh! no they are inexhaustible)
writing to Edward & Eliza. - We never scarcely
hear from any of you either in England or Ireland
I was delighted to day to hear a young man say, he saw
my sister in Dublin - he is a son of John Mark's &
a total stranger to thee - however at last I found
out that he was shown thee leaning on Edward in
the street & told that thou wert my sister, & the gentleman
thy husband - that was all, - I was provoked.
I want to hear of bonny Meg -& I want to hear of thyself
I hope thou had not to pay double for my contrivance
letter. - I will enclose another bit least thou should
not have discovered that. - I wish you would write
to me. - I have all my work done I may say I could not
tell thee all Sally has assisted - & I might make a summer's
day seem short telling thee what a sweet companion
& kind sister she is to me. My father did not like
our leaving him so of course we staid. Enter dinner
I have very little time to say more. Answer me about
the yarn. I want thee to buy for Sally & me

4 yards of net - two for each - I suppose that which might
cost 4/-5/-or 6/- per yard. & also please to send me
as much pretty neat bordered lace as would trim or
border rather two caps. I expect my mother about
the middle of next month. Tell me about Margaret
& her progress & tell me particularly of thy
health. - I beg thou wilt write by post - for oppertunities
are marvellously scarce. I am rejoiced
they have got a nurse for Lydia Sarah, & now I
hope she will live. Farewell my dear Sarah
thine very afftely [unclear]LJJ.[/unclear]
