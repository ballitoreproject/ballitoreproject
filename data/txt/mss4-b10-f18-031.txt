Queenstown July 14th 58
On board Norma -
My dear Mamma
I intended to have
written you a line yesterday, but
the ship was so unsteady owing
to wind & tide being strong, that
I could not write - we are
all quite well & are after taking
a delightful peep at Killarney
(which I will tell you all about
when we meet) which I expect
& hope will be very soon, as
this is the last day of the

Regatta, and I think we will
leave this to-morrow or next
day, but of course that will
depend upon the wind &
weather - I cannot write
more at present as I want
to send this on shore by
a boat that is going,
hoping you are all quite
well believe me your much
attached MJB -
[underline]We all[/underline] send our love to
[underline]you all[/underline] -
