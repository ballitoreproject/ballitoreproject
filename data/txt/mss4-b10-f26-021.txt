April 19th 1847 Lintz
My dearest Mother
I wrote to you last from Vienna this day week which letter will
[insertion]nearly a week previous[/insertion]
one also posted from Prague I hope you have duly received - we have been in such a
whirl ever since this day week that I had not time to write more than what is
is in the scrap to Elizth nor could I have posted one if I had written it - as we always wish
to put our letters in the office ourselves lest in giving them to porters or waiters they might
not be sent at all - I shall now as well as I can recollect give you a sketch of what we
have been doing since in Es letter I have come to Lambach we there engaged a carriage to
take us to Gmunden by the train road & to stop on the way long enough to give us time to walk
to see the Falls of the Traun river - the road lay as far as that through a thick wood all along
the edges of which was thick with flowers the first I may say we have seen from my
wild - mezereon - two kinds of Christmas Rose - red & white - blue & white wood Anemonies like what
we have at home & another larger kind that I have seen in our nursery gardens in some spots
the grown was blue with our single blue Hepatica - besides there were sweet violets & [insertion]in a few places[/insertion] wild violets
in many - it took us a full hour to walk to the falls, see it, & return to the carriage - and we soon
got in to open ground again and had a fine view of the mountains in bright sunshine & [insertion]then[/insertion] snow
clad sides & tops looked beautiful - the country through which we now passed had more the appearance
of a gentlemans demesne than any thing else - the cottages so neat & nice with [insertion]bright green[/insertion] grass growing
up to the very walls the field & hills dotted with large clumps of trees principally spruce fir and
looking as if the greatest care was taken of them - numbers of people at work on the fields with broad
straw Hats & light clothing as if summer were already come - indeed the heat of the sun and
brilliant appearance of every thing would have made you think it was - we got to Gmunden
about two oclock & found the Steamer was to start at three for Ebensee at the other end of
the Traun lake which lake is nearly encircled with mountains the chief of which is the Traunstein
 but there is no use in my attempting to describe it if Rich has Murrays hand book of Southern
Germany you will find it all there well described - from Ebensee (which is a most, I think
I may say the most romantic town we had been in) the road winds [deletion][/deletion] [insertion]along[/insertion] the close alley
through wh the river Traun runs - the mountains towering almost perpendicularly above us
most of the way - it was a delightful drive [deletion][/deletion] we travelled in a carriage holding four
there was awaiting our landing a kind of Omnibus into which we got first but when it
was found that there were only four persons we were transferred into a smaller one, our
travelling companion was a respectable woman but not what is usually denomenated
a Lady - her luggage & everything about her indicated she was in comfortable circumstances
 for her [unclear]Ecuch[/unclear] of life - she wore on her head a helmet shaped cap made of some Gilt
material - with a single bow of black on the top - you would call it a golden Helmet and

tho it is said to be the costume of the peasantry of the neighbourhood we did not see
many of them nor can the poorer sort afford to wear them I suppose for on seeing number
of them for sale in the Market Square at Lintz we enquired the price & the very cheapest
would be about 33/- of our money - I understand they hand them down from one generation
to another - so much for the Golden Helmets We got to Ischl before it was quite dark but
too late to walk about so we had tea etc etc and went to bed - the next morning we were
up pretty early & had breakfast and then walked about the town and had a good deal
to do before we got a conveyance to get forward on our journey to Salzburg - we did so at
last & left Ischl & all its romantic & beautiful scenery about [deletion][/deletion][insertion] 1/2 past one[/insertion] oclock the morning and
so far in the day was beautiful but we had not got very far on our journey when
we saw there was a change coming on - the mountains [deletion][/deletion][insertion] becoming[/insertion] cloud capt and
the day overeall at length it began to rain, about three the Lohnkutscher stopped to feed
his horses at a humble but picturesque Inn on the border of the Wolfsgang Lake it
was in appearance [deletion]in[/deletion] [insertion]the[/insertion] swiss cottage style - we alighted as we were to be an hour there
 and entered the house and were shown into the public room (a very large one) smelling
so strong of smoking & feeling so close from the heat of the stove that it was almost
overpowering and the first sensation made one think they could not bear it many
minutes - we had no alternative for it now rained heavily - there were feature wooden
seats round two sides of the room - five tables with chairs about them - scattered about
the room when we entered were the mistress & three servants seated at their spinning
wheels all merely at work the mistress laid hers immediately aside & came forward to meet
and welcome us & enquired what we should like to have & we ordered coffee as the most likely
to be found palateable - one of the maids a very pretty girl was dispatched to get it for us and
did so very quickly - in the interim an immense Dog which had been lying at the house
door when we arrived entered and also gave us welcome by coming to us wagging his tail
and pressing up against us our attention could not fail to be drawn towards him for
his remarkable size and apparent gentleness - he was of the mastiff kind I think - he seemed
the pet of the household but particularly of his mistress [insertion]who[/insertion] talked to him & fondled him as if
he were her child - Whilst we were at coffee at one table several men [insertion]a dozen perhaps[/insertion] at various time
entered and seated themselves at the other tables calling for what ever they chose in the way
of eating & drinking - the Host himself arrived to and welcoming us seated himself at
one of the tables amongst the men he had Beer bought to him [insertion]too[/insertion] and talked and joked with
his customers as if he were not man of the house - the spinning wheels went on at
every spare moment of either mistress or maids and all together the scene was an
amusing one & being rather out of the common way made it still more so -
the time came for our proceeding on our route - but the rain turned to snow - and
snow it did the entire way to Saltzburg allowing us to see only odd glimpses of
the mountains - the part we were immediately passing through we could only see so as
to know it was fine & in many parts grand the road running along under very
high cliffs & It was dark night when we arrived in Saltzburg we got very

comfortable accommodation at I forget what Hotel and taking tea & supper together went
to bed and were again astir pretty early in the morning and found it still snowing
but not lying on the streets - we were a little puzzled what was best to be done - we wished
we had planned before hand to go farther into the mountains - we breakfasted and the snow
ceasing & clouds breaking our hopes began to revive we went out to see the town and
walking up to one of the heights over it - (see Murray) - the day still improving we fixed
to proceed and as we were crossing the bridge were accosted by a man who proved
to be another Lohnkutscher (who had got a hint about our wanting one I suppose from the one
we had had the day before) - the weather promising better we engaged him to start at one
 oclock for Berthesgaden & back to Salzburg next day by Reichenhal we had not got
on very far on our journey when the snow came on again - but still our hopes were
sanguine that at this time of year it would not continue besides we should pay for
the carriage whether we went on or not so on we went and down the snow came
so that the distant views were quite hidden from us and the mountains all cloud
cape - We arrived at Berthsegaden in pretty good time but the ground was too wet to go
out & it still snowed so that every thing had the appearance of the depth of winter here
they told us that it was quite an unexpected change for the weather had been like summer
until the day but one before and we could tell if this was the case by what we had observed
in the progress vegetation had made in the fields and flowers [deletion]tho'[/deletion] not so much in the trees for
tho' their buds were in many places ready to burst forth we saw none in leaf except [unclear][/unclear]
 and Gooseberry - the next morning it was still snowing - but it stopped occasionally
and [insertion]we[/insertion] had some glimpses of mountain scenery - we saw Unterberg to the top we passed
under it - but a still higher one would not deign to let us have a glimpse of him
except his base - we went to Keonigsee hoping to be able to get on the Lake but the snow
falling very fast we thought it better not to venture in an open boat as we had
not sufficient change of clothes if we got wet - we could see enough to tell us we had
lost much by the unfavorable weather - we retraced our steps to the Inn which
we had left in the morning & whilst the Kutscher fed [insertion]his[/insertion] horses we visited the Depot
of carved wood & which contains much worth looking at to coax the money out
of peoples pockets - we were not much tempted because the bother there is not
only the carriage home (which is the least part of it) but the searching & duty we one have
to from passing through so many different states - we got off again and proceeded to Reichenhall
where we dined - there was much to see here if we had time & the weather permitted - but
as neither answered we only staid an hour - the snow now only fell occasionally and
tho' the clouds did not go away they were not so low - we passed through some magnificent
scenery - the fine pine forests backed by the stupendous mountains rising
in some place [deletion][/deletion] almost perpendicularly - the trees with every branch & spray hung with
snow (as we sometimes see it in Ireland for an hour or so when the snow falls without wind) were
beyond description beautiful - I could not help shedding tears it was so new so grand I had never
seen anything like it - nor I suppose never shall again - for who would go travel for pleasure
[underline]purposely[/underline] in such weather - no description would do justice to it at all I must therefore leave it

[unclear]Be sure[/unclear] give my dear love to all as if named - I need ask no questions because you
cannot answer them until I go house - I would be glad you would enclose this letter
to Olivia to read when you have read it & any other of my own family that would
wish to read it - she would I think like to know something about our movements
 and both Jho & Mary are lazy about writing - Elizth & [unclear]ah[/unclear] might so too - Olivia will send
them back safely & quickly I am sure if you just send her a line to that effect - It is
exceedingly hard to write when she is posting about at such a rate - I have not hope
a single note of my journey except what I put in my letters which I fear are full
of incoherences & mistakes from being always written in such a hurry -
farewell my dear Mother & believe me as ever your affectionate daughter
EH
Thos and Mary desire their love to you and to Ballievey also
The day we left Salisbury whilst travelling it was the first part of the journey it was freezing and so cold
that my veil was frozen quite stiff and Thos breath was in hoar frost on the breast of his coat - I had to
make a paper mask for myself with only eye holes in it & fix it up under my bonnet & tie it down
under my chin - I was the middle person in the seat & it so happened that the fold wind came on
me more than T & E & or Mary but my [unclear]winterware[/unclear] did admirably and afforded us some laughing
 after all this when we got to Lambeth in the evening it looked gay & [unclear]smiling &[/unclear] with us when we left it

April 21st half past six we have passed the
Valhalla & have seen the Spires of Ratisbon
but the Danube winds so much in its course
that I know not if we will be there this 1/2 hour

demur it was done & having taken a cup of coffee we started on the tram road - some time after it was
dark we were alarmed by loud shouting and then a shock and we found we had come in collusion
with another carriage - wich was either meeting us or going the same way had stopped we could not find
out however no injury had been done I suppose as we soon got on our way again - We went on then till we
came to the Barrier where we had a good deal of delay for the person who watched it I suppose was asleep and
such knocking and shouting as there was before he would be got up so as to let us pass then he I suppose in spite
for being araigned insisted on searching our luggage - without a light to see what he was doing and I do not know
how it would have been managed had not one of the passengers happened to have a box of matches & [unclear][/unclear] a light
he got nothing contraband & after while we were let pass - where we got to [unclear]L?mbach[/unclear] it was midnight and we had
to rouse up the Hotel to let us in & get beds ready - we were excessingly tired and right glad to get into beds which were
most comfortable in every way - we found the Steam packet had not start until Tuesday so we had a day
to lie by & did not therefore get up until 9 oclock - after breakfast I sat down to write this, but
came to the Barrier where we had a good deal of delay for the person who watched it I suppose was asleep and
had to lay it aside in order to
go out & see about our passports -
and taking our places in the
steam boat - after that we
walked to a high hill over
the town of Lintz on which
is a convent & a chapel
and from which there is
a much finer view than
from the hill we ascended
the first day we were here
It was market day and
great numbers of people
were out and the Market
stalls full of merchandize of
every thing you could imagine
we went to bed early as we
were to be up at three oclock
to be on board at four in
the morning - April 21st
we were on board in due
time and had a fine day
and very pretty scenery
along the Danube as far
as Passau which is a
very curious picturesque
town - we only passed it
at least we did not land
but let some passengers in
& out & we stopt at some
town farther on about
9 oclock and had to go on
shore to sleep but were
on board again at four
this morning - we hope to arrive
at Ratisbon this evening &
to have this ready to post - this
is the most inconveniant
disagreeable Steamer I ever was
on board of and I shall be
right glad when we are out
of it - indeed I am longing
so to hear from home that
it takes from my enjoyment
and had I thought we should
have been so long out of the
way of doing so I would not
have consented to it -

We got back again to Saltzburg late at night had supper and went to bed to be up at three oclock
to start at four by [unclear]Filivagen[/unclear] for Lambach to meet the rail road there for Lintz she did start exact
to the hour in the front seat of the machine which held three so tightly [unclear]hached[/unclear] we could scarcely stir and
we were anxious to be away toward home- it was a most rickety affair - every joint in me moved I think
at every jolt- [unclear][/unclear] at is your words would that they would think of sending such a wretched vehicle on a journey
of 12 hours [unclear][/unclear] (but to us it was 14) the Snow & rain had ceased and was followed by a hard frost - the roads
were dry from it when we set out the pools of water covered with ice & icicles [unclear][/unclear] from hours [unclear][/unclear]
but there was not very much Snow on the roads at first - but it appeared and they began to get
very heavy and drifted in many places so that our journey was retarded so much that we of 12 hours [unclear][/unclear] (but to us it was 14) the Snow & rain had ceased and was followed by a hard frost - the [unclear][/unclear]
two hours late arriving at Lambach consequently the train was fine - there happened to be three or four other
[unclear]horsemen[/unclear] as anxious to get on as [unclear][/unclear] so we applied to have an extra coach sent well us and after some
