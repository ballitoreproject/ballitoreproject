You my Dear Madam - you judge
most justly of me - I ever retain thy [unclear]remarkable[/unclear]
a Cordial respect for thee - whose superior worth
has taught me to Value. - And [unclear]Esteem[/unclear] them - And
you Madam were one who held that realm
my breast - long Ere I had the pleasure of seeing you,
and within this last month I have thought of you
more frequently than Ever in Consequence of my
reading a book which I believe you are the author
of - When Mrs. Chambers was here, I read your
College dialogues - she told me you had [deletion][/deletion] some
others in the same stile - and Chance I am certain
threw one of them in my bag lately - dialogues between
Jenny and her grandmother - it is indeed a most
excellent work. - in it we find [unclear]Consent[/unclear]Ideas - deep reflection
and extensive knowledge - [unclear]dealvd[/unclear] in a beautiful [unclear][/unclear]
garb... and so justly aranged as to call forth the
interest and feelings of Every upright heart - whispering
to it - [underline]to go And do likewise[/underline]
I dare say you have read the
Cottagers of Glenburny - I have read it twice, with
great pleasure - and have wished it was printed
in the stile lately adoped for the Lower order - at
the humble price of 4d Each Volume -
[1822]
I have

been three years labouring with the Just - you
were told of - which but for the indolence, and
I fear I may say [underline]depravity[/underline] of the Attornay, wou'd
have been Concluded in one year - but in defiance
of all his delays -- and schemes to Counteract no -
it was brought to a point about fourteen months
since - thro the exertions of a short worthy man -
Mr. Dwyar - one of the six clerks - and it was
agreed by all parties, that it shoud be settled by
arbitration - on our side Counceller Adore - brother
in Law Dr Mr Dwyer was to be Arbitrator -- and on
the other side a Lawyer - Chosen by them selves
with an umpire - if necessary --- this was
agreed on upwards of a year since - And by
Various pretences on the part of our attorney
delay'd - at last I have resolved on Changing
the Attorney - and I have hope of getting
this tedious business settled in the course of
this summer - if the poor woman obtains
justice - She will have £150 a year while the
Lasses last - which will be only about ten years -
And at least seven or eight hundred pounds arrear
of rent - She and her family are now living by
plain work and washing - and sometimes without
work or washing to do. The ground of the

suit is simply as follows - Mrs: McDermot to
whom the property belonged - got into some defaults
and an arrears of rent - [unclear]insured[/unclear] - amounting to
[underline]£109: 0: 0: [/underline]- to Mrs Tindal - ground Landlady to part
of the property - (Mrs. Tindal is in opulence - mother
to Aldeman Tindal -) her head rent was £80 yearly.
She served Ejectments - and Mrs. Mr. Desmot - a very
ignorant poor woman who kept a carmens Stage
or Carmans Inn - offered to Mortgage the premises
and allow Mrs Tindal to receive the rents - fee
she has paid - this Mortgage was made in 1814 -
The profit rent is [underline]£150[/underline] - this base woman
Mrs. Tindal has contrived to hold the whole
property some time - in consequence of which
poor Mrs Dermott was broke - And put into the
Marshalsea. Where she would have showed
but for me - and in the End died of a broken
heart _ her Daughter - a widow with
four Children became Heir to the property -
I had got this worthless attorney to engage in the
suit - before the mothers death - he had
to renew it, in the Daughters name - and got
her made a pauper - and, but for the improper
conduct of our Attorney - the suit would have been
concluded in a year -
when we get it

Concluded - I shall inform you how it has
Ended -
As I know you are ever doing
good - I suppose you have some injured
person in View - whom you woud wish to
recommend to the same attorney -
if our new one does his duty - I will
then introduce you my Dr Madam - or those
you wish to serve - But God knows whether
he will bet as he should or not - for
attorneys are persons on whom - we can
have but little reliance - they are [underline]legal [/underline]
Robbers -
I beg my Dr: Madam you will
present my best respects to Miss Ladbeater
and remember me also to the Miss Shakletons,
as I constantly make inquiries about my
much respected aquaintances in Ballatore, when
I see Mrs: Chambers - I have learnd from her
that one of your Daughters is married, but
I believe it is not the one I have had the
pleasure of seeing, I wish her happiness-
I have just been reading - the [unclear]striped[/unclear]
letter I have wrote to you - but find is sa
