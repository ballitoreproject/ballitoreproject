here- We had but a small table
at dinner time, Ned did not
even come out - every thing [unclear]seemed[/unclear]
to go contrary. - for Mama insted
of settling with Grandmama
to have Fanny, settled with her
to come over for her and dine
with us on second day, so
all our plans were knocked
on the head. but we cannot
always have our own way.
8[insertion]th[/insertion],, Papa went in this morning
and so I had to content myself
with not going in, and writing
a letter instead. explaining
matters to Polly - who I find was
much disappointed. Fanny
and I went out. I walk - our
last walk, to see Jem Byrnes's new
last walk, to see Fern Byrnes's new
house and home by the plantation
