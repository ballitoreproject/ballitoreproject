My Dear Friend
as I happend to be in Mt. Melick on
seconday what came to my hands frm Peter widdows
but a letter from my good natur'd M Shackleton did
not it manifest the truth of it when she thought of
such a worthless creature as I in this remote corner of
the Earth, surrounded with many things weakness of one
sort or other but what have I to disturb me, a terrable
thing the enemy of my own house that I believe is determined
never to let me along whilst I have a being [unclear]Sure[/unclear] I often
think of what the appostle says about the messenger of
Sattan I believe he is the dreadfullest ever to come of an errand
for he seems as if he wou'd never be satisfied for when
he gains his point in one thing he must or will look
for another thing & another he wont take his errand and
go of like one possessed with civility & gratitude but he
still keeps lurking abut the house like an evil spie
to try which part of it is the weakest & watch an opportunity
perhaps in the night season or when one was

off the watch to get in & plunder the house spoil the
goods oh he is a desperate wretch I think I may call him
for he makes no distinction now adays between male or
female that I have such a dislike to him that I often
wish to have such a barr on every window & corner of my
house that he might not have the smallest place to peep
in much less to get thro I think I may say I am almost
always affraid he will break in some where or other for my
house seems weakening & likely I believe to mould away
I believe the walls of it is made of some sort of clay & that
is apt to moulder away in a short time, & thou says I get
a pain in the hinder part of it & a great cold but I am sure
I never got it by riding nell doyle but I got it by wet and
by being doorkeeper & therefore I did not keep the door for [unclear]nough[/unclear]
My dear Molly excuse for what I have wrote I had not the
smallest Intention of it when I began but I was not well pleas'd
with thee for making appoligies for what the call troubling
me but I call it none it was quite conveinent for me to make
enquiry about the Eringo roots which I did at the places thou
desired but cou'd hear nothing about them & it was as conveinent
for me to buy the Worsted if it does not please send it

back & they will change it - I am well pleas'd to hear that little lovely Child
Ebenzer is likely to be spared a little longer to his parents & if it was consistent
with the divine will I shou'd be pleased to hear the rest was well over it, but
it is a favour they belong to such parents that I trust will submit in [unclear][/unclear]
a passive resignation too the will of him that gives & has a right to take in
his own pure time I wish them to be favourd with the Influence of that
Comfort that comes form him that is the comforter of his people when they
may be able to say not my will but thine be done, my dear love to them and
to Dear Sally I wish her a prosperous Journey also to H & S Haughton my
very Dear love to Father & brother & accept of the same from thy sincere
please present my dear love to little peggy &c.
my dear love to A Connoughty
M Hudson & the other young
Woman I forget her Name
farewell remember there is no one to see this besides thyself
