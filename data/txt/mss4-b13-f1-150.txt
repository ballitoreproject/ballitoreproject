148 Third-morning the wind a little more favourable, yet not fair: - We went to meeting, where Sarah had good service: & toward the concludion [sic] of the meeting, after strugglings of spirit, gave up to repeat part of what she had mentioned on first day afternoon, even her earnest desire that the rich might remember the poor. In the evening several friends too tea at our lodging, after which retirement, & S:T engaged both in testimony & prayer. After supper again she had some encouraging expressions to drop, I observed she toss’d & tumbled in the morning early, & I believe something new arose: wch. was to have a meeting with friends servants, if possible before the time of our sailing: a few collected, or rather two, viz: Jonas Stott & Molly Bewley at Saml.’s, where after a good deal of consideration & consultation, it was agree’d to have it at 11 o’clock at Sycamore-ally: - but before this Sarah wished to visit Richd.
