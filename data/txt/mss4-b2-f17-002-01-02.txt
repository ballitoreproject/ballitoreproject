From the same to the same

Ballitore: 10/3 month 1786
I have been just now again perusing my dear friend Mary Dudleys letter, received by her husbands hand at Mountmelick, with renewed satisfaction, I am glad that the chain of religious love & friendship is come to be thus brightened between us by this kind of intercourse. I am glad that my intimate friends & near connexions are thine also, & I trust that our fellowship is not only with one another, but in degree with that which consecrates our union. I believe thy dear husband would carry home to thee a pleasing account of our meeting there  like a good spy, he likes to make an encouraging report of the land. + + + I was disappointed of seeing meeting that dear child E.P. at Mountmelick. I was disappointed again of having her here. We seem as if we must be satisfied, some of us, to converse together in this manner. Thou & she, who are a couple of invalids, may complain to one another  may you also at times rejoice together, & not be too backward in telling to one another & to your fellows in the right fellowship, your experiences of the Lords tender dealings with you, of his mercies & of his judgments. ++++ [pencil note] x Poor Peggy - thou & she have been separated for a season  ye both of you look at times as though you were oppressed with family  cares, & + + + I wish your tranquillity & even the interruption of your tranquillity to be sanctified to you; that all may (ferment) work together for good. Sometimes matters arise so dark, so difficult, & perplexing, that we may be ready to say, this is not of the Lord  he is not in this whirl-wind- yet his hand though unseen is there - & is there in the good of his [page number] 256own children & people, whose eye is steadily fixed on him through all & over all - he orders, or permits the tempest; but he limits its force  he is not only in the sunshine & the calm; but he maketh the clouds his chariot, & walketh upon the wings of the wind: And as if this were a preparatory dispensation, & what follows was consequential; the sweet Psalmist immediately adds, he maketh his angels spirits: his ministers a flaming fire. + + + +
	Farewell, my beloved friend! Accept to thyself, & share with thy husband the hearty salutations of me & mine. Thou hast long had my best wishes for thy preservation & increase in every good; & they are at this time fervent, sincere, and new.
