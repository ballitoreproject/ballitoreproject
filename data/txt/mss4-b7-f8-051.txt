Waterford 19 March 1801
I have been highly gratified by my dear Cousin Mary's
communications & hope the exertions used in the production of
the last were of no disservice & that thy health & strength are
re-established. I apprehend although there may have been
no failure of care & attention there has been too much eagerness
on thy part to resume thy wonted function as even after
so many relapses 12 days only had passed away - our women
here are in general more cautious — I know mine bulky as
she is & stout as she may appear has not been enabled to
use such expedition — She is scarcely for any continuance
free from pains & aches — our little family remains in status
quo no increase only in magnitude — the sudden appearance
of a mouse has been sufficient to prevent an addition to
the number — which is large enough according to the
exigency of the times. Eliza grows big & coarse, Sally is
delicate & Mary has much the appearance of health — the small
pox has not since been among us — we dread its approaches
Mary Kelly has not visited us as often as I could have
wished

wished: she exhibited a melancholy picture of scenes
once delightful I should be highly gratified by
retracing the recollection of former days & hope the undertaking
will be prosecuted I am not without expectation
of having it in my power one day of spending a
little time in Ballitore & perusing the narrative. The nature
of my employment is something changed so that I have
in a measure command of my time. Francis the eldest son
of my late patron sometime since informed me that it
was the advice of his Friends that they should endeavour
to contract the expenses of the business as much as possible
& part with me or my fellow labourer at his option —
therefore as my department keeping the Accounts might
be filled up by himself he preferred retaining the other
who was experienced in the arts of buying & selling:
I heard the news with satisfaction as from the very great
decrease in the value of money I found it impossible
to subsist without overwhelming myself in debt & judging
that no single person or mercantile Company would like
to advance Salary enough I determined to offer my
services to [unclear]men[/unclear] & to portion out my time as most
convenient to myself — merely to keep their Accounts

adjusted & to be paid by each according as my time
was occupied or my value estimated — by this mode
I hope to keep the wolf from the door — I need not
have much idle time on my hands — I pay a daily visit
to each if necessary & have hitherto given satisfaction to
those who employ me as I hope if health be spared to
continue to do — My former establishment still continues
as to emolument — my advantage is in the appropriation
of my time. Cousin Abraham did not find
himself at liberty to come to spend any
time with me when last in Waterford
he called only at the door with his horse
by the bridle just going to set off about some business
to the country — a day or two after appeared our old
Friend John Elsey on whose mind old times have made
a very deep impression — he regretted much not having
seen AS & spoke in affectionate terms of the family
He is an Officer in the Nottingham Fencibles & was
returning to England on the recruiting service. He is
married a second time (I think in Wales) has two or three
children & expected to meet a stranger at home. My dear
love attends you all Becca joins me in best wishes: Let me hear
soon from thee as I am anxious about thy situation WRayner

I had forgot to say any thing about Edwd Miles
thy recommendation would certainly have weight had
I the ability of doing him any service I consulted
with Pat Rogers who joined me in [unclear]opinion[/unclear]
that he had no chance of success here in the [unclear]time[/unclear]
of life he was desirous of embarking in — as there
were more applications for employment than vacancies
the pressure of the times increasing the number of
candidates & occasioning those in place to cling much
closer to their establishments. I have an old Book
belonging to my Cousin — [unclear]Bypres[/unclear] Art of Poetry
which I had an intention of sending by Mary
but it is in deshabille part of the cover being
separated from the back Bypres[/unclear] Art of Poetry The book binder disappointed
me who promised to put it in travelling
trim so I reserve it for another opportunity
Present me affectionately to thy Wm my Aunt —
Cousin Sally, Abrm Lydia & family & to Athy folk
when opportunity shall serve.
