Clonmel 1st month 25th 1783

My dear Uncle

Thy kind sympathizing letter came to hand in an acceptable time it does not seem in my power fully to acknowledge it & yet gratitude calls upon me to make a true confession to my (what shall I say) Father Confessor? I have now put on about two weeks longer in this place have received very affectionate kindness & great hospitality from my friends  were there not something in our minds thats panting after superior & more extensive & more secret enjoyments I have thought myself placed amongst the cordials of life; but without the seasoning virtue of truth & an [?] evidence though ever so small ^of^ divine approbation marking or resting upon our dwelling place they are tasteless & insipid enjoyments  perhaps I have deprived myself of that which is good & am now too ready to let them share the blame; a disposition I wish not to cultivate for it is highly inconsistent with the benevolence of the Gospel ^which^ breathes no inferior language to that of glory to God on high peace on earth & goodwill towards men but how to distinguish at times the grand cause amongst a multiplicity of causes, requires wisdom, undefiled wisdom, that the immortal birth may be surrendered to the breast & the care of its true mother, that nothing hurt it or diminish its strength, but that under all turnings & overturnings, divisions & subdivisions it may gradually & steadily grow in stature, in wisdom & pure understanding to take to itself an ever lasting dominion in us  Its ^the^ deep that calls unto deep  I thought I felt on reading thy last letter something of the mind of truth in reviving a little my drooping spirits, a degree of thankfulness covered my mind & I was encouraged to wait the passing away of this gloomy ^night^ in comfortable hope of the dawning of a better day wherein the former & the latter rain may descend to add sap to the root & to refresh the branches
What is it in us that flinches so much at suffering? it must be that flesh & blood which can never inherit the Kingdom  I have bestowed some pains to silence it with reasoning & arguing the nature of things when alas I have sorrowfully found it fed thereby & perceived that its ^only^ in humbly abiding under the divine operations that subjection is wrought & most so when the 
cause was not fully ^discovered^ for then the lower petition ascends which at this Time covers my spirit grant me a grain of the precious gift of faith that I may live & walk thereby
	There was a visit to be performed the fore end of this week to friends or their families at Youghal  notwithstanding much being said to me on the occasion & what is still more a view I thought I had of it before ever I heard such a visit was intended, I did not find my way open to accompany them [word crossed out] ^now^ & therefore declined going to the place at all, though my attachment to poor M. Dudley who thought she had felt the weight of it likewise, seemed almost sufficient to urge me, as she laid great stress on my going, & knowing her disposition & that she had hurt herself by past unfaithfulness brought me into a difficult situation  I looked at it on every side  I considered the supreme ability ^& faithfulness^ of her ^great^ Master who had called her from time to time to come into the vineyard & work  I saw how little the affectionate part in me could help her & I dreaded taking my flight in the winter season; on this occasion the coming forth of the three children out of the fiery furnace occured [sic] to ^me^ with a degree of encouragement that the smell of fire was not upon their garment  the allusion I leave to thy superior judgment  however poor Molly ^& Robert^ went, found R. Valentine & E. Statton there, the former was willing to accompany the latter but said he felt no concern to the visit  Molly got very low thought all things out of join on 1st day which was their mens meeting, & in the evening received an account of their son ^William^ having been seized with a paralytick stroke about a quarter of an hour after they had left home, but that he was recovered, notwithstanding which she left the friends without sitting one family with ^them^ & came home on 2d day has kept her bed ever since 3d day night, having took a violent cole in her return  we have heard no more about the visit but there seems some thing mysterious in it  R. Valentine has requested our staying till after Cork quarterly meeting when he thinks of going directly for Whitehaven  in consideration of his company we have concluded to lengthen our visit here; as to going to Cork we have not fixed but it looks very probable we shall  I look at no gratification in it but I cannot trace an objection to a good origin  I therefore beg to be enabled to follow the leadings or directions of that voice which says this is the way &c though it lies through a thorny suffering path  I did not tell ^thee when^ mentioning Youghal that E. Edwards was there on 1st day & appeared in supplication in the evening  There must be in my dear friend & Uncle a spirit of great condescension & fatherly kindness or I could not thus freely address thee & like a child of thy own tell thee all my whys & wherefores  thy familiarity renders my visit to this Land more comfortable & more like being in my own fathers house to which on occurrences befalling me here I have not that access as to thine, because they have not that knowledge of minute circumstances attending me which aids sympathy & assists in counsel  nor would I like to trouble them with what they ^can^ do no good nor put any good in  I had a long letter from my dear mother last 2d day she says that at the Quarterly meeting at Leeds was *that cheif [sic] apostle among many others ) S. Taylor, Patty Routh, G Marriot, John Wigham, Matthew Johnson, [illegible] & William Rathbone  the meeting was uncommonly large & much favored ^not only^ with strength & clearness to point out why the head is such but remedies & there was not only openness to receive but a hope that the day is dawning in which corruption will get a little more removed & the sound gather strength  we had cause for thankfulness  many of us returned from it unexpectedly refreshed for my own part I had that most comfortable station of sitting by & seeing the work well done without much nay very little active part therein  few of the little craft went out only our Henry & Betsy Hoylands trumpets sounded & seemed to draw 
the cheifs [sic] to war their appearances were excellent bearing the comparison like apples of gold in pictures of silver  so much of my dear mothers letter I thought would not be unacceptable to thee  to hear that the battle goes well abroad is cause of as much joy as if we were immediately partakers of the spoil when we find that it is to the Cause of the battle our hearts are bound  I am now my dear Sister Peggys Guest  Robert is gone to Waterford to spend a day or two the friends are visitting [sic] families ^there^  Molly ^Watson^ has got a fine girl & likely to do well  my dear love attends Aunt & cousins & with the salutation of near affection I subscribe myself thy very obliged friend & neice [sic] S Grubb
7th day evening  My R. G. is returned from Waterford he staid the mens meeting there  Ruth & Ann were pretty well have near finished their visit & intend for Cork next week  Sister Peggy desires her dear love  she is in fine health & spirits as is her Husband & little family  Robert desires his love to thee & Cousins
