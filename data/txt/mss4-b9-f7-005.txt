My dear Elizabeth
I write to tell you
that Sarah is tolerably well after having
with a very short illness, given birth to
son. She has been in tears here these few
days past wanting the event, and I much
rejoiced that [insertion]the[/insertion] hour lost [unclear][/unclear], I hope, likely
to lose so little of the country enjoyments
of Kingstown; where we expect she will very
soon be able to return. She was much
pleased to hear from you of Betsy L. gradual
recovery, in such cases they say, there
is much less danger of a relapse. I have
been wishing to see you all once more in
Ballitore, and hope with summer over
to have that pleasure. Sarah will soon
should matter go on as they promise now
be able to tell you all about herself and
babe, I shall leave such news till then and
conclude with the request that you will inform
Eben & Debh. of your having read this acct. I
Answered

am half ashamed to write a formal [unclear]notice[/unclear]
to Eben, it is so very short a period since
I did so before. Give our love to my
Father and believe me your's affectionately
