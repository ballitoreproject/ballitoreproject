I received My dear sister's long, entertaining, agreeable,
affectionate letter, it is indeed unreasonable to expect thou could write
much, it is pleasing that thy servants answer so well I believe it is
a good deal in the power of masters and mistresses to make good servants.
I am more and more convinced of the propriety of treating them well,
they are our fellow-creatures, it is alone to the bounty of Providence [insertion]we are indebted[/insertion]
[deletion]that we are[/deletion] [insertion]for being[/insertion] in a little higher station, the scale might soon turn if
it was His pleasure and I think a tru[deletion]e[/deletion]ly religous mind could
not behave with haughtiness to those inferiour to them. I am
sensible thou art quite clear of this as also my brother Sam, I am
only conversing with freedom; a very proper consideration for me
now, I could wish to get a thorough good one, if I enter into housekeeping,
which appears probable, I wish to be properly frugal at the
first setting off & yet not to be meanly so, if I can not assist much
I hope not to hinder, I have at times, according to my small
ability, wished to be enabled to be a proper helpmeet to one very
much my superiour in every respect; and I have been favoured with
a

a degree of faith that my desires were heard - the good wishes of
my friends have been a great consolation, but such extreme weakness
of spirits I never experienced, I hope my stomach is gaining strength
my eyes still remain[deletion]s[/deletion] so weak that I can scarce bear the heat
of the sun - Frank [insertion]Johnson[/insertion] tells me this weather is very unfavourable,
strongly recommends riding out I rode a good deal till under
the necessity of discontinuing it by a boil: it is rather trying now when
I have some additional work to do, to have my eyes so affected, but
I think to leave my fine work for a future day. Samuel Neale
ought to permit Molly to let us know how she is: many here
long for her return, yet we should be sorry to deprive her of the
pleasure her sensibility causes her to reap in the company of her
friends. My dear father's partiality and affection for his children
naturally leads him to wish to hear often from them. I pitied him
much, to be burdened with me when I was [insertion]ill abroad[/insertion] - I know my stomach
was weak before I left home, yet I believe I should have in great
measure escaped this illness, if I had not got cold in Bristol: but
getting it, it flew to the weak part. C Hustler Phebe Marshall
and John Consin were at meeting here yesterday, & felt our great
weakness

weakness and poverty, and the deficiency that reigned amongst us in
not digging deep enough for the water of life: they are gone and some
of our family to Athy: we expect their return to night and Betty
Gregory to meet them here. My sister Lydia has held up finely,
she has been a little ailing lately, but I hope is recruiting: she got the
pills: Polly in Dublin: she is I think a frank, open, sincere girl, and
very good-natured: propensity to dress appears her ruling passion, perhaps
that passion may be overruled: we have all some weakness to combat
with, happy for us if we be sensible of the beam that is in our
own eyes, & not so ready to perceive the mote in our brother's. Our dear
little Richard, to our great joy, has got a tooth: and the bold chap made
his nurse pay for his acquisition: we hope another will soon make
its appearance: he is a lovely fellow, I wish thou could see him; I
am glad thou anticipates us a visit - I hope against my unknown
nephew Richard (to whom my heart warms) is weaned, our house
if I may then call it [underline]our's[/underline] may be in readiness for thy
reception. My brother Samuel intending us the favour of his
company sooner is a gratification. I am such a jealous-pated girl
that I believe I could scarce banish that passion, if he was absent
without very good cause. Betty Gatchell is new here, she longs to see [insertion]thee[/insertion]
perhaps when thou comes, we may take a trip to Mt. Melick.
Tommy

Tommy told me cousin Abby and Peggy Christy were planning a tour
to Munster: I did not hear when they intended setting off - I think cousin
Abby looks better than some time ago; if the weather was something
cooler I doubt not but the journey might be good for her. Poor Betty
Malone! it is natural her friends should catch any flattering symptoms
& even to hope against hope; but it appears most probable she
is journeying to another country. Our cousin Abby Boake seems
comfortably setted at [unclear]Prospect[/unclear]. Ben has the appearance of a very
loving, delighted husband: sweet Jenny there still, Poor Hannah's
holding out seems admirable, and is a fresh instance to the innumerably
ones we have daily of the great kindness of Providence: her disposition
seems much changed: love and resignation seem[deletion]eth[/deletion] to attend her, Susy
is also very loving, she loves to be bustling about, we heard poor
Betty Fuller that was had been ill, I think danger of a miscarriage
was hinted: it is said he is very loving [insertion]to her:[/insertion] the foundation for domestick
comfort did not appear to be laid: the approbation of ones friends and
near connections is tru[deletion]e[/deletion]ly comfortable: we know not when dear
Jenny will return to us - my aunt acted very genteely by Abby.
We are pleased to hear Molly Dudley gets on so well, were concerned
to hear her sweet little infant had a disagreeable ailment in her jaw:
please to inform us how she is in thy next, I hope our agreeable,
helpful fellow-traveller is well. I had a very friendly letter from my
Abby she
