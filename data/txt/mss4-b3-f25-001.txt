London September 5th 1754


Dear Cousin


        I suppose you are Surprised that I never wrote to you since I had the pleasure of seeing you at Ballitore, & own my self very remiss in not doing so; as a free confession of a Fault deserves Pity, do rely on your good nature to forgive the Omission. You may Remember as I was going to Dublin told you of a Scheme I had of setting up in the County of Gallway [sic], my Friends in Dublin did not approve of it, therefore went back to Ennis & lived half a Year with an Apothecary, after which went to Limerick & lived there two Years with another Apothecary, but not finding it Advantagious [sic] to Continue any longer in Ireland, in the Station of a Journeyman, sett [sic] out for London the 10th of June last by the way of Cork, Bristow &c. As I happened to come over in the worst season of the Year for our Business, the Nobility & Gentry being mostly out of Town was three Weeks before I coud [sic] get into Employment, & then was under the necessity of Engaging with Messieurs Brouncker & Atkinson Apothecaries in the Strand for 10 Gueneas [sic] a Year with Diet & Lodging, if I had not done so perhaps might have continued a good while before woud [sic] find out another vacancy, however hope when am better acquainted to hear of Something more Advantagious, & so shift my Quarters.
I hope all your Family are well, please to Remember my Love to them all. I woud be Glad to hear from you & revive a Correspondence that has layn so long Dormant, if I can be of any service to you here, hope youll not hesitate to Commission me, as I will Execute it with pleasure. I should have mentioned before, that I met with some Relations here that were very Civill [sic] to me, with one of whom I Dieted while out of Business. 
When every you are pleased to favour me with a few Lines, Please to direct to me at Mr. Mathew [sic] Alanson, Jewellers at the Sign of the Ring & Pearl in Long Acre London.
        I am Dear Cousin
                Your most Sincere
                        & Affectionate
                                Kindsman [sic]
                        Nathaniel Shackleton
