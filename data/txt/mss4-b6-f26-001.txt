[1 June, 1788]
My Brother Grubb having set out this morning to meet my sister; requested
me to take some charge of his house & children till their return, & having a
house to myself, I have sought for a quiet apartment wherein to write a few lines, this
apartment has happened to be the very one in which thou slept when first in Clonmel,
& the vicissitudes which have befallen thy life in that short time naturally occur to my
mind, filling it with admiration & sometimes impressing it with awe. I received thy
letter just as I arrived from Youghall, a good deal fatigued with my journey; how
pleasant a cordial is then the remembrance of a friend! thy letter was so, yet it has
caused thy friend Anne Grubb & myself some anxiety since on thy account, & it is by
her encouraging me that I write again soon[deletion]n[/deletion]er than I thought I should, because we
wish to know how thou fares now, & have no other mode of enquiring we think: yet
I hope thou believes we do not wish to draw thee out into communications which in
thy low state of body & mind might be injurious, for in thy own words "we really wish
"thee well". O that thy winter may be now past, if it pleases him who orders all things
aright, for I fear thou art too low, neglects proper attention to thy health, & as the Body
sympathizes so with the mind, thine must now want additional support. I have
wished to be able to sympathize with thee, but I believe I know not what true sympathy
is. I may imagine sometimes I mourn with the afflicted, & I think I desire to
bear part of their burden, believing such a weight might have profitable effect on my
mind; but it is not such an one as me who can offer sympathy or comfort. However
I hope it would do no harm to write again, believing it will be agreeable to thee to
hear of the welfare of thy friends here, who all I believe, with myself, are favoured
with health, & every outward enjoyment to all appearance, except dear Betsy Grubb who
sometimes is not very well, & her worthy Aunt Taylor, in whose peaceful chamber
a pleasant retreat is often found, though one seldom, if ever, finds any thing in
that happy mansion annoying, to retire from. Thou wilt excuse me I believe for
saying, that thy saying so much about the [underline]supposed[/underline] trouble thou gave me by
desiring the account of the meeting, rather hurt me; perhaps thou did not
think

think that it was a pleasure to me [deletion]perhaps[/deletion] as great to write it, as it gave thee
to read - as to thy sending a verbal request, it never once entered my head about
any other - so do [insertion]not[/insertion] by such trifles increase thy burdens - Thou, however pleased me
greatly by telling me none knew of my letter, & also by thy very friendly caution,
which I was before convinced of the necessity of, & hope I practised it - but think
not this conviction arose from the reasons thou gives - No, really - If I ever have cause
to think differently of thee from what I do at present, the upbraiding thou
mentions would be the least of my concern - but I am not afraid of thee, especially
since thou fears so for thyself. I had written to Anstis before I receed thine, have
not yet had a line from her since I came. I told thee I was at Youghall -
I had a wish to go there, my Brother lent me a good horse & I rode single; My Anne
G: behind her father, other friends in company - the weather had just set in hot,
& the great hills made the journey more tiresome, but we bore it very well, were
more tired returning, at least I was; but one night's rest put all sensations of fatigue
to flight, & indeed they mattered little, for I believe it was good to be there. I am
afraid to speak much of those favours which I am so undeserving of, but I hope
I felt a degree of thankfulness as well as wonder for the sweet quietude which in
the general clothed my mind, & the tenderness which sometimes melted my heart.
It was indeed to me a memorable time, & had I been more attentive to these impressions,
I might perhaps not be now so much bereft of these favours. I was at the places
where thou had visited with me, yet was never enquired of for thee but once, that
was by Susy Lechy, the young woman who accompanied us in a walk. It affected
me with grief & surprize to see that fine, sprightly girl, pale, emaciated &
much deprived of the use of her limbs by a long & painful illness, from which I
hope she is recovering. I spent as much time as I could with her & her company
was very pleasant. Edwd. Hatton, J Garratt, Mary Moore Josa. White & his sister Hannah
& Thos. Taverner all exercised their ministerial gifts. One evening in a meeting
at a friend's house, how beautiful was it to hear Edward Hatton, in awful supplication
pray for "our Beloveds from this Province whom thou hast sent into a strange land"
frequently & fervently praying, "Be with them," & for their preservation & safe return
Then

Then with love & humility beyond expression, he added, "Be with thy poor elders, as
"well as with thy Ministers & with thy overseers."
I am a little troubled about this letter since I wrote the above, Betsy Grubb so much disapproves
of my [deletion]sending[/deletion] writing; [deletion]chiefly[/deletion] [insertion]one reason[/insertion] because she thinks thou would rather I should
not, from what thou said in thy letter; now we carried on the argument with some
spirit - but I hope without any ill-humour, & finding we could not convince each other we
dropt it - but it has made me thoughtful whether I may not add to thy burdens, while
my real intent was a little to amuse thee, & I hope thou wilt, with thy wanted candour, say
whether she is in the right, or whether I mistook thee, for I think thou would be pleased to
hear from me if I could write with ease to my own mind - tho' I do not feel uneasy at writing
I may not be the tip in the wrong for that. Poor Nancy began to wish I had not said she
encouraged me - had I thought it wrong I would not - neither perhaps did [insertion]she encourage me[/insertion], but I imagined it.
We got letters from A Sparkes this evening, are much pleased with her account of thee, & that
[unclear][/unclear] hast had Wm. Beale for a companion. I believe I should have not have [insertion]written[/insertion] so [unclear]much[/unclear]
[unclear]without[/unclear] given thee a little account of our little contest, & were I not willing to [unclear][/unclear] I
[unclear][/unclear] letter worth something by giving the latest account from our friends on this
continent, R: Dudley having got a letter to-day which he has promised us [unclear][/unclear]
of to-morrow - therefore I do not intend to conclude this till then.
The last date of Mary Dudley's letter is the 12th from Bern. She & her companions are
preserved pretty well in health, but often low & deprest in mind - They were nearly a week in
Basle in Swisserland, & seem to have good service in that place. One day in a large company of
Moravians they (our friends) were led into silence, wch. was a thing strange to the people, yet was
felt I suppose by one man, who asked them in English, should he desire the rest to be still, to
which they acceded, & a remarkable meeting ensued, wherein she thought some minds were
answered, who were inquiring "What is Truth." They have been recommended by the religious
inhabitants of one place to those in another. In some places more openness is afforded
than in others. Women's preaching is strange & hard to go down sometimes. Travelling
they are obliged to eat in publick at ordinaries, unless they act, & pay as Nobility, & often
musick plays during the time of dinner. The men sitting with their hats on, & refusing
to pay the musicians, & the women's appearance also makes them gazing stocks, yet
are treated civilly. I am sorry I can not give thee some extracts - but I only heard
the letter read, it breathes the spirit of faithfulness, tho' one may perceive the marks of
conflict too. I hope ere now they have joined the men from England. a young Moravian
an Englishman has been very helpful to them as Interpreter. Now do not be uneasy
at the little dispute wch I informed thee of above; we began & ended in love, & it was
that only made my friend disapprove of my writing; she is jealous I believe I should
make my letters cheap (for she values them too much) she is jealous I should do what
she thinks appears to thee improper - she uses other arguments yet more weighty with
me

me, & wch agree with my own sentiments, & I do not like to persist in my own opinion in
opposition to the counsel of a friend - yet I believe I shall send this since it is written. Had
I believed thou wert well & cheerful I should not soon, if at all, have written I believe - but
having too much reason to fear thou art neither, I have done this. Nancy's love to thee -
Betty loves thee too, tho' she sends no message of it by M: S: Clonmel : 1/6 mo: 1788.
