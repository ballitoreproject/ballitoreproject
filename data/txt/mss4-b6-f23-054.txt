To Jane Burke,
from M:S, with a collection of her verses.
O, Lady of the sweetest bowers,
May thy mild eyes propitious view
My muse collect the lowly flowers,
Which in her humble valley grew!
Wild though the flowers, the vale is sweet,
To thy lov'd Lord the vale is known,
Her echoes still his name repeat,
And still she claims him for her own.
'Twas in her groves that science fair
Reveal'd to him her sacred store,
She boasts her Burke, & cries, "Who dare
Dispute this palm with Ballitore?"
Nor

Nor powers, nor fame this favor'd shade
Could bid his generous soul despise,
And when the muse her tribute paid,
He view'd it with indulgent eyes.
Embolden'd thus again she lays
Low at thy feet her rustick fame;
For simple nature's fond essays
The friend of nature will not blame
