7th.. Thursday - I went to town to pay
a few visits and get somethings
Called to see Aunt Liddy and found
Nannie just going out, so She and I came
to town together where I had paid my
visit a [underline]very[/underline] long one - I shall not
forget this day, such going about as
we had to find Bessie P whom
I wanted to see very much and at
last we [underline]did[/underline] meet at Aunt Cole's.
The four of us, Ellen being the fourth
went about together and I afterward
accompanied Bessie to Miss Holland's
where I dined - and came out
by 5 1/2 train with Papa and Ned.
[deletion]1[/deletion]9th Saturday. We were expecting Avy
out this evening, but he did not come
by the early train and was not therefore
in time to accompany Charlie
who came out with Ned Grubb Avy's
schoolfellow - His father and mother
and sister Louisa are in town at
present -
