B Pike went away before second meeting
so we had only James & Joe to tea -
chess and back gammon amused us
after it.
5th..- After breakfast the two remaining
visiters went off to Muck amore I think.
We all walked in the glen and
then Margt. and I went to dinner to
Anne Wakefields, where we met the
two Elizabeth Greers -, Jane and John
Grubb Richardson who did not stay to
tea, and Anne Wakefield's sister [unclear]Mary[/unclear]
I think. She was telling me about
Mamma with whom she was acquainted
when they were both young girls.
This was a very interesting topic to me
and I quite took a fancy to M. [unclear]Moor[/unclear]
she was so cheerful and pleasant.
Charles Wakefield was very entertaining
too he told us several amusing and
some remarkable anecdotes - the latter
were about Samuel Emlin. [deletion]one was[/deletion]
