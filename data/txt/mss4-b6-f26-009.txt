Dublin 3d of 2d month 1791.
I was much gratified by my dear Wm's kind & affectionate letter,
it felt very cordial to my heart; I now attempt at a sort of acknowledgment,
being not situated rightly for it; we are at Wm Alexander's, have
just drank tea, & conversation is now going on , which generally puzzles
me; I could hardly write to any one else I think thus circumstanced.
My poor mother & thee may think actions speak louder than words,
when I express my sympathy for her encumbered situation, & yet I do
not hasten to relieve it: my dear, thy kind desire to have me take the
satisfaction of my visit makes one easier; it is like making myself of
much more consequence than I am, to talk of so many engagements,
& fear of offending kind friends; but really I know not what to do about
these visits, which however I am getting thro' as well as I can. This day
Mo & E: Dawson took me to their country-house, where we breakfasted &
dined; it is a very pretty place, & they are very friendly to me, & I much at
my ease with the old people. Last evening we spent with dear Rachel
Jackson, she began to tell us of a poor woman in distress, the circumstances
were melancholy, but Rachel was not asking relief for her, our little Susanna
was with us, she listened to the tale; she had earned by marking
stockings 3 1/2d, & as they were done had no prospect of more, out of this [underline]all[/underline]
she produced 2d, which she gave for the relief of the poor woman, & would
fain have given her whole substance. I was charmed with the beautiful
buds

buds of virtue, & forebore not to say so - they said I might spoil Susanna,
Susanna remarked, or rather enquired, if one strove against being spoiled
would it not help to prevent it. When we went up to bed Susanna was
not asleep, she called, "Mary Leadbeater" - I went to her she put her arm
round my neck - "I would be obliged to thee, said she, not to be praising
"me, or calling me thy Pet, for I have a [underline]strong suspicion[/underline] it would spoil
"me." I am amazed at her sometimes, & feel a great love for this dear
child; does she speak a word which perhaps she [underline]feels[/underline] in a wrong spirit,
she is ready to ask forgiveness for it - I much desire she may go [insertion]on[/insertion] & prosper.
She is under excellent tuition indeed, & so is the more sensible her faults
lie at her own door. John Walker took upon him most of the commissions,
seems at a loss about the locks, & is to bring me some account
this evening about them to send home. I hope we may forward [insertion]some of[/insertion] the things
by the carrier. The dear children I am thoughtful about, hope they
may be favoured to get well through, it is comfortable that little Thot
Chandlee is recovering. I did hear of Jo Haughton's courting scheme on
our wedding-day, but as it was told me in confidence I did not tell any
one not even thee, my beloved, but I know thou wilt not be displeased
with me for it, at least I believe so, for I was charged not to tell, & it was
not a matter that concerned either of us. Besure tell me what coloured
silk thou would like, for I am bent on knitting thee a purse, & Suzy has
been working out a motto for me - she & Molly desire their love to thee, &
all the family; E: Alexander desires her's, & little Susanna in a whisper
desires her [underline]dear[/underline] love to thee.
J:

John Walker has just come to tell me that good locks can be made by
his father for 4s..4d apiece, slighter he believes could be got for less, but
fears they would not be so suitable - therefore I desired he might get them
put in hand, they will not be large, but good he says - the beam for the
scales I suppose will be longer than the dimensions Mother mentioned,
such length as he spoke of being by no means proportioned to what it
is designed to do, J: W: says. And [insertion]now[/insertion] farewell dearly, give my dear love
to Mother & all the rest. I lent R: Grubb's letter to Joseph Williams as
he has not sent it back [insertion]yet[/insertion] I think perhaps he may write & enclose it.
Dear Joseph Williams, may I remember his ministration to me yesterday!
Farewell again, my dearest Wm, take care of thy precious health, I
continue very well, &
thy truly affectionate
Mary Leadbeater.
My Dear William we are much obliged by thy so kindly permitting thy
Mary to stay her own time with us, which I fear will not be much longer, as
she has now a tie extraordinary at Ballitore, she is well in health, takes I think
pro[deletion]p[/deletion]per care of herself, & is so very agreeable that I know not how we shall part
with her, talks of thee with the affection of a dutiful Wife - I shall be obliged
to thee to hand the inclosed letter to Abram [underline]thyself[/underline], & please keep Sally's
till she comes home, or if opportunity offers thou may send it to her -
I wish thou could make it convenient to come [insertion](but not too soon)[/insertion] for Molly & then I can tell
thee more of her pretty behaviour, but not how much thou hast obliged thy
Friend Susanna Bewley

Wm Leadbeater
Ballitore.
