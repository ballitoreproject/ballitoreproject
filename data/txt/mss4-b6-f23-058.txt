& the different books which are read.
I found there was a lending library
under the care of the master
he also showed me the accounts
of the books [deletion]read[/deletion] borrowed &
returned - all so regular that
you cant imagine my pleasure
I saw that something could be
well done in Ireland
B - How did you like the
mistress's department ?
R - Indeed I dont like to say
much about that - certainly there
was a great deficiency in regularity
but I expect girls schools will be
much improved by the present
plan of educating mistresses
The girls were however very decent
I have it from good authority
that a certain nameless [insertion]insect[/insertion] animal
is scarcely ever seen in a school
of 170, which were daily observed

that a certain nameless insect
how once dared to show himself
on the very top of Miss's bonnet
I meant thy aunt's honey - she is a bee - thou wants honey -
Ballytogher
is scarcely &c &c &c
in the year 1801 amongst 12 or 20
girls - this is a contemptible
illustration, but it is to me
an undeniable & satisfactory
proof of [deletion][/deletion] improvement
I have written all sorts of
stuff as it tumbled into my
head, which thou will take
or leave as seemeth the
good -
There ought to be something
said of the Pestalozzi exercises
but I forgot & dont know how
