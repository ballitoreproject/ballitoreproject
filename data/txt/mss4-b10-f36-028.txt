first day 8th mo 4th 1833
[underline]hour: time to go to bed[/underline] (Glendruid
My dear Eliza
I doubt not ere this thou hast thought
me very lazy for not writing, indeed I intended
doing so before, but still put it off not being sure of
any opportunity, Frank however says he intends going
 on third day and he will take this. I thought he had
no mind to come see us at all, he staid so long
not coming out untill sixth day evening when he
and Edward came just [insertion]in time[/insertion] as we were at tea having Jos
& Sally & two friends of the name of Newsome sisters
to Sam Newsome. Frank slept with us having occupied
thy room & E at Richard's I ought to go
back & tell thee what we did of note since thou
left us. That evening with the Gambles, we drank
tea next evening at the [unclear]Parade[/unclear] viz., My Mother
Patty & I, and R&E also little R, we walked down
after tea to look at the railroad, and indeed
they are getting on very fast at it it would worth
while going to look at it when the men are at
work, there were some at it when we were there
tho' it was nearly dark. Betty Franklin desired
 her love to thee & Lucy when I wrote I hope it is not
the worse for the length of time I have had it
in keeping. well on first day we had all

the Allens that could come & J&M Wright. R&E
were here to tea from the Cottage & Edward & Johnny
rode out from town so thou may suppose the
little parlour was pretty full. there was a great
clearing out before we went to bed. On second day
we settled to go on our first pic-nic party so
my Mother Patty, Nannie & Emmy in our car &
R & E & little R with Mary & Florence in their car
& myself riding set off, (Arthur would not be bothered
coming of course, so we did as well as we could without
him which was [underline]very well[/underline].) to Kilmacannick
turned up the new road there & dined up on
the side of Sugarloaf from which we had a glorious
view we spent a very pleasant day dined
on one of the despised geese which R said was
excellent & which we all did justice to. we got
a great scorching it being one of the hottest of days,
we were home to tea. The children were very good
and Emy seemed to enjoy it highly & had quite
an appetite for her dinner. I suppose Frank has
told thee that Nanny is gone she & Mary had a
falling out so she came into the parlour & told
my Mother she was [underline]going home[/underline] and did not
even give my Mother time to ask her why,
she has told a great many lies, said that Mary
wanted to get her daughter here in her place

also that Mary got my Mother to write to Darley to turn
away his dray-man, & that the tea she got here was
little better than ditch water. she did not allow
Maurice to sit at the beakfast table, indeed I observed
latterly that he did not come in till they were done
or if he did sat by himself at another table, so there
is a fine lady. I am very glad she is gone except
for one thing & that is my Mother being obliged to
have the care of her at night, Ann minds her
when she has time during the day. she is very
well again and her cap is th[insertion]r[/insertion]own off without
her getting any cold. I have told thee up to
sixth day all the things of any note
which have happened so now I will
take a jump to First day, tho I forgot
my Aunt & Mary came out to
us yesterday the both desire there love to thee
& Lucy and tell Lucy my Aunt sent her a particular
love and a pair of little stockings for the hopeful
son, and that she did not think that in [underline]so short[/underline]
a time she could miss her [underline]so much[/underline] as she [underline]does[/underline]
Mary bid me tell thee that she is here & that
she is the same unromantic thing as ever, well
I am come to today in my history we went to meeting
where we met Frank and brought him home
not to dine with us but with R & E who had Aunt Jane
SH & SM. also H Allen we had John & Martha
& spent our day much as usual. I have not asked

thee yet one question about yourselves, you are
doubtless very busy, and still have a great deal to do
I hope thou may not be the worse for it. I am glad
thou went down with Lucy, she would have been
very dismal to be there by herself. how dost thou
like Dunlavin. Frank has given us such a full
description of the house that I think I almost know it
My dear love to Lucy I wish I could peep at you and
see how you look & feel but that I can only do in
my minds eye. how lonesome Dublin will be now
we have lost two houses in it, two or three more &
it will be a desert. I have not seen any of the things
since Martha told me she saw [unclear]Betsy[/unclear], they are gone
back to Dalkey and are all wonderfully well.

Remember soon to write & tell us a little about your doings
it is late so I will bid thee farewell with dear love from my
Mother and all I am thy
affectionte
Sister Selina
hast thou many new plants
