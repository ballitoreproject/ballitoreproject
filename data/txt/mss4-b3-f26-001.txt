Wicklow 28th of 9 month 1790

	My dear and honoured Grandfathers very acceptable favour from Edenderry merits my earliest acknowledgement, as it was very kind to think of me there. I hope I shall endeavour to improve by the excellent instructions contained therein, for which I am much obliged to thee, as also for the articles of intelligence which I liked very well to receive. I may inform thee since I got thy letter I have been employed most mornings in cyphering, wrote some pretty good copies, and get a spelling lesson; yet I shall not be like to improve fast until I get under my Fathers judicious care, where the example of other Boys may prove a spur to my industry, but at present Play seems my element. My dut
	My dutiful Regards attend thee and my Grandmother dear love to my Aunts, &c. in which I am
	thy affectionate Grandson
	Richard Shackleton
