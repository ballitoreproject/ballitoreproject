395
meeting to Alcester. Wm. Roberts guide.
Lodg'd at Charles Trusted's. 1st of 8th month
13 miles to meeting to Bromsgrove, guided by
Charles Trusted: a trying meeting indeed, after
which & dining at an inn, went about
12 miles to Bewdley. Lodg'd at Joseph Cotterell's.
2d meeting at nine O'Clock with the
very few there; & left it, after a snack,
for Worster, [insertion]14 miles.[/insertion] Charles Trusted still with us.
Lodg'd at Timothy Bevington's. 3d.. Had the
sad tidings that our horse, a nice creature,
was ill, trembling & sweating; a poor hacked
one was hired to draw us in our chair, 13
miles, to Bromyard: where we met with
two men & six women. After dinner returned
to worcester, the horse lazy, & came down
once on his knees, but had strength enough
presently to rise: on our arrival
at T: Bevington's door, a man acosted us
with, "Bad news, bad news, your mare
is dead." On opening her they say, her liver
appeared nearly in a kind of liquid state,
& it was thought had suffocated her.
