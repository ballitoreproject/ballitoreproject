I was treated with Henry Tuke's company in our chair, Deborah's chair
being broke, the three women went in a chaise. after arriving, a letter was
put into my hand from my dear M: Leadbeater & a sorrowful account
in it of our dear mother's state of health. 7th.. their week-day meeting, wch..
was a feeling one to me. after dinner began the family-visit, had three
sittings that night, one with a John Mitchell, & sweet wife, &c. this man
had in time back acted very wrong, & now stands disowned;- yet such
is the matchless mercy of Him with whom we have to do, that the
language of invitation to return to the Father's house was handed to
him in incouraging terms. Another of those sittings was with three
young people & strange to [underline]tell[/underline] I thought I was not easy without repeating
a little verse, "Live while you live, the Epicure will say,
"And take the pleasure of the present day:
"Live while you live the secret preacher cries
"Lord in my heart let both united be
"And give to God each moment as it flies.
"I live in pleasure [underline]while[/underline] I live in thee."
