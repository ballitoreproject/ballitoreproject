No'n soft Griese's dimpled stream
Plays the mild light of Cyntheas beam
O Queen of Shades thy succour lend
And safely guide my lovely friend
While with thy grace, thy skill & [insertion]thy[/insertion] speed
Lightly she mounts her willing steed.
And from these circles hastes away.
Whose hearts & lips entreat her stay.
Blame not this haste that gentle mind
Has never named a deed unkind*
'Twas not in Pleasure's paths to roam
She left her parents & her home
She left that home those Parents dear
A Brother's toils to aid & cheer
Nor doth her polish'd mind disdain
The rustick band & rural plain
Tho' skill'd to touch th' harmonious key
Tho' skill'd to breathe the witching lay
Yet sweeter melody is near
Worthy a listening Angel's ear
O'er Pity's chords of purest tone
Her hand Benevolence has thrown.
O why should deepest silence hide
These deeds which Fame should blazon wide
When want & shame & sorrow spread
Dim shadows o'er the fainting head
And sickness oped the yawning grave
That generous hand was stretch'd to save
The widow'd Stranger sad & lone
Pour'd to that pitying ear her moan.
Her happy household charm'd obey
That mild command, yet stedfast sway.
And while that [insertion]her[/insertion] head, that [insertion]her[/insertion] hand that [insertion]her[/insertion] heart
Such gifts of gladness can impart
Oft may the maid by Cynthea's beam
On Griese's margins graceful [deletion]move[/deletion] rove
And may kind Fate's propitious smile
The parting moment far remove.
*But Duty's laws her movement guide
seek not to bid them swerve aside
*On her the genuine graces land
meekness which never could offend
Humility with downcast eye,
And ever loved simplicity.
