Moate G. May 6th 1825
Respected Madam,
I feel it my duty not to lose a moment,
in returning my sincere thanks; for your obliging kindness to
me at all times, but more particularly on the late occasion. I yesterday
received your letter my Mr. Barclay Clibbons, whose family are among
my kindest supporters. I think, Madam, that the [unclear]mode[/unclear] you adopted
of breaking to my Parents, what I know must have given them
great pain, was the best. - I did hear of it, some weeks ago, as my
Father on receipt of it came to this country, who of course was
greatly enraged; not so much he told for my Marriage,
as for my change of Religion; but as the two steps that I have
taken, were of serious import, I took care to consider them
well. the first being under my serious consideration for
the last three years, and ever since I got under Mrs. [unclear]Bonhams[/unclear]
protection and Instruction, a Lady whom I shall always revere, and
the latter, I assure you, was under my Consideration for the

last nine months, and as I did [insertion]not[/insertion] get one sixpence by my
Wife, I cannot be charged with Interested motives. but what
she wants in other respects are fully compensated by a good mind
and a good Education. - My Father staid but one day here and
that by great persuasion; who at leaving me assured me that he
would break off all intercourse with me, and if I wrote home, my
letters should not be received. - I have the satisfaction to tell
you, that I did not repay him with disre[insertion]s[/insertion]pect or ingratitude (for he
was a good Father to me) but told him that I should always
lament his inflexibility. - therefore, Madam, it is thro' you
alone, that I hope to hear from time to time, of my family's
welfare. From the interest you have taken in me, I am sure
you will feel pleased when I tell you, that from the Estimation
that I am held in here; my friend Mr. Telford, has placed two Gentlemen,
(orphans) the Children of the late Mr. & Mrs. Philip Marsh to
Board &c with me, and to receive their Education from me, with
written directions never to let them from us to visit any where
they are Seven and Eight years old, and from the care I

hope to take of them, I think I shall not falsify the
good Characters that I have brought from you and
Mrs. Bonham. May I, Madam, expect a letter from
you, letting me know all particulars of [insertion]my[/insertion] parents &
and whether Mrs. Bonham has come to Ireland, and
where she is to be found:
I beg you will present my respectful
remembrance to Miss Doyle, thro'
whom you will be able to hear every
thing of my friends: and also to Mr.
Leadbeater & family.
I remain, Madam,
with the highest respect.
Your obt. Servt.
Patrick Canning
