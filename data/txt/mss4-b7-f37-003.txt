Dear Cousin
Mary Shackleton
I do not know that ever I took up pen to write
to thee as I do now. for have been for writeing to thee for this
week bypast. but could not do it, as if somthing stopt me. I have [insertion]ing[/insertion]
received a Letter this Day from thee makes me resolve to wright
a few lines (though with Tears) to let thee know of Our present
state My poor Father & Mother is as well as can be expected, and
my self very poorly, with my Sister Jane Marriage from Friends,
which I can say I Loved as my Self. She was Married on the 18
of last Month, to one John Shillito of Stainner Hall near
Selby I may say thou never so the place though it is only
about 1/[unclear]4[/unclear] Mile from Town, it was about 4 Months since
he first spoke to her, I know of it and always told her my
mind, She know I was sore again it, he came and asked
My Father & Mother they told him as much of their Minds
as could, Sister Jane told me Father and me it was all
ended, but I suppose the met in private place's, so took
an Oppertunity when I was from home, I whent to Shackleton
House about some repair's on Third day & was not to
return till Sixth Day, but got done sooner and came home
on Fifth Day Night about 12 OClock it being so Moonlight
and plesent made me press home — When I got there
called the Girl up, asked after My Father & Mother, then
my Sister, after I had put up my Mare, whent to bed, but
before I whent, I had a mind to see my Sister, so whent into
her room, but found She had never been in bed so asked the
Lass if she came to bed as before She said yes but whent
Ought. after I asked if she had told my Father & Mother she
said she dorst not for fear of makeing them have a bad
Night, but I told them, and shall leave thee to judge of
the distressed sittuation we was in my poor Father would
have mooved a Heart of Stone to heard him after I had
talked apiece I whent to my Unkle Armitage's they knew

Nothing of her so after that my Unkle bid me come to bed, I told
him I could not go to bed, so then called Neighbour Thompson's
up whent into their lodging room and asked them if they had
seen my Sister they told me never since 6 OClock with
my Cousin Sarrah Armitage I told them She was not in bed,
my Unkle came down to sit with my Father & me to help
to chear my Father up under his Affliction's for they was great
My Unkle said good men was to be tried, and he believed this
was a great trial to us all, I can truly say such a one as
I never met with, to have her to be disowned of the Sociaty.
Oh I am heartly sorry for her for I Loved her as my Self if any
person spoke slity of her it whent nearer to me then if they
spoke ill of me, and how I talked to her and She promist me
She would have nothing to do with him, I told my Father I
would have him to talk to her, so he did and she promist
him that.She would never Marry him in his Life Time
nor after his Death and said Father you have indered me
when I have Loved but this his no cross for I have no Love
for him so my Father he was quiat easey She gave him a kiss
and he said to her Jinny if thou deceives me, Remember me
when I am gone, I had told my Father I would mention it
to Nathl. English as I went through Leeds for I knew Jane
Loved N.E. and would mind what he said to her, but my
Father bid me not for he said She had quiat Sattisfied him
so I did not mention it to him, though I so him at Leeds as
I past through Town, but if I had it would have ment
nothing for she was gone off, when I got home She Slept
at his Unkle's in Selby on fifth Day Night, but I think
She could [unclear][/unclear] sleep to think how she had left a good
Father & [unclear]Mother[/unclear] in bed and not a bad Brother from home,
but She was bent to do it when I was ought, so She was
Marryed at Selby Church on Sixth Day Morning we have
never seen her since I can truly say I wish She may see

into it and feel what we have felt for her I can say to thee
we was quiat happy in one another's company but that She
thought nothing of I am afraid when she set of with him
at Night time Oh I have often thought of it since and
I am sure what an a trouble it will be to you when you
receive this, N. English heard on Seventh Day and said to
the Man that told him Jane Webster I am supprised, had
it been Sam I should not have wondered so much for I
always thought She had more regard for the principal —
Dear Cousin I wish I may show more respect then I have
done for the Trouth and I pray that Providence may direct
me in all my ways and in my Chousing a Wife when it
pleases him for if I go ought of the Sociaty for a Wife I
shall deserve double [unclear][/unclear] ment, but I hope I never shal[insertion]l[/insertion]
nor I never thought [unclear][/unclear]uld, Oh how I have talked to
her when She as been [unclear][/unclear] my bed side, and She made
such promises as never poor Girl did, do not let me forget
to say he as been marryed before and as three Children
the Eldest about 11 Years and Youngest 8 so she as taken
part care and a Farmer's Wife two I think She wa[unclear][/unclear]
Ought of her Mind Oh let me mind my self for the Time
to come, so Dear Cousin shall conclude with my Father
and Mother Dear Love [insertion]to[/insertion] You all as if Named and my Unkle
