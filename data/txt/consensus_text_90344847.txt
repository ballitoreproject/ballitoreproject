very antique indeed if we
judge by the old skulls and
coffins which were strewed
about here and there bleached
by the sun and by no means
adding to beauty of the scene
We hired them ponies which
afforded us great amusement
for certainly to see them of
us jogging along on such extraordinary
[unclear]temotinery[/unclear] shaped animals
[wrong line]
was very ludicrous - We had
one mansaddle for the boys
and two side ones for us -
shaped animals
