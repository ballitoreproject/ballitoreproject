Ballitore 7th: mo: 3rd:: 1804
My dear Aunt
Third
day 3rd
me for not writing before not but I hope to make it up by
writing a long letter but to begin.
I got a letter from Mary by Thomas (who came from
Rathangan last fifth day) in which she mentioned not
having received a letter from thee for a long time.
Abby Hudson is finely recovered, she goes out very often
Betty Wilson and Ha[insertion]r[/insertion]riot Higginson are at our
house; Betty has been poorly ever since she came [underline]I think.[/underline]
I go into the water every day it is very pleasant, I
am to wear a bathing shirt [insertion]but I have not began yet [/insertion] this year my mother says
I think this letter [deletion]is [/deletion] will not be entertaining, at least
what is writ[insertion]ten[/insertion] already will not but I hope to improve.
Fourth
day 4th
Yesterday evening the Hoggs arrived and brought
I am afraid thou art angry with

my mother a letter from thee which I believe she has not answer[insertion]ed[/insertion]
Ha[insertion]r[/insertion]riot has left us after having pay'd a short but
agreeable visit I hope she will soon come again.
Thou sees I am writing a scrap letter as thou desired
I have not time to write any other way as a shirt I am making
for my father takes up [insertion]my[/insertion] time so I can do nothing else
almost, but it soon [insertion]will[/insertion] be done I hope.
Fifth day
Margery Mc:: Machon, her husband, two children,
5th
and a maid, are come on a visit to her father's; the
eldest Eleanor Anne is a fine little girl just 3 a
lively brunette & the image of her mother; the other
William fair as a lilly (if I may use the expression) is
a lovely boy a year and a half old; Margery is very [insertion]thin[/insertion]
her husband is a fine fat clergy man he keeps a school
and when they were coming one of his scholar's insisted
on coming too so they brought him, his name is
John Walker.
Mary Stephens is talking of going to Dublin
with Betsy Barrington but they have not yet fixed

the day yet I hope it may be soon as we will not
go to School while she is away Mary will stay a month
My uncle Abraham will soon take the roof off
the [insertion]mill[/insertion] house, Mary will come to lodge with us I expect,
Lydia and Margaret are to go to Betsy Barrington's.
Sixth
The Hoggs are gone they went this morning;
Day 6th
I think Mary a very agreable young woman,
pleasant and unaffected.
I suppose Anne Haughton is at Suir Island (as
her father was here last first-day and he said she was
to go [insertion]about[/insertion] the middle of the week;) if thou should go there
in thy way to Clogheen please desires her to write
soon to me as I wrote to her a short time before she
left Carlow which she has not answered yet.
I have not any more to say at present so conclude
with dear love to thee thy afft niece
Write soon
E Leadbeater

I fear I have not anything worth
my dear friend Sally's perusal but as Elizabeth seems
to want to send thee a pretty long letter I am
striving to put a little to it -
I believe it was since thou went
that Eliza left us: she is not "looking towards
home yet". M: Stephens & B: Barrington
have fixed on going to Dublin? next third
day -- young Lydia is to be with us.--
Betsy was very agreeably
surprised this day week by her brother Jonathon's
coming to see her - he left this on 5th day -
we got up at 5 o'clock and went as far as
crooks-town with him
I thought when I was beginning
this that I had nothing worth writing
but Elizabeth would have me write.
News is very scarce [underline]here[/underline]. -
Hannah desires to be remembered
by thee - I am sure Eliza
would were she here -- Farewel my
dear Sally and mayest thou enjoy
the company of thy friends - is the wish of
thy affectionate Ann Bewley -
