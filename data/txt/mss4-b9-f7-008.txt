My dear Elizabeth
I am not surprised at the
reluctance you feel to be Sole executrix to your
Fathers will; nor should I be the person to advise
you to it if I thought it would bring any trouble
upon you, that you should not have, being
joint executor with another. C F's opinion to
which you allude I believe related generally
to the matter in hand and not particularly
to my case; and is grounded on the principle
that a second executor is only necessary when
the parties concerned are not of one family
or not on [insertion]a[/insertion] friendly and intimate footing, nor
likely to [unclear]second[/unclear] with their counsel and exertion
otherwise the person who might [unclear]prove[/unclear] the Will.
It is very evident that it could be improper
on many accounts for me to be sole executor.
For you to be so is quite different, nor do I see
I confess, when you may be sure of all our assistance
in every way, why, if you are willing to act
jointly, you should hesitate to undertake the
part alone, particularly as you do not

become [deletion]a[/deletion] [underline]more[/underline] accountable thereby. I am
quite aware how arduous the undertaking
must appear to [deletion]one[/deletion][insertion]a female[/insertion] who had no brothers or
friends whose interests as well as inclination
would lead them to assist; but this is not your
case. In fact after all it will be only allowing
your name to appear by itself on occasions
in which you are satisfied to join it with
mine and on which also you will not
I am sure let it appear without first consulting
your brothers and sisters. So come
to them as soon as you can, bringing the
Will with you and let us proceed to business
the longer matters remain in their present
[insertion]unsettled[/insertion] state, the more difficulties there will be in
bringing them to a close. Should you be
anxious to make your stay here short, send
desirous to make your stay here short, send
me the Will by a safe hand and let me
know the Procter you wish to employ and
I [insertion]shall[/insertion] have everything arranged beforehand
I [insertion]shall[/insertion] have every thing arranged beforehand
as far as can be done without you. Perhaps
Eben would make out an amended copy
of the statement [deletion]of the[/deletion] [insertion]or[/insertion] valuation of the property

by the affirmed account of which, the stamp
on the Probate will have to be ascertained.
The rough estimate was left with the other papers.
I do not think I need add any more on the subject
till I see you except merely to hope, that you will
[unclear]herein,[/unclear] how any good reason that can be advanced
against your administering alone will equally
apply to your doing it jointly with another, [deletion]that[/deletion]
[deletion]for[/deletion] your apprehensions [insertion]about either[/insertion] as far as I can see are
groundless. The Carrier arrived yesterday
with the furniture by which we are obliged
Sarah desires me to say you made a [unclear][/unclear]
in sending her some of the articles, but that
it can be easily satisfied. I should have
replied to your letter sooner, but I waited
past the first post to know if Sarah had any
message, and when she sat down to write, the
other night at [unclear]Kingstons[/unclear], she was almost [insertion]literally[/insertion] [deletion]litterally[/deletion]
without paper or ink, such is the state of things
in [insertion]that[/insertion] part of the world. Yesterday I was particularly
engaged till it was too late for post. If you are
not satisfied with what I have written, come and
talk to me. I think I may say you have
my decided opinion and that on which I mean
to act as far as I am concerned

not to screen myself from trouble, because I shall
in one case as well as the other consider myself
bound to lighten the burden on you as far as
lies in my power adieu and believe me
your affectionate brother [unclear]EB[/unclear]
