Dear Friend,
In some sense of that sympathy & union, which renders
the church of Christ a compact body; I tender[insertion]ly[/insertion] & affectionately salute thee.
I most sincerely wish thee a good journey - good to thyself, & so to others -
I cannot doubt of the propriety of thy mission to that past of the Lord's
vineyard - I had an evidence in myself in solemn silence that thou
wert under the Master's appointment for thost service, & I earnestly
desire the wisdom & power of Truth may seal it's own evidence on
all thy labours.
And, dear friend, though I apprehend myself a younger
brother, & now addressing myself to one who was in Christ before
me; yet permit me to offer [deletion][/deletion] to thy thoughts a few sentiments
which have been sealed useful on my heart.
First - It is a most solemn & awful thing to assume the name
of the Lord's ambassador - I believe thou considers' it so - Whence
ought we also to consider the steep obligation we are under to receive
from him not only his instructions, but our credentials.
Secondly, those will not be withheld, if we wait our Master's time,
his sound will be certain & his discoveries clear - We shall not say like
Ahimaaz, "When I ran, there was a tumult" - but distinctly receive
& deliver our Master's message, in his own wisdom & spirit.
Thirdly, in all our service let us remember our Lord's dignity,
& endeavour to maintain it according to the proportion of strength
vouchsafed, both in purity of life, & singleness to him, in our
ministeriel capacity, being empty without him, & only filled with
his fulness.
Fourthly, let us learn to try the spirits, whether they are of God.
I have seen a danger (especially in your sex) of being taken by the
passions - the passionate preacher hath affected the passionate
 hearer - both have been in raptures, & neither of them profited -
This is a place I would endeavour to guard thee in, my dear
friend, as I am apprehensive the emotions of thy mind are sometimes
strong & animated - Mistake not the warmth of passion for the gospel
authority - tho first is like the rattling thunder, which frights,
but never hurts - the last is like the lightning from the east, which
illuminates, & at times breaks through all opposition, & melts every obstruction.
I

I know the integrity of thy heart & what is infinitely better) our
father who is in heaven also knows it, & will not forget to be [unclear]gracious[/unclear]
And therefore with the most unreserved freedom remind thee
of these things - May [insertion]thy[/insertion] Urim & Thummim be with the holy one,
whom thou provedst at Massah (which implies the hour of temptation)
& with whom thou strivedst at the waters of Meribah (or strife) - Look
carefully to him in all thy goings - so shalt thou dip thy foot in
oil, when thou treadest on high places, & the arms of thy hands be
strengthened by the mighty God of Jacob - If deep poverty be thy
 lot, be not disquieted, neither pour forth thy complaints to any mortal - 
have no confident but eternal help - I never knew deeper
poverty, nor more glorious riches than in that land - but i
found it safe to wear my sackcloth on my loins & wear my best garments
honestly & sparingly - Receive no obligation from that quarter,
which thou can avoid, lest they say, "I have requited her labour,"
or make vain the purport of thy testimony - In the course of [unclear]our[/unclear]
passage, be courteous to all, unless restricted by secret direction [unclear]with[/unclear]
respect to any particular: which I have found my peculiar duty
in some parts - Let not affability enervate thy mind, nor lead
from the steady superiority attending the faithful minister - & yet
guard against a spirit, which leads jealous people sometimes to say,
"There is none righteous, no not one" - & therein to overlook the hidden,
suffering seed - Let thy eye be in thy head; so shall thy goings be
ordered of the Lord, & be attended with peace to thyself, comfort to the
living, & general usefulness to the church - Be not hasty to embrace the
offer of any companion in service: try their spirits, & feel the liberty
of Truth in it - I should rather choose to take one occasionally,
as way might open, than engage for any considerable journey - I
think it still more necessary to press thy declining any compassion
from England, as Europe, who might have a concern for themselves, to discharge
their own duty, without regard to thine : & so might another be
oppressed by thee.
Farewell; & may the Lord of all consolation be with thee in every
trial, support thee by his arm, enrich thee by his grace, replenish
thee by his wisdom, & comfort thee by his rod & his staff - I am thy
assured friend
 Samuel Fothergill.
