My dear friend


        I am indebted to thee for a few lines subjoined to a letter of Sallys  I have also to acknowledge thy affectionate remembrance of 24th ultimate  These salutations, be assured are very grateful & acceptable to me, & very desirable  but were there, from some cause or other, a stagnation of such an intercourse, yet I trust there would be no decay of vital friendship between us; because I trust & hope that a gracious & merciful Providence will condescend to keep & preserve us near the source, which feeds & supports supplies religious fellowship  I know, & thou knowest there may be an over-doing in the writing, as well as in the speaking-way  there may be a bringing too much stuff  but if we go feelingly along, if we mind the openings & shuttings of the Spirit, the locking and ^the^ unlocking of the key of David, there will neither be the lavishing, nor withholding, which tendeth to poverty. Industry and frugality are (under the divine blessing) the ordinary means of becoming rich, and able to administer to the necessities of others. A wise householder hath a treasury, a store-room, in which he lays by what is not for present use  it is safely locked up, & he brings out of it what is necessary in due season, as occasion requires  Such a wise householder I would have thee, to beloved friend, to be  & such I trust thou art  [page number] 132 May^est^ thou increase in wisdom & stature in the heavenly gift, still taking proportionally deep root downwards as thou shoots [sic] upward, & still giving the glory and gift consecrating the gain of all to Him, who alone is the Author of every good & perfect gift, and who, through infinite in loving kindness and mercy, yet is ever jealous of His own honour, & will not allow His servants ostentatiously to deck and adorn themselves with His jewels.
