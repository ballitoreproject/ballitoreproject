Waterford Jany 19th 1802
My dear Cousin
the opportunity afforded of expressing my thanks
for the notice taken of me by those I hold so dear
- to my dear Mary I am indebted for her epistolatory
communications & other kind inquiries & to my dear
Sally for the latter I hope my tardiness with the
pen is not imputed to an indifference about continuing
the pleasing intercourse — Be assured
my wishes are at times ardent to hear of your
comforts & happiness — I flattered myself I might
ere now have been enabled to pay you a visit & to
have announced the arrival of a little Stranger to
whom is attached the name ever to be revered of
Richard Shackleton about two months since - My
Rebecca is not completely re-established in her health
her recovery has been retarded by some unpleasant events
With pleasure I now embrace

occurring in her fathers family which have preyed
on her spirits — however I think her uneasiness
is rather decreasing. During the last Summer we
have had much sickness among the Little ones — The
Measles & Chink cough combined their forces — Eliza
was the greatest sufferer brought as we apprehended
near the brink of the grave. The Country
air was resorted to we think with good effect.
There were lately some symptoms of a return of
cough but I hope is does not gain ground.
I expect thy skill in the healing art is much
improved as I suppose cases are not wanted
to derive experience from — I spent yester evening
very pleasantly with our old Friend John [unclear]Elsey[/unclear]
retracing the memory of old scenes — his manners
are polite & unaffected — the Regiment he belongs
to I think called the Nottingham Fencibles lies in
Mallow — he was bound from Bristol for Cork but after

a dangerous tossing about Waterford harbour afforded
an asylum for the vessel he embarked in — he did
not chuse to trust any longer to the instable waves
but preferred to travel on terra firma. I hope your
little man has got the better of the lameness that
was so alarming. Becca joins me in best wishes
for all that surround your fireside. My love
to Cousin Sally & all inquiring Friends
Believe me
Thine affectionate
William Rayner

Waterford 26 May 1803
I regularly received & with much pleasure my dear Cousins
communications of 2mo 2nd 25th Ultimo & 21st Current — I deferred replying from
time to time until a more favourable opportunity, (which did not present
itself,) so long as to expose myself to a very severe censure in the
high court of Friendship — thy last furnishes me with a pretext
for surmounting all obstacles but surely there is not & I hope never
will be an occasion to resort to apology on requiring any exertion
of mine great or small — Do not charge me with laziness
for mutilating the book rather than transcribe the part which was
wanted - I please n[unclear]ot g[/unclear]uilty — I had begun & from my
progress perceived the [unclear][/unclear] would be voluminous - The Book
also having suffered by [unclear][/unclear] voracious appetite of Time & quite in
deshabille. I examined it more minutely & found the Dictionary
quite independant of the other part & therefore separated it without
any difficulty - This advantage I owe to the tardiness of the Book
binder in whose hands I [unclear][/unclear] it once to repair the cover - the whole
Book I will with pleasure relinquish if thou wish at any time
to have it. I hope the effects of the Influenza are entirely removed
so as to allow thee to range at large in the flowery fields
of Poetry I rejoice at thy return to the fairy land. It
gave me much pleasure to be informed that there is a prospect
of the establishment being resumed & wish young Richard success
I find my limits of time & paper drawing to a close I therefore
must conclude with a promise of a few lines in addition
very soon. We are favoured with tolerable good health —
the 3 children have been inoculated with the Vaccine by Dr Poole
who was a strenuous advocate for the operation & at first the
only one here from Sarah the infection was taken for me
& I believe it has taken the proper effect on us all. I wish to
be affectionately remembered to Cousin Sally, Molly Hudson & —
my heart flows with affec[unclear][/unclear] [unclear]wh[/unclear]en I think of you all
Adieu Wm Rayner
