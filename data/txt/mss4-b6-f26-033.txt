I don't know whether I am right or wrong in sending this
note, for I am sometimes afraid of placing too much dependance
to it's expiation on the acknowledgement of a fault. My urging thee

7th day evening that we staid too long in the garden, & showed me
how very weak I was so soon to break the resolution, which I thought I
had made the evening before, not to do so again. Yet I doubt did I
feel as much sorrow as I ought, tho I did not desire to be exempt
from some, or to feel the serenity I did not deserve as [deletion][/deletion] parting
from my friends then. I am afraid I occasioned thee such feelings as

thou experienced at M:G's the other evening, & that fear was my
most painful sensation - My heart was dull, & while thou sate by
it was a little cheered I thought - so [deletion]from[/deletion] [insertion]to[/insertion] this selfish motive I sacrificed
better considerations. Don't let me do so I again, I cannot trust
my own deceitful heart, but let not thy motives be swayed by
my weakness. Farewell, MS.
