Alice brought the backgammon
board and we two began to play
at the [unclear]dice[/unclear] - Whilst this engaged
her brother joined us and
when our game was finished
he took Alice's place and I beat
him but the second time he
retaliated and vanquished me
completely - So we were even
after all - Ned staid in the
room until about 9 1/2 and
Hannah Pim [insertion]Alice[/insertion] and I withdrew
at about 1/4 to ten - So much
for this day -
19th.. Wednesday .-. Very mild
but cloudy and a slight rain.
Ned did not seem so well
this morning and we spent
the first part of it in a very
queer manner which I dont
think I shall soon forget.
But afterwards we got our better
