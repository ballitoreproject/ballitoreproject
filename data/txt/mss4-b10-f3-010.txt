Ballina Sept 11/48
My dear Eliza
I have been here
now for more than a week
and during that time have
not received a line from any
one at home except from
Edward. I wrote to my
Mother on arriving here and
thought that either she or
you would have replied before
this, but I suppose you
are busy preparing for your
travels, so will endeavour to
excuse you for your seeming
neglect. I received a newspaper

this morning directed
by you and conclude from
that, that you have not yet
taken your departure, should
you have done so, I will
send a few lines to Martha
by this post directing her
to open this, and requesting
her to reply to it, as if it
had been originally intended
for her. I have taken
a sitting and bedroom at the
hotel here by the week, and
although [deletion][/deletion] [insertion]they are[/insertion] not quite as comfortable
as I could wish, I
have no great cause for complaint.
They are both large
the one is which I now write
almost as extensive as the dressing
room in Britain St, but
not overstocked with furniture,
a table, sofa, sideboard, half
 a dozen chairs, a pair of bel[unclear][/unclear]
and a large basket for turf
being the sum total, they are
placed at such convenient distances
from one another, that
with a little care, there is not
much danger of breaking one's
shins against them, which
I am sure would be a great
source of satisfaction to Frank
should he ever pay me a visit
in this here place.
I have dined out but twice,
once at Mr Lee's and once at
Coll Jackson's, the latter told
me his hours for breakfast, dinner
& tea, and gave me a general
invitation to each and all whenever
I might happen to be in his

neighbourhood, and said in
addition there was always a
bed at my service. They are
both as kind and obliging as it
is possible for men to be, and
I am sorry I have no means
of returning the obligations they
put me under, but console my
self with the thought that it
is not so much for my own sake,
as for the sake of the society for
whom I act that they show me
such marked respect.
And truly the Society of Friends
may well be proud of the name
they have made for themselves
in this country! Many times
in the day do I hear them praised
by gentle and simple, as being
the means of saving multitudes
if not from starvation at least

from the workhouse during
the last season, every one
hoping they will still continue
their experiments in agriculture,
and blessing them for the
exertions they have already made.
I have not yet commenced
reading any of the books you
lent me, the newspapers being
as much as I had time to
manage, but hope to derive
pleasure from them during
the long nights of the coming
winter.
William Todhunter and Joseph
R. Pim were here for a few days
last week, the former is not
only a very clever man of business
but a most agreeable companion,
he is known and respected

by all persons of influence
not only in this quarter but
in almost the whole of Connaught,
he has the manners
of a man who has mixed a
good deal in society, it was
very amusing to hear him
and Mr Lees joking with one
another, they are old friends
and have a high opinion of
each other's good qualities.
It is now very late and
my turf fire is burned out
so I think it almost time
to bring this letter to a close
which I do by sending my love
to all at home, My Mother, Thomas
 Martha, Manliff, Frederick, and to
any one else, [deletion][/deletion] you think would
care about it, and by subscribing myself
your affectionate brother Arthur
