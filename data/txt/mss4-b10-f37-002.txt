10/14/34 Glendruid
I wrote thee an account up to yesterday,
which was second day. Jane Stephens & I set off to
walk to the Scalp the day looked cloudy but we
persevered. we rested ourselves up on some of the
rocks & eat one bit of bread with a relish I shared
mine with Trebeck who is still faithful coming
home we got a little rain but it did not signify
they were alone since my Mother had gone with
Edward to Fassaroe, I was not home till tea
Jane Stephens drank tea here.
3rd up early & and at breakfast to go to town to
monthly meeting. Eliza & I it was a beautiful day
after a very wet night, we were only in time for
second meeting. Anna Boardman & Adam Banks
presented their marriage & thy little nephew
Charles' birthnote was read. went to see Sarah
who seems finely. Asked Sally Malone to come
out with me but she refused as she did not
feel easy at leaving her mother. Eliza staid
in town with Martha so - I came out [underline]solus[/underline]
4th day - Manliff asked me to go to Fassaroe so
I equipped myself & mounted my horse & set off

Johnny came with us on the poney went to
Bray first & from that across the race course where
we though we would have had a nice gallop
but Johnny being a little of cow and thought it
better not Manliff left us at the hill going
up to his farm & sent Johnny & I round by the Dargle
& Enniskerry to use up the time & to call round
for him, going up the Dargle a gentleman or at
least a person who had the appearance of one
was walking after us, & I hearing a voice turned
round when he told me that my horse had a
stone in her foot, he very kindly took it out & it was
so fast in that he had to knock it out with another
stone, this was our only little adventure we
saw Arthur who seems rather see-saw still &
Sally Bergan, her child is not getting on well she
seems rather uneasy about him & told me
to be sure never to marry, she need scarcely
have given me that caution, as there seems not
much likelihood of it. we were home to dinner
& had the pleasure of Jane Stephens company
to take share of our hare. Patty & the children
came in the evening. I was sitting in the
parlour at my work after dinner by myself

when Mr Fenell Jane & Bessy came in he brought
me some little tools made of Rose-wood for modelling
in wax, which he was telling me about
& which he recommended my trying as he thought
I would like it & that it would give me more
knowledge in drawing, he had made them him
self, he staid above half an hour & was as pleasant
and chatty as he could be ([underline]I would like to[/underline]
[underline]be married to such a man[/underline]) is not that a fine
speech.
5th day - Sent the car to the Parade to
meet Eliza. my Aunt F Sally & Mary Jacob
& [underline]tail[/underline] came out they were here before the
car went for E- or Emy & I would have gone
in it, indeed I had her bonnet on to go and yet the
very goodhumouredly let me take it off & bore the
disappointment very well. The Jacobs went in
soon after dinner.
6th day a very stormy showery day & very cold nothing
particular happened & no visitor.
7th Edward came out to day to Fassaroe & is
to take the four eldest children to town with him
Sarah is to be out next week & wishes to have them
 out of her way. Mr [unclear]Fennell[/unclear] came down to pay
me a visit & to see what I had done in the wax
but I was out, he asked Eliza could she shew it
to him & said I had made a very good attempt

for the first. Patty & Jane drank tea here we had
some of the Annuals to entertain them. I forgot to
mention that my Aunt F is staying with us.
1st day - my Mother Aunt & I went to meeting
when we came home found Ruhard & Frederic
from Dublin & Arthur from Fassaroe.
now I have nearly filled my sheet & may acknowledge
that I got thy very acceptable note
to day, I am sorry to hear thou hast had such
a heavy cold, & I hope thou wilt not think of
parting Biddy untill Regy is quite able to walk
We have seen nothing of the Henrys this week back

Mr Thomas is in the country, we are all here in our
best fashions, Eliza is going to get a bit taken off the
green house for her plants & that is the only sure thing
there is doing. The Glen is but little changed yet & Halloween
is coming fast & winter at the back of it. it is wonderful
how time passes over let it be pleasant or the
contrary still it flies & that [deletion]that[/deletion] with wings. has
Frank stopped keeping the journal for me already surely he
ought to follow my example & fill me a sheet. hoping
soon to hear from you again and wishing you both well
I am thy affectionate sister Selina
dear love to Frank
