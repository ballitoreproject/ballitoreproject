Cork 1st month 24th 1789

My dear Uncle

	I know I have lain long in thy debt & am sensible of thy lenient disposition towards me, yet feeling in my heart a little stirring of an honourable if not an honest principle (for methinks we sometimes feel a selfish honour when exclusive of it, honesty is at a low ebb) & the renewing of an unfeigned love I judge myself equiped [sic] for saluting thee, though my possession of any other likeness of good seems taken away  Thou knowst where we are, & hast fatherly sympathy enough to perceive in the general, how we are; If I tell thee that my soul as an individual (let other [sic] speak for themselves) has in the course of our visit to the families of friends in this city passed by the gates of Hell & death, thou canst beleive [sic] it, & will perhaps say it was well for thee thou didst truly I dare not gainsay it, because the deceitfulness of my own ^heart^ is such that it cannot be removed by pleasant ^things^ nor does fitness for the little services we are engaged in spring out of the most sensible & gratifying operations of the spirit; but out of those unsearchable baptisms which nevertheless demonstrate they are of the holy Ghost & fire because they leave an empty temple, a temple ready to be filled the presence wherein there is life; for according to my small knowledge of good Im not upset that after all the joy of the Lord is our strength & were it not that in the beginning of this visit my spirit was sweetly consolated [sic] therewith, I very much doubt whether from many of my feelings & deep provings since, I should have held out till now; peradventure it possessed some of that sacred efficacy Elijahs forty days sustenance is distinguished for, & therefore to the praise of that grace by which I am what I am my confidence has not wholly failed me in the deeps  Now towards the conclusion we find ourselves unexpectedly detained a week on account of the flood having rendered the meeting house unfit for friends to sit in at the usual time  A few visits remain, which the weather & our M Ds almost continual indisposition render difficult to get performed  None of our minds seem quite at liberty to return home, though we find that we are all wanted there. Dear MD talks daily about setting off & is often in affliction concerning it yet way does not open  All thats within me prays that as we have been mercifully strengthened to 
drink in this place a bitter cup, we may not in our own wills refuse any dregs which in ^infinite^ wisdom are intended ^in part^ to constitute the cup of salutation  But the flesh is weak!  I dont make this remark simply in allusion to our mutual friend M.D. but from the resistance which I feel in my nature (& have thought it my duty to conceal since coming here) to the wormwood & the gall  Friends here have generally received us kindly & we hope that in some families the seed has been divinely visitted [sic] though through weak instruments which we see are still chosen to dear S. Shackletons comfort & mind  a few have refused us & whether their hearts will relent is yet to try  We cannot however but sympathize with a tried afflicted remnant [paper folded] a greatly despised remnant in this meeting whose hands I do beleive [sic] will grow stronger & stronger, be more & more instructed to war & their fingers to fight for however the boasters over the pure lowly seed may exalt themselves yet they cannot stand in the day of judgment neither prevent the pulpitting of [paper torn] promise that the law shall be [obscured by seal] & made honourable
We have of late had divers letters from our friends of England & France viz from P. Chester J. Hoyland, G Dillwyn on 5th day last & from L Majolier, his wife & Magdalene Benezet They all give accounts of the healths of those in whose welfare we are nearly interested being well as usual  Patience gives account of the happy close of dear L Hawksworth the 17th ultimate one of J. Rowes neices [sic] married to Robert Lambert having brought him a son but had not since (several weeks after) had her understanding &c  John Hoyland says his wife laid before their monthly meeting a concern to visit the families of friends at York without knowing that they ^of York^ had any such visit in view, but the same day the subject was before them & our beloved sister Anne bound to the service in which they had since engaged & were going prosperously forward  G Dillwyn gives account that J Thornton & J Pemberton were in London & that J Pemberton looks bravely & is so far releived [sic] that he has ^while^ with J. T. frequently appeared in the exercise of his gift, I hope the mysterious ways in which his allwise conductor has seen meet to exercise him, will yet be made streights [sic] before him to the comfort & releif [sic] of his own mind & many of those who love him 
concerning himself he says that he has been at the quarterly meeting for Hertfordshire & at the interrment [sic] of dear LH [?] at Alton & that since his return to London does not find it squeeze ^him [illegible]^ so hard as it did before, though there is still a kind of sorrowful feel which he cannot explicate, but does not see any way of escape from it onto the country  so much I thought would be acceptable  he also says that A Fothergill is dangerously ill of a rheumatic fever  my beloved companions being now at Spring Mt. [illegible] for a few hours dont know of my writing so accept the scrawling [?] out their expressions of love & as far as mine goes let it make acceptable this salutation from thy poor but affectionate SRGrubb
