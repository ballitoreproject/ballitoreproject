30d [deletion][/deletion] [insertion]are[/insertion] 2.. 6 - Tht would buy
a pair of shoes - &c
[deletion]March[/deletion] Father - Excellent?
I see they learn from one
another, as children learn
to talk fast enough in
the same way -
But are not they tired
sitting?
Son - They march
in measured steps
round the room
between every lesson
I observed particularly
that they never seemed tired
of any thing, but sometimes
asked to go on longer with
what they were doing
asked them questions
in such a way as to prompt
them to give right answers
The subject of honesty was
brought in, & the childrens
sentiments [insertion]opinions[/insertion] were very amusing
[deletion]Father But [unclear][/unclear][/deletion]
Father - I like that
way of asking children questions
better than preaching long sermons
to them, or giving them advice
they neither like[deletion]d[/deletion] or understand.
Son - Nothing pleased me
more than that, because
I saw how the children
James Christy
Stramore
S Shackleton
Gilford

came round by degrees
to think right & give good
opinions, tho' at first
they often said what was
wrong.
Father - I'm glad to hear
that, because it shows
they are not little parrots.
Son - It would take me
all day, if I told you all
I saw, but there is a book
written by Mr Wilderspen that
gives a full account of
the whole plan, I'll try to
borrow it for you.
Father- We'll propose
to have it bought for our
Library - but what else did
they learn besides [underline]pictures[/underline]?
Son - They learned their
letters from a monitor who
kept them a very short time
at once at the card - then
taught them the names of
triangles, squares, angles &c &c -
they were taught to add, &
subtract [insertion]& multiply[/insertion] in a very pleasant
way by little balls moved
upon wires, which they all with
on accord pronounced [deletion][/deletion]
with a tune - 1 + 1 make 2 - 2 +
1 make 3 - &c - & at every 10
there was a higher tone of delight
The pence table began thus
20d is 1.8 - that would be
too much to lose -
