Waterford 24 Eleventhmonth 1785
My dear Molly
I am sorry I can not convey a
more favourable account of poor Pat - he is now
in a very precarious way he had been better yesterday
& the night before but last night had a relapse
however they are in hopes he may receive some benefit
from the night as he seems more composed than in
the morning - The Doctors are very attentive -
His Brother is come to town but I believe has not been
admitted to see him for fear of disturbing him - I thank
thee for thy caution which I should certainly observe
were I to expose myself - I have not gone into his
room as I could be of no service & seldom go farther
than the door to inquire how he is

I believe I shall soon meet with an opportunity of
sending Hannah Haughtons Boxes to her as we frequently
send Glass to Cork & have a Quantity to send
then next opportunity - They are locked up in a
place belonging to Jos: Strangman so that there need
be no dread of contracting infection from them -
I do not exactly know whether the Disorder poor Pat
labours under be the same species of a fever that
T: Jacob had - very probably it is the same as there
are many in a situation equally alarming with our
dear Friend - I believe this to be a very unwholesome
place, there have been of late such noisome vapours
that a person can scarce breathe while they prevail
I hope my Aunt has ere now got the better of her
complaint - Farewell believe me to be very affectiont
I did not hear of Sallys coming to this
[unclear][/unclear] week
thine
William Rayner
