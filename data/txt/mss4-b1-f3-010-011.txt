55. 		R. S. to his Father
	“Dear Father,
		We received thine, dated at Cooladine, and are glad that they report of this extraordinary visit tallies with what we have already heard of that service. It is also a pleasure, and perhaps will be a profit to us, that thou art yoked along with them. Thy letter to my wife, from Kilnock, was particularly agreeable. I have many times thought, of late, of that King in Israel, whose heart so rejoiced in the testimony of his God, that he forgot the man and the king, and publicly exposed himself; appearing with the outward, visible, and accepted signs of a priest unto God. And who were they who despised him for it? Such as had not an eye open to the beauty and dignity of the sacred function; which was not less glorious, but more so, than royal majesty. But who are they whom the King will delight P.55] thus to honour with proclaiming his name and truth, and make happy the name and instruments of the salvation of others, and of their own souls? Those who neither seek honour to themselves, nor shun shame.
					I am, with true respect,
						Thy dutiful and affectionate son,
										R.S.”
