The Appian Way [unclear][/unclear] march to [unclear][/unclear]
My dearest Mary - I [unclear]mayst[/unclear] take shame
to myself for my long silence, and neglect
of your letters & story - but I do not - for [deletion]I[/deletion] had
had ability I would not have served my dear
niece so. - I need not go over my reasons, for you
know them & you also know they are cogent
I shall make your heart glad by saying I feel better
today than for some time past, I suppose it is
partly that the weather today is a little milder.
I am very much pleased indeed to see
poor Rose Harper appear in her new garment
of print (quite a pun) which well becomes her
for she looks remarkably well & interesting
I am very glad my dear to see your talents
turned to a wider field of usefulness in the
[unclear]honor[/unclear] of spreading abroad [deletion][/deletion] truthful
examples of the trials attendant on the
laxity of principles, which so often grieves us
in our poor. - We must consider & understand
their manifold temptations, from which our
sheltered position screens us, before we let
ourselves judge them to harshly - I think
Rose will be of use in her generation - & as I
said before she is exceedingly interesting.
As I am deterred of going into town just
at present I do not take the Bond of Brotherhood
to P. K. - and I do not fancy his
getting the Journal until the late is quite
finished. - He is a queer old fellow & might
mislay it. - & he is also so much of a bigot, with
all his many good qualities, that I must make
him sensible that the story has nothing to do
with conversion - or "perversion" - as he would
think. I wont say "say" to me. Miss A [unclear][/unclear]
was greatly pleased & longs to hear the rest
of it - I think your Aunt Cole will be greatly
delighted with it. I did not forget Mrs Car[unclear][/unclear]

letter & certainly intended to enclose it back in
my first to you - which intention was not to
supported as this is my first in reply. The Dr.
intends to cure you The Valentine when he
has done [unclear]at writing[/unclear] as in his circle & when
"Aunt Judy" Both have returned it to him,
you see how I ignore all rules - and let them
figure away useless to me. I sent a parcel of
work & a note to dear Polly by the servant of the
romantic name. -- I am greatly touched by my
dear Niece's affectionate, imitation - which for
the present I must decline, when I regain my old
state of locomotive ability I may hope for the
 dear privilege of going [deletion][/deletion] amongst my
nieces who are to me as daughters, at present
I am very dependant - but the warmer weather
may enable me to do without aid except what
any servant can give me - (putting on my stockings
& vests) - now I am galvanized every morning
(when the battery will work - as sometimes it
will not) - and have to lie [unclear]pardon[/unclear] in bed ready
or else sitting up doing a stitch of work [unclear][/unclear]
so not yet has fed the Dr [unclear]Whip[/unclear] [unclear]devotees[/unclear]
& given the latter has fed in his room then
the torture begins on me & I come down to a
late scramble of breakfast for myself - it is [unclear]narrow[/unclear]
& I am trying to get this written before
visitors come - as they often begin at eleven
Dr [unclear]Hanoy[/unclear] is still very, very poorly - but is able
to sit up in his chair in his room - the weather
is greatly against his more rapid recovery, & his
nephew Joe is still in attendance, [deletion][/deletion]
[deletion][/deletion]. Dear Brother is
getting through the winter wonderfully here
I think his illness in the summer [unclear]weakened[/unclear] his
constitution. - I hope you can decipher this, I
cannot sit with comfort at the table by the fire,
crockery, and I will not sit in the window
at the Davenport from a head of cold I send you
some of Nan's letters to remind you of the dear [unclear]lady[/unclear]
Selina loves them - as Matt, Polly & yourself. I never
can give the perusal of my dear Mary's which
are as profitable to the mind, but not as free from
