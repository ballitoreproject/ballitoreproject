1729/30
Dear Sister!
I received a line from thee &
Brother & Sister, by which I understand that you
are [deletion]all[/deletion] in good Health, but am sorry to hear yt little
Dickey has been sa bad. & like wise I am very sorry to
hear of Abigail Faucit's Death, for I was afraid that
I should hear of some body's Death. The Occasion that
I write from Skipton, I came to see Cousin David, & wife
before I had been a Week wth my Mother, she being in a
strait two of her Maids being gone sick away & having
but one, she & Cousin David desir'd me to stay two or three
weeks with them where I have been near a Month,
Since I came to Skipton here has been a pretty many
Friends, viz J:no Fothergill, who had an Evening
Meeting here last first Day night but one: who Enquir'd
how Bro:r Abraham & Sister far'd & were glad to hear
yt they did well, & Benj:n Bartlett, has been here also
severall times, who also made Enquiry how ye all
fared, also Benjamina Padley was here, & here are
a pretty many Friends in & about Skipton who Enquired
of you. I have been once at William Slaters
all Night. & his wife desir'd me w:n I visit to remember
her Dear Love to you all, Also I was a J:no Binn's
who remember Their Love to you all. Also Neighbours
Enquired how you live, Laurence Shaw wife is dead,
who has laid a pretty while Sick, But Here are not many
Persons sick here abouts at Present. So Dear Sister

I shall wholly be - be Silent as to wt thou & I used to
Discourse on before I came over, So I would have thee
be pretty easy till I see thee again, For I would gladly be
wth my Mother only my Cousin Anne is not brought to
bed yet: They having [unclear]2 &[/unclear] boys & having no other girl as
yet, or Else I Could have been glad of this Opportunity
of Coming over wth Grace King, who is com'd about her
Business to Dublin, By Whom I desire you all would
write & let me know how ye fare, as also how little
Richard do's & who he lyes wth: for If I had him here
I Should not be so keen of coming over, If Sister Margret
be fully Concluded I should bring a Girl over w:th me
I shall make Enquiry for one as suitable as I can -
Also here is a Boy of Cousin Josephs whose name is
Christopher Hall who has been here near 2 years, who
they had thought to have had for a Prentice, but are
just going to turn away, who is a Strong lusty Boy
also Coz: David thinks he would take Learning well
If Bro:r Abra:m be willing I shall speak to his Father
or make Enquiry for another for him Either. I Question
but it will be ye Second Month if not further before
I can come, & I could be glad If Brother Simeon would
come wth me for he rather Inclines to it but I do not
know as yet whether he will be gotten out or not.
He Told me last Market Day that his Maiden Jane
was for going away wch: I think she only talks off
but if she do they would be glad of either thee or me
to live wth them. Not having time Now (it being
pretty late in ye Evening) to Enlarge much more
I Conclude wth: Mothers dear Love to ye: as also my
Brothers Sisters & Cousins Love to y.ee Also I desire ye
to Remember My dear Love to Brother & Sister as also
to thy Self I rest Thy Loving Sister.
Mary Wilkinson.
