Clonmel: 25 of 1st month 1789


25


My dear Fathers truely [sic] acceptable letter I received, & it is comfortable to find you all preserved in pretty good health (particular^ly^ you who are most advanced in years with dear Mary who was weakly) thro [word crossed out] the late trying weather we have had, your prosperity continues a help to enliven me, who am often in a barren land in a spiritual sense, yet at times a little hope arises that a more comfortable supply may be granted, if we can but keep the mind chaste & constant in times of sensible withdrawing of Divine favour. [word crossed out] My mind is indeed often turned to take a view of the end of all things here, & to consider that our days are but few, when compared with Eternity; & that it is only during those few fle^e^ting moments that we can do any thing to further the Cause of righteousness in the Earth, & under this view my spirit is sometimes distressed with gloomy apprehensions concerning myself, lest my days work should not go forward with the day, & lest when I am to be weighted in the ballance [sic] I should be found wanting, I think a degree of anguish seizes my spirit on this account; & at seasons my fervent petition is, to be made what the Lord would have me to be, & to furnish me with ability for victory over my spiritual Enemies, & my mind is brought very near to you there, even to wish to visit you, & receive a little satisfaction in your Society; we know not how short a time we may be here, may my spirit be so purified as to associate with yours forever. I hope our dear Sally will be strengthened to go forward, & no doubt as she keeps truely [sic] dependant & obedient to the great Shepperd [sci], who has put forth, that he will go before, & continue to qualify for his own Work, dear E. Pim continues at times to bear testimony in publick meetings, last time I think she said, An Enemy she believed was near, & exhorted ^us^ to get to the posts assigned us. I was about the same time inwardly engaged to desire, that the designs of a malicious Enemy might be defeated.
26        The other side I scribbled over after meeting yesterday, & was between two minds whether to send it or not, it is such a scrawl, I suppose I need not give you any information respecting Cork, or our relations there, as you have a correspondence there yourselves, the Quarterly meeting is put off a week, on account of the great floods there, & is has been proposed to hold it here, but it does not look as if the Change would be complied with by Cork friends.
        Poor dear Sally Haughton, my very dear love is to her, I could desire it was possible for me to sit by her now, I well remember how my mind was engaged in a meeting at Ballitore on hers [sic] & dear Debbys account, (the time Abraham & Anne were with me there) I went into their house after meeting, but had not strength to communicate any of my feelings to them, I remember it since with satisfaction, believing they & their dear sister Hannah are under the special care of the best friend, who never fails those who trust in him, but they experience, that when their flesh & ^their heart^ strength faileth, the Lord is the strength of their heart, & their portion for ever.
        My dear friend E: Pikes answer to thee is truely reviving to me, to be so near to such as she does feels [sic] encouraging, & I love to find I can love (in the newness of life) such a choice spirit. Dear Abrahams addition to thy letter was also very pleasant.
        Our dear love attends you all, & remain thy affectionate
                Margaret Grubb
