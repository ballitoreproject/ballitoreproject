Mr Ardent's family consisted of a maiden
sister, 3 sons & 2 daughters - Miss Ardent
was extremely attentive, wishing to fill up all
our time with various kinds of pleasure, & on
our return from the excursions of the day
she was all [unclear]animation[/unclear] & kindness - this
lasted very well for 3 days - on the fourth
evening small plays were proposed & [unclear]seconded[/unclear]
to our writer - on the fifth evening we were
more fastidious in our plays; & on the sixth we
found them insipid - reading was proposed - Miss
Ardent who was our prompter did not choose
tedious reading, she brought forth "a wilderness
of sweets" as she called some choice [unclear]scrips[/unclear]
they were amusing & were soon exhausted
An extensive library was not found to contain
any thing [unclear]verified[/unclear] or varied enough for Miss
Ardent - for her part she declared, she only
wished to amuse us, she was quite indifferent
what was played or was read, but if the book
was
Is not Miss Ardent
too literary & refined
a character to be introduced?

dry or tedious, she was so afraid we should
be tired; if my sister sat in her room a few
minutes Miss Ardent feared she was dull
if I retired to the shrubbery or the fields she was
afraid I found their house an insipid sort of a
place - so that we found it necessary to be on
the stretch as well as our hostess if we expected
to satisfy her - My sister [unclear][/unclear] sometime after
one & has since informed me that when nothing
surprizing is going forward Miss Ardent is extremely
dull & often pitiful nor is it even probable
she will improve because she finds it insipid to
meditate & tiresome [deletion]&[/deletion] & laborious to read any thing
truly useful - [underline]I would leave out Miss Ardent.[/underline]
I wish, [deletion]Sir[/deletion] for the concurrence of your opinion
in my neglecting opportunities of [unclear]gaining[/unclear] the above
mentioned [insertion]girls[/insertion] [unclear]ledger[/unclear] favour, [deletion]as I conceive it[/deletion]
[deletion]contrary to the eternal nature of things that[/deletion]
[deletion]extremes of [deletion][/deletion] ardour & industry[/deletion]
[deletion][unclear]millant[/unclear] produce apathy & a weariness worse[/deletion]
[deletion]than[/deletion]

idleness - & I am, Sir still more anxious
for the sanction of your judicious approbation
in the choice I have now almost concluded
upon making - In my search after [unclear][/unclear]
& beauty I have overlooked the modest virtue
of Serena, the noiseless terror of her [unclear][/unclear] did
not attract my attention, till I observed the
comfort & happiness which perpetually surround
her - I often visit her at unexpected times
& never find her either idle or in a bustle
I have seen her contented & happy [deletion]at home[/deletion] [insertion]alone[/insertion]
& at ease with her [deletion]visitors[/deletion] [insertion]friends[/insertion]. She does not
consider it necessary to be the Soul of pleasure [deletion]&[/deletion]
[insertion]the prompter[/insertion] amusement, nor the brilliant star from
which all bright influence must be borrowed
but like the moon her mild radiance is not
observed in the blaze of sunshine, yet it shed
its cheering & "useful light" at those times &
situations in which her absence would cause
utter darkness - her companions are not
intoxicated with her charms, but they are always

[unclear][/unclear] satisfied & generally pleased - She [unclear][/unclear]
them the freedom of pleasing themselves & contributes
her share to the general harmony by her approbation
& good humour - Amidst the little perplexities of
domestic life she has accustomed herself to
yield patiently to circumstances & thereby to
preserve her tranquility which is so [unclear][/unclear]
in her mind that [unclear]grater[/unclear] confusion or trouble
does not overwhelm her - she does not fulfill
her duties in order to be admired, therefore she is
happy in her retired & unseen occupations
In short dear Sir, I am persuaded that Serena
will make an excellent every day companion
you will not I hope tell me that her life is a
standing pool & that her evenness of temper
will degenerate into insipidity - No, Sir, altho she
is not violent, yet she is sufficiently animated
she is not in a hurry, but she is never inactive
& the sense of her duty to be useful will
cause her life to flow away like a clear
stream, which thou rapid [unclear][/unclear] rivers
[unclear][/unclear] away the banks what were
[unclear]tended[/unclear] as an ornament of restraint, they become [deletion][/deletion]
in their course
& far more resemble a standing pool
at the long room
than the gentle life of my Serena
Not deeming herself worthy of great Happiness or
much attention, Serena is abundantly satisfied with a
moderate portion of either & in this respect also she
contributes no inconsiderable part to the ease & satisfaction
of his companions who are inspired with the serenity
she feels, & which is visited on her clear & softened countenance
