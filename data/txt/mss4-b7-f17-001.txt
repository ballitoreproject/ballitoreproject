I have felt very uncomfortable in being so long debarred of conversing with my very
dear friend - I received thine in London, but could not compass to reply to it by the friends
from Ireland, & afterwards it was so uncertain where mine would find thee - I should be
more uneasy about one part of thy letter, did I not know thou knew me so well that thou
would excuse me for harbouring such unjust & unkind jealousy of thee, for which, though it was
but the fault & the thought of the moment, I have blamed myself as much I believe as thy
generous spirit would desire - therefore shall quit the subject = I understand thou sailed the
day I landed - as I was standing up in the boat [insertion](for air for I was very sick)[/insertion] which conveyed us to land, supported by the
hand of an obliging fellow-passenger, I saw [insertion]in[/insertion] another boat D. Bell, John Robinson & John Richardson-
I was rejoiced much indeed to see once more the face of an Irishman - I found afterwards
they had been convoying you - I was almost afraid to enquire for my dear Mary Nicholson,
tho' I heard by a friend of Shrewsbury that Jo Richardson was gone to Bath, & that she was
living.- which from my dreaming so often she was no more I feared was not the case—
How often, & with how much tenderness she has had place in my thought I shall not
say - Do tell her, if thou canst, how dear she is to me, & how sincerely I wish to see her restored
to health & her friends again — the accounts we have of her state of mind are truly comfortable
I hope at any rate she & you will have the portion which sweetens the cup of gall . . I beg,
if not encroaching too much on thy time, or almost whether or not, a line to inform
how she, & in short how you all bore the sea-(a sickness I felt severely returning home) &
how you are - I am afraid thy health suffers more by fatigue & anxiety than the
voyage & will be of service to it; & I beg thou wilt not be too inattentive to it. On any
other occasion I believe thou would greatly enjoy a trip to England, & be delighted with
the cultivated beauties of the land — I was so — To give thee a rough [deletion]draft[/deletion] [insertion]sketch[/insertion] of my little tour
I shall begin with telling thee that Father, James Leeky & I sailed from Dublin the 25/5 mo
& landed in Liverpool pretty timely 27th. I suffered little with sickness, but lay in bed &
slept most of the time — We took the Coach the same day we landed, a young man of Liverpool
joining our party; & after travelling two days & two nights arrived at London - I very soon recovered
the fatigue of the journey — thou heard to be sure of the establishment of a Yearly women's-meeting
it was a memorable time — I could have no idea of such a body of friends as I saw there, &
many who had visited this nation - ten ministring friends from America - a noble port! I
be-

became acquainted with A: Taverner's friend Betsy West - a sweet creature — By the way - Anna is to
come shortly to lodge again at Cousin Jonathan's I hear. In & about London we spent 3 weeks,
a few agreeable days with dear Sarah Pim at Tottenham, & a few more with Edmund Burke
I cannot refrain breaking out a little on this subject - for I was never as struck with any one - no
wonder! for I never saw such a man before - his cordial reception of us, his affectionate treatment
to be sure endeared him mightily to me - but I was at once taken with the uncommon
grace & beauty of his person, the inimitable charm of his conversation & the mixture of native
dignity & perfect easy politeness in his manners - yet nothing (except when I saw him making
pills for the sick poor with his own hands) did I more admire in this wondrous man than
the noble simplicity which clothed his other accomplishments - I cannot describe [insertion]it[/insertion] but to find
it in a person of such extraordinary abilities is a most pleasing surprize - his amiable
wife, his accomplished Son, his facetious brother & his beautiful [unclear]seat[/unclear] are all worthy of
him - there was there for his health Capt: King who was with Capt: Cook on his expeditions
& has wrote the third volume of his voyages - Capt: [unclear]Nayle[/unclear] a young-man in
voice, look & manner exceeding like Mansergh - & who leaped overboard to save his friend
from the jaws of Sharks, was there also - & we had for a while Richd. Champion late of
Bristol - a man pleasing, polite, grave & sensible - tho' he has left friends. Edmund
Burke sent his chaise with my father & me to see Windsor of which books give thee a
better idea than I can - also to see [insertion]Cleveland[/insertion] Lord Inchiquin's seat built by the Duke of Buckingham
where yet remain "Cleveland's proud alcove
"The bower of wanton Shrewsbury & love." a dismal cold dark place
I do love this man - so must every one I should [insertion]think[/insertion] who know him - I felt a great deal when
I parted him - I feel as if I belonged to him - he behaved to me as if I did - but I leave him
I leave London - her "streets of palaces & walks of state" - I leave it with an idea of its vastness
which increases proportionably as I see every other place fall so far short of it. We had
dear Betsy Pim with us to Ackworth - of that wonderful seminary thou art much in the
way of hearing more than I can tell - From thence to the Quarterly meeting of York, but
poor Betsy Pim was taken very ill with her old complaint & prevented thereby from attending
the meetings - her complaint had so much the appearance of thine that I copied
her recipes, but must shew them to Dr. Bell when I have opportunity for his approbation
This meeting was very large - I was now got into the land of my Fathers, & saw more
cousins I believe than I have in Ireland. Dear Cousin Morris & Sally Birkbeck, who are
removed to Yorkshire, but not yet settled in their own house - I saw, & their son, an amiable
youth.

youth - We went to Foston, Cousin Robt. Grubb's, where we staid near two weeks; had the
company of Benny Wilson, the lad who was convinced at school at Leeds; & also that of
how Tom [unclear]Pim[/unclear] for some time - Tom is quite the Yorkshire man, & has made wondrous
proficiency in the dialect. I spent a few days with my cousins at Selby, & was met
at Leeds by my Father, Betsy Pim & Nancy Sparkes - we staid a few days here, enjoying
the company of some near relations & of Pim Nevins - Leeds is a fine town & very busy -
Betsy Pim returned to York, & Father Nancy & I went to Manchester - a beautiful town
where we spent some days at John Routh's who[insertion]se[/insertion] valuable sister Sarah Taylor keeps house
for him - then taking Buxton in our way, seeing the baths & Poole's-hole, we spent a day
at Leek at Joshua Strangman's, got acquainted with Frances Dodshon here as we did with
John Thorp at Manchester - & proceeded to Colebrook Dale to end & crown our visits -
hereabouts we remained near two weeks: it is a place replete with wonders, whether
we consider the vast iron works carried on here, or it's romantick situatin - the soil
abounding with curious fossils &c - or Abrah Darby, a very princess, her sweet family
& her beautiful dwelling - Now in good earnest we took our leave of England, & at [unclear]Shresbury[/unclear]
once more entered the stage, having travelled in chaises from London [unclear][/unclear]
designed we should travel all night, yet we rattled over the Welch hills till one in the
morning before we reached Conway whose Castle is a fine ruin - Penmennawr next
day was a fine object, & in the afternoon we reach'd Holyhead, where we staid a day
& had a rough, sick passage of about 15 hours over - It was a favour to find our friends
well - we came home next day, most of our family were at Moat - thou may think it
was a pleasant meeting, I suppose thou heard that poor, honest Henry Fletcher was
robbed the night my father & I left home - he never recover'd the cold & fright I believed
& expired after a lingering illness a few days ago - he was buried by his own desire
in our grave-yard & Mary Ridgway who happened that day to come to see her sister
was at the funeral & had remarkable service - I suppose H. Bevington & S: Stephenson
visited him - thou would pity his widow. We hear Thos. Ross is landed in Cork with
a Bristol friend & bravely - also that Eben: Pike is much better - Thy friends here are pretty
well Sally Haughton has been much relieved of the tooth-ache by a blister behind her ear
We hear this night that poor little Betsy Chandler has got the small-pox - Mehetabel
Jenkins I suppose is landed - Think of Tom Fayle at last - who need despair? Sally, the
only one of our family who knows I write [deletion]prose[/deletion] joins me in dear love to dear Mary, her aunt
&c
