Waterford 4th Fifthmonth 1786
My Dear Molly
I have at length got the Packet
thou expected from England which Susan Nevins is kind
enough to take charge of - I could not hear of any one
travelling in a Carriage who might be likely to call at
Ballitore so that I suppose thou may receive it in Dublin
Please advise me if it arrive safe. I would thank thee
to inform me at some time if you had any Account from
my Father lately as I perceive with astonishment & concern
his death announced in the Publick Papers after a tedious
illness - I should have supposed if he had not been
taken off suddenly that I might have been indulged with
an opportunity of shewing my tenderness & respect for him
I still had hopes that I might have it in my power
one day to renew a link that was in a manner broken
but now thou hopes are no more - I know not what
new connexions he had formed since I left Dublin or
what

what Family he may have left behind him - Perhaps my
Uncle would cause an inquiry to be made while he continues
in Dublin - I think he lived at No 26 Mabbot
Street - I believe my poor Father had too large an heart
to be a great economist so that I am not without apprehensions
that the profits of his business were scarce
sufficient to prevent his contracting debts
Please present me affectionately to Uncle & Aunt, Cousins
& all Friends who inquire for
Thine William Rayner
