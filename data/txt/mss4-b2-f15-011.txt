 
C.Dale 1st month 26th 1791
 
                It was truly cordial to me - to receive thy very affectionate letter my Dear Friend and Father in the Truth - which reachd my hands when engaged in a family visit in Sheffield accompanied by my Endcard Companion R Young in which many deep baptisms was our portion through which - and the remaining part of our visit into Yorkshire - we was mercifully sustaind so as to return in peace - the 19th of this month accompanied by our Dear Friends Henry and Ann Juke - & David Priestman who after spending a few days with us to our comfort - are now gone to visit Wales - accompanied by our Dear S Appleby - the two first are likely to pay you a Religious visit - and being precious plants - to whom some of our spirits are sweetly united in gospel fellowship - we shall feel solecitous for their help & preservation every way - & I doubt not thou my Dear Friend being to them a wise & tender Father - while amongst you 
                Thou obliged me much by thy particular account of many of my Valued Friends - especially thy own family - who are become near Relations in the most exalted fellowship - I admire your wisdom - in preferring the dew of Heaven - to the fatness of the Earth - I mean in Dear Marys connections - & there is no doubt - but the promiss will be abundantly fulfild - that those that trust seek gods Kingdom - & the righteousness thereof - shall have all things needful added  please to convey a portion of best Love to William & Mary - & tell them - I wish the choisest of blessings to descend upon them - that now enterd into the cares of Life - they may not choake the heavenly seed - but that it grow up - a plant of renown - to the praise of the Great Husbandman -
                My RY and myself was also made thy debtors by a letter - conveying a fresh proofe of thy much valued friendship - and since my return - my Dear Sister S Darby has had another precious pledge - of thy continued notice - of her - & the rest of this family - for which we are all grateful - the varied accounts containd in it of labourers being raised up is reviving - it seems as if the removal of that Dignified humbled Servant - S Grub - had been a means of animating others to arise & espouse the same Glorious Cause - for which she had so nobly contended - please to remember me in near affection to my Beloved Sister in Gospel fellowship S Shackleton - & tell her - I hope to hear of her joining Mary Dudley in her visit to the North - she will find faithfulness to be the way to fruitfulness - and it is the will of our Heavenly Father - that she should step forward in his work - For the Harvest is plentuous but the faithful labourers few 
How far an easy allotment as to the outward may be proper to be continued to me. I know not - but at present - in this respect, it seems a time of rest - but I hope still to be remembring the afflictions of Joseph - and desire to fill up in my measure - that which remains of the afflictions of Christ -
                Mary Loyd & her Aunt Barnes - has been in this family on a visit - for 3 months past - she is often poorly in her health - and finds it difficult at times to keep in that medium of spirits - she wishes for - but I hope he that has begun the good work will carry it forward 
                My Dear Sister Rathbone is an agreable resident amongst us in this house - she has mound much but I hope she will arise and shine - for her light is come - and the glory of the Lord will arise upon her - if she is but willing to follow the Lord in the way of his Leadings - I believe she may be a useful supporter of the ark of the Covenant -          I had a late letter from my Dear E Pim - by which I find they had got through about 70 families - Oh that James Abel was but faithful - then I believe his way would be clear - to take this excellent Woman for a Companion for Life - I often mound that he should be deprivd of such a blessing

Thy Dear Son Abraham & his Lydia are often in my remembrance - what a favour that there is a prospect of a succession in the Church - Parents succeeding Children in Religious usefulness - this is greater Joy - than that of Harvest - or the encrease of Corn Wine or Oile - and this Joy is thine & thy Beloved Wifes - our Family write with me in Dear Love to you and yours - and am truly thy Sincere Friend - D. Darby
