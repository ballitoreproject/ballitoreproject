My dear Mrs Leadbeater
I am sure you will hear with great
concern of my poor dear fathers
death there was something
lay very heavy on his mind
that he could not make out
as he was deprived of his
speech from the first & as
it was something under
lock & key I will be obliged to
you to tell me [unclear][/unclear] if he
has any papers in Ballitore
or any lock up plese as
we found many keys that
we cant tell what they belong
to -
Yrs truly
[unclear]Moells[/unclear]
