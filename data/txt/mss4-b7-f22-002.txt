My Very dear old Friend/On Board Ship Grange off Chester —
since my Return home, more through Indolence, than want of dispositoin
& Inclination, but thot. I Could not well omit this Opportunity
If it were only just to manifest my affectionate Remembrance of
thee & Family — I Came on board this Vessel yesterday with the dear
Friends abt. to Return to your Land. M.R. & J.H., as they Chose to go
on board at Philada., we got well down here in the Night, & Expect
Saml. [unclear]Emlen[/unclear] & S. Harrison down this morning, whether they will
all Land in Ireland Cant say, If they do, have no doubt they will
be a Comfort to many, & [insertion]they[/insertion] Can Inform thee of more than a Very Long
Letter from me could do in therefore I Shall only Just mention in
General terms - Respecting my Self I got well home, have been Comfortable
Peaceful & easy, but Poor [unclear]moagh[/unclear] - dear Geo Dillwyn has been much
more fruitful & useful in Labour & Ca. since his Return, at which I do
not Repine — the other Friends who have Latterly Visited your Land
in general pretty well I think, dear Wm. Matthews [unclear][/unclear] in peace,
of which no doubt thou has heard — I have been affected on
hearing the Loss Poor Ireland has Sustaind by the Removal of
Some of her Honourable Ancients — but on the other hand Comforted
in hearing & believing the forming hand is Laid on some of the
Rising youth, & that divers of them have been so far prevailed upon
to yield to it, as to afford a Comfortable Prospect of a Succession, &
perhaps Some of them may shine Equally Bright — the Power is
Sufficient, — Some of them are Certainly gifted with Talents & Qualifications
equal for it — be pleas'd to give my dear Love to all of this Class
tho I have hitherto neglected writing to thee

who may Remember me, & to whom thou may think it acceptable — I hear
a good account of dear James Clibborn, & of thy Sally, as well as of Others, I
hope Sally will get out a Little with S. Harrison If She Comes to your
Land — I Could name many more & say many things about Poor Ireland
for I dearly Love many there, but I neither have a Very [unclear]frentiful[/unclear] head,
Ready hand, or much time, having only Stole this, as it were, before Breakfast
as we Lay at Anchor off Chester, I thot. I felt the Current of Love
so Strong & the fresh Remembrance of thy Fatherly kindness so fresh, that
I would Say Something to thee in this way. If [unclear]Possible[/unclear] or need be to Brighton
their Chain - I did feel my Self also indebted to dear Josh. Williams
& his kind family, but have not time now to Address them in this way
therefore Request thou will Remember me affectionately to them in
Particular, & thy dear Wife, who I hear but a poor accot. of as to health
of Body, but the Treasure & Riches of her Mind I am well Satisfied abt —
dear Abraham I hope will not get [unclear]Caught[/unclear] between the Mill Stone,
nor too much Squeez'd between them & the School, I want him to be
one of those Sons who Outshine the Father — my dear Love to him
& Wife and also to dear Molly & hers &ca. - I must now Come to a Close
& beg thou will take the will for the deed for all deficiencies, thou may
be Assur'd there is none however in Regard, that Love & Union which
I trust was felt between us when nearer together in Body, & what a
Precious thing it is, that Neither distance of Place or Length of time
Can Extinguish it — I Remain with the Salutation of my
Very dear Love to thee & all the family
thy Sincere Friend —
Saml. Smith
