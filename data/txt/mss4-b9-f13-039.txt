Richmond 5th.. of 3rd month 1829. -
My dearest Sarah
It is long since we had any communication
& I now seize a flaring batchelor to the North. y'clept
Thomas Abbott who is going to be married to Huldah
Nicholson, a sister of Sarah Pike's) to drop this in Du
bin. - I thinks of thee very much my dear sister, & am
anxious to know when I may expect the announcing
of a new claimant on my affections. How can we
be so unmindful of each other! & surely I am most to
blame. - I understand thou had Elith.. lately in Dublin
she too is very silent. - Ah! Sarah, [unclear]how [/unclear]much is our
birthplace stripped! - thou had the mournful satisfaction
of seeing my dear aunt, when laid on that bed
she had no cause to dread - her dying bed. - I had
a sweet letter from my dearest Deborah, which told me
much of her peaceful close, - & also a few lines from
poor Betsy, which is become, of late a most especial
favour, we differ upon [unclear]upon[/unclear] one point, in some degrees
& it appears as if this one difference is sufficient
to make us less loving to each other. - Ah our precious
mother! She - but why speak of her - her peer is I do
believe not on this living earth. I wish I could show
thee my blooming flock. - Willie has cut two teeth &
is a fine [unclear]brave[/unclear] boy. - he is not like Susy, but blue
eyed & a Fisher all out. they are all stout & hearty
I hope thine are so - particularly poor Maj. I know
nothing of you. I am to have the Book Society meeting

here this evening & have hardly time to get out
this much. - Alas! for that purified creature
Hannah Pim - you must all feel bad at
the thought of losing her, even though only your
companion, during the time set apart for
divine worship. Her illness casts a shade over us even
here - the mother of five little girls, to our mortal
vision appears to be a dreadful loss to these but
we know not what is best. - My dear love is to Edwrd
we never hear a word about him. - I do not like
to think that our minds should be apparently
as [unclear]widly[/unclear] separated as our bodies. I have been expecting
a letter from Eliza this some time past, my
dear love to her. Yes indeed I was truly rejoiced
to hear of Sally Fayle's agreeable prospects. It was
from Josiah Gough I heard of Frank & Lucy.
Josiah is growing more agreeable as he opens
out - he was first a worm, is now a chrysalis
& will I doubt not soon burst out a complete
& brilliant butterfly. - to be sure he is basking himself
in the sunshine of Ben Fisher's daughters. -
I have received the money from my honest aunt
Harvey for the candles & am only waiting
to complete the sum of my debt that I may
send a bank order. - my aunt is in raptures
with them - dear woman! She was very poorly

all last week with bile & neroussuss - but
she is now something better. - I wish thou
wert acquainted with her. Ah! when shall
I have the pleasure my dearest Sarah
of seeing thee here. - I would thank thee
to go to the shop where thou bought thy rock
spun shawl when I was with thee & buy
for me a Canton crape one which they
showed me price 30/- the colour of rock
spun silk, - a real Canton crape. - if
they still have it or a similar one. -
I am tormented about my
blue one when I ware
it at meeting, so I have
to provide another before
the coming season - & think perhaps it
will be cheaper this season. - I was quite
matched in the combs, for which thou
hast my thanks. - Thomas Abbott lodges
at the Doyles's & will bring me any
parcel or letters. Company & unexpected
to dinner makes me hurry
to say farewell most afftitely
thy L J Fisher
