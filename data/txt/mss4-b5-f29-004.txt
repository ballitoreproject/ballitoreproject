As I found by the few lines my dear Molly favoured me with
in Dublin, she was so goodnatured to excuse my long silence, I
thought I should ill requite such kindness did I not take the
first opportunity of sending thee a letter. I intended to have
written from Dublin but thou know's & stranger is so taken up,
visiting their acquaintance [deletion]th[/deletion] and seeing the city that they have
much time for writing, I am endeavouring to plead my excuse
this way but I believe if laziness had not been in the way I might
have got time. However as I think it is better late than
never I am now sat down to write thee a scrawl, & I am afraid
as it is growing late I will not have time [insertion]to write[/insertion] much.
Now let me proceed to give thee a history of our journey
home. We left Dublin on sixth day morning between seven &
eight in the Dundalk stage the company were John Gough
My Unkle Jimmy, Aunt Lucy, My Grandfather & Mother &
self; We dined at [unclear]Drogheda[/unclear] [unclear]got[/unclear] to Dundalk to [unclear]ta[/unclear]

My Grandfather Mother & I set off next morning on horseback
the rest in chaise got to Newry about nine o'clock very
wet, it having rained most of the way, we then dried ourselves
eat our breakfasts, mounted our horses, & arrived at Hranmon
to Dinner where we were joyfully received, I had the pleasure
of meeting at the door my dear cousin Nancy Sinton
whom thou hast often heard one spake of. Next day we
went to Lurgan it being the Men & Womens meeting; second
day morning I visited most of my Friends at Moyallon
& drank tea there next day, thou sees I have not a mind to
settle at home yet, on sixth day we went to Lisburn to the
Quarterly meeting well all this won't satisfy me for I must
go to Moyallon again very soon I also took a walk up to
see Joe Richardsons house 'tis indeed a noble building I think
our house looks very little beside it, I wish he may get an agreeable
mistress for it. I think it is now time to say
something about my Brother John I was very sorry to part
with him tho' he gave me so little of his company when I
was

at Ballitore, I hope to see him at home next summer, how
is he? I was concerned that I did not get to take leave
of thy Father Mother & Sister before they left Dublin.
I received the verses & have got coppies taken of them. I have
not had an opportunity of sending them to Molly Greer
[deletion]yet[/deletion] but I believe will soon, her father has not left Dublin
yet. We are all pretty well [unclear]thad[/unclear] mercy my Mother
had a little cold [unclear]ring[/unclear] home but has got pretty well
had a little cold going home but has got pretty well
had a little cold [unclear]ing[/unclear] home but has got pr[deletion]e[/deletion]etty well
again, My love attends every brach of your family with
which I shall conclude hoping thoult not take example
by me but write soon, tho' I own I don't deserve it. farewell
Molly's love to John.
my dear cousin's very affectionate
Margaret Christy
