Ballitore 13th of 2nd month 1823.
With the pen that I signed thy paper which
exiles me from Ballitore I tell the that thy
sister LJL is no more but that she still exsists
& has gained thee an affectionate brother.
My beloved Sarah farewell I hope soon to write
to thee more fully from my new home.
Many thanks for thy gift - it loses nothing in
value from thy comparing it to thyself - I
think it uncommonly handsome.
I wished to tell thee myself & to be the first
to tell thee that I am thy affectionate sister
Deborah is here & is much better.
She talks of seeing thee next week.
Thou art the first to whom I wrote this name
Sally Fisher is a sweet creature & very pretty
though she resembles Thomas - She is but nine
months older than our Hannah White
[underline]L J Fisher [/underline]
