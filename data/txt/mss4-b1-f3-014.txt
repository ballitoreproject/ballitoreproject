P. 58.	A.S. (69) to his Grand-daughters Deborah & Margaret
							“Ballitore, 4th of Ninthmonth, 1765.
	Dear Children,
		Peggy’s letter to your father of 2nd Current is before me; and it is pleasing ot hear of your health and welfare, and will ever be so to us. I have been too-much hurried with building up a part of my house, and live in fear of losing the sweet communion inwardly with my Maker, which is by far the best treasure; being the help afforded, mercifully, to us poor, short-lived mortals, for a preparation for a never-ending eternity. You know this, my dear children, and I hope are not unmindful of this most important point. Early piety, you have heard, is acceptable to God. Be sure, with all your getting learning, neglect not diligently to look for that fear which keeps the heart clean.
									A.S.
