[insertion]x[/insertion] 20th. Ellen called this morning to ask me
to go shopping with her, but could not as
Charlie and I were going to the cattle show.
I went and met Papa and Mama
there - saw [underline]such[/underline] a collection of fowls
[extra line]
and [extra [underline]such[/underline] a line] - and no
and heard [underline]such[/underline] a din - and no
wonder, when every cock in the place
seemed to be crowing with all its might,
apparently trying to out crow his neighbour
Saw some ducks, nearly as large as geese,
We afterwards paid the cattle a visit

made my exit. Where were the heifers
but in the picture gallery-! ! and

the fine central hall - adorned with the

trying to get all the good they could

take it down; the case I suppose.

Aunt Liddy and Debbie C. Papa and
Mama went out to dinner to Trafalgar
Terrace, so Charlie and I had ours
