My dear Margaret
I am obliged for the
loan of your book - &
I marked on separate
bits of paper dates &c
missing in the page I
put each bit of paper
that you might make
them yourself - that
Mary Annee Mauly who
married Thomas Haughton
as far as I know
did not marry twice
it was her daughter
Deborah who did

but I will find out for certain
I have no mention at
all of an [underline]Isaac[/underline] Manly
in my pedigree of wh.
I send you a copy that
you may keep with my
love - in it you will see
the different branches
that yours all came
in. - I hope you will find
[underline]the way[/underline] I have drawn
it out clear to your
mind.
Can you tell me any thing
about Deborah Gee [unclear]Nea[/unclear]
Jellicoe. who married Joseph
Mauley. at head of my
pedigree.?

When did Deborah Manly
n√®e White die. I mean
what year? I have her
death cut out of the
paper by Aunt Eli
"22 Jan 7 at [unclear]Minaretores[/unclear]
wife of Joshua Manly" &c
Did you ever hear any thing
of the Jacksons of the
Comb. & Isaac Jackson
who married Miss Watson
& went to America
I want to know did he
leave any sons in this
country? .
Can you tell me who
Ally Jackson is was he
[unclear]not[/unclear] a preacher in the
socitey of Friends I believe

he is not alone now is he?
[unclear]Do[/unclear] you know what year
Alexander Barrington died
Elizth's Brother & [unclear]Acnce[/unclear] Cook's
husband. I thought [unclear]Henry[/unclear]
Allen could [insertion]tell me[/insertion] but he forgets
I have no account in my
Barrington pedigree of the descendants
of Nicholas Barrington
5 son of Nicholas Barrington
& Mary Bancroft - they
are living in the County
Wexford - this I judge [unclear]few[/unclear]
deaths & marriages I
 have read in the newspapers - 
John Barrington of
Riversfeed [insertion]Wexford[/insertion] son of the
late Nicholas Barrington
