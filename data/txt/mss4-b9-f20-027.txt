20th of 10th mo. 1828
My dear E - It is almost time for me to answer
thee thou might give my nurse her money
from the 10th of 5th mo that will be about
a month after what I gave her if she would
rather have 10s/ at once perhaps it would be
best to give it her & thou need not promise
her more unless thou thinks she wants
it [insertion]for[/insertion] herself I mean in nourishment or clothes
I am very lonely after Lydia , Thy accounts
of Willy are very pleasant, I hear
Betty Pim did not appear yet the [unclear]stairrods[/unclear]
were very cheap
