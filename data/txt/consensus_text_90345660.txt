[deletion]Friday[/deletion] we stopped a the forge and
while the smith was performing
his office, I called upon Sally and
Elizabeth who thought I had dropped
from the skys, and opened their
eyes in astonishment. - They were
very glad to see me and Sally
showed me their little garden which
was very nice and gay -
After dinner we took a very pleasant
walk and paid a visit to a Mrs
Wayfield or Wafield whom they
invited here - for some future evening
After tea worked, chatted, and read
Friday - Very fine - Went to Ballytore
Aunt Ellen, Miss Holland, and Isabel
and Aygy drove in the phaeton
while I rode on Oaklands -
We first went to Griesemount but
found no one at home except the
junior members of the family -
Poor Margt had not been so well
lately and could only see Isabel -
