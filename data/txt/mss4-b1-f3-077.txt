	My dear Margaret
		I received thine of the 18th, at my return from the quarterly meeting of Mountmellick. That meeting was large, and I think, as to instrumental help, favoured. James Gough and Mary Ridgway [sic] had, in my apprehension, good times. What a wonderful blessing to the church is a living ministry! and how precious a thing and admirable it is for a human creature to be qualified to speak in the name of the Lord! and for human nature to be influenced by a supernatural power! The frequency of such appearances among us, like those of the sun, moon, and stars, and the process of vegetation, by the familiarity, takes of [sic] from the astonishment; but still, great and marvellous are the works of the Almighty.
