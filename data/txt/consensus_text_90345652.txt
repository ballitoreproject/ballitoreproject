Who should we see also but Kate
[unclear]Branly[/unclear] and her brother, who at
first appeared rather out of their
element amongst so many friends
- Tea first, then a promenade
in the large round room, while
the tables were clearing, back
again to the same apartment
to hear the accompllished lecturer
who delighted her numerous
audience by her charming eloquence
and If they did not derive benefit
from her discourse, it certainly
was their own fault -
We three girls escorted by Philip
returned to Fassaroe by the last
train - Richard went out to
his lodgings at Rathmines, and
Patrick staid at Britain St with
Charlie -
10 Sunday - I went to meeting with
Papa and Mama, Lyd staid at
home and Isabel went to Powerscourt
church - with Philip as an escort.
