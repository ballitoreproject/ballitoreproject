Charlie, but no Charlie appeared and
John heard by Telegraph that it was so
stormy on Tuesday night - they were
tossing about for 18 hours and had
to put in at Holyhead - instead of going
on to Liverpool, and even did not reach
it until 2 Oc next day - We heard
of the wreck of the Royal Charter, most
dismal it was - just at the very threshold
of their homes - more than 400 on board
oh it was inexpressibly sad -!
It is a relief to us to know Charlie was safe
for during that fearful gale numbers of vessels
were wrecked. Came out again with Papa
28. Friday - It is settled that Margt and
Charlie go with Lyd on Monday next
29 . Saturday - A beautiful but cold day
Went to town again to change shawl for
Lyd, and to leave a note for Charlie -
Lyd and to leave a note for Charlie -
Aunt Eliza kindly came with me, and
on finishing my shopping I parted with
her and called on Ellen as I had about
1/2 an hour to spare before going to train
Â½ an hour to spare before going to train
Ellen accompanied me to it. I came out by
1 Oc on Kingstown line -
Rest of evening busy helping to settle
October 1859 -
