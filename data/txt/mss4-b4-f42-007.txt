My dear Mother,
I thought to have sat down quietly &
conversed with thee this day, but have been occupied since
morning with one family engagement or other (being 7th day)
occupations which seem trifling , & yet appear necessary,
now the prank is come from the bridge, & part 8 o'clock
I thought I could not but stuff a line or two into it, I
enjoyed the thought of writing to thee & yet how am I hindered?
I find by a letter from you that thou art left at
home thro' indisposition, which was unpleasing tidings, as
I think a little journey might be serviceable to thee in a
two fold respect, helping to strengthen, set free, & invigorate
both Body & mind, I often sympathize with
thee in thy having a pretty large share of care still to
encountre, but I hope thy mind is supported in quietness
even in the bustles of this Life, under a consciousness
of upright walking & a devoted heart, & that he that
has been the morning light will be the evening [underline]Song[/underline]
I believe thou heard we were favoured to get well
home from Cork, & found our families pretty well only
poor little Eliza has her complaints still, a sore eye
&

& cough. I had satisfaction in attending this meeting
my Brother's company not a little contributed thereto.
I cannot say I always felt the spring of consolation
bubble up as would be desirable, especially to the thirsty
travailers, but thought it a favour to feel my
mind mostly preserved in a waiting, quiet frame,
& at times I thought permitted to draw a little
water as out of the Noise of the Archers, for
both withen & without we are sometimes annoyed
both within & without we are sometimes annoyed
by this cunning Archer, who labours diligently to
destroy our peace, but under the Banner of the
Prince of peace we are protected from his
assaults, & enabled to ascribe the strength, &
the power to him, & not to ourselves.
They say the post will soon go out; -
Molly seems pretty well, tho looks a little thin,

a young Man came with us from Cork, one
Ledbeter, & is still with us, I suppose thou knows
him being an old pupil at Ballitore.
