Clonmel 22nd of 10 mo. 1790.
Well my dearest Mary, where art thou now, or
what is become of thee, shall I hear no more of thee? excuse
me that I resume this complaint, for I really have
been uneasy about thee lest thou art not well or easy
in thy mind, for thou wd. not I believe wilfully give
me pain in any respect, sure if thou did not get my
letters itself where wd. be the great harm in writing
a few lines. Dost [underline]thou[/underline] think it not right? Well
now dont be displeased at me or any way unsettled
for what I have said, this night's post may relieve me
a good deal, I am not as well as I was I think -
The way I spend my time mostly is, in the morning
when I can get out I [deletion]mostly[/deletion] go to the Corn office
where the Wheat is bought & pd. for, & do be striving
to comprehend the method of their keeping
but they have so many books & so much bu[unclear][/unclear]
that it is really puzzling [underline]to me[/underline] to come at any
knowledge of the right method - after Breakfast
to Rathronane Mill, & after Dinner to Thos. Grubbs
Mill or to the Corn Office again, When will it
be time for me to leave this, I may be as ignorant
in another week as I am now - I think if the business
was going on in Ballitore I could learn more
in a week there than [insertion]in[/insertion] 2 here, for then one wd. see
what they had to do & could adopt one regular plan
but here there is different methods, & one cant make free
enough to be employed in any office, only just to walk
about & look on, & every one seems to have enough to do
of their own & so I am left to do as well as I can - Did
thou hear from or write to Mary Pim, I am just after
writing a few lines to Anne Shannon in Sally's letter, so I -
return
