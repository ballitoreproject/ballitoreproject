Anner Mills 10th 12th month
My dear friend,
I have daily reproached myself
for not addressing thee, & really it was not doing
justice to my feelings, which were afresh drawn
in near love to thee on our very short interview
as we passed the attractive spot. Thy precious
Elizabeth kindly sent me a parcel about ten days
since by which we learned that she was at
last restored to you. it was truly pleasant to us
that the time we spent in [unclear]Leinburn[/unclear] made [unclear]part[/unclear]
of her visit. thereby my [unclear]Jane[/unclear] had the gratification
of a good deal of her society. & I came in for a little
but circumstances combined to keep me a prisoner
during the fine weather. I often take a retrospective
view of poor dear Mary - her sweet babes & their
kind friend Elizabeth - now how many great matters
have accrued since I was so kindly cared
for by thee & thine. An eventful year now about
to close & we seem threatened with [unclear]intrusive[/unclear]
war. So that whoever lives another year may
witness many trying scenes. surely we have
nothing to trust too - but an [unclear]Over[/unclear] Providence
for vain is the help of Man - even if we had that help
1821

in this country - we never seemed so bereft of
outward means of security dear Richard Jordan
in this parlour - when speaking of future horibles
said. that he saw as a sheep in the midst of
wolves. he then supplicated for our preservation.
happy for those who can look to the good Shepherd
with a consciousness of having know[insertion]n[/insertion] [underline]His voice[/underline]
(and [underline]followed it.[/underline] and not a strangers. but many
many of us have been taken Captive by the
Prince of the world. and as we have served him
too much. we cannot expect but that a longsuffering
Being may "Mock when our fear cometh"
this neighbourhood is disturbed by the nightly
excursions of the barbarous natives & my feebleness
of body & mind grieves me because when
awoke by shots my nerves became so agitated that
I seem unable to mind myself. When I aught to be
a protector to the little ones committed to my
charges. we were reading Bishop [unclear][/unclear] prophecy
last evening - and many evenings haas been in
Mercy permitted. [unclear][/unclear]th day brought us a long and
unexpected letter from my dear Aunt Abigail
she fancied herself better & that her friends thought
she looked so. her mind is evidently in a preparing
state. She mentions Sarah Darby's quick dissolution

and her feeling so much sympathy with her
friends at Coalbrookdale as induced her to address
Rebecca [insertion]Darby[/insertion] - These exertions however proved too
much for her weak frame - she was very poorly
for some days - this morning of [insertion]brought[/insertion] tidings from my
Aunt Hannah who thinks that this precious
relative is not likely to continue long in Mutability.
Betsy Misser was much favoured
in her dying moments and Anne Copper
bore her extreme and protracted sufferings
with Christian patience. John Barclay has
been in London for advice. his amiable wife
the Physicians apprehend has a lung complaint
which alarms them. we do[insertion] not[/insertion] hear what the boy
is or is to be. Anna [unclear]Foirtes[/unclear] has [insertion]family visiting[/insertion] been labouring
in her good Masters service. Martha Savory is
spending the winter at Congenies. she is represented
as feeling the awfulness of her minion. Worthy
Thomas Shillitoe instead of moving homewards
as he had expected - is turned to Stavenger in
Norway. his services have been acceptable
and edifying in many places. thus we
see how the weak are made strong through Faith

thy old friend Betty Grubb again. her case is
one of the few enlivening occurrences of the
present days. our dear Aunt Margaret spent nearly
a week with us lately much to our comfort
save that it is trying to see that she suffers as much
with her breathing. old age or rather decline is very
obvious. I saw a considerable change on my return
from the North. she is better with Margaret than
Elizabeth who seemed more of charge than help
Deborah suffers with sick stomach. the boy is
teething. now I must tell thee about our fine
fellow. I found him running very stoutly
alone. his cap off nice curly hair and four
teeth and as fat and fair as perhaps any baby
thou ever saw. he was not then 11 months old
my dear faithful Sarah had great comfort
in resigning her charge to me. all in good health
she & I assume Jacob were liberated to attend
the Quarterly Meeting. whither my Mother her
attendant Mary Good & my Sister Rebecca
were bound. the latter went to Dunmore
& after spending three weeks pleasantly there
[deletion]has[/deletion] paid visits to her friends in Waterford
