of him: or to this purpose. I thought this visit did
me more good than any thing else, I had faith to believe
in what this favoured servant delivered. I slept well
that might, & mended apace ever since: the child seems
to thrive, & is mostly quiet, it is a small child, rather
long limbed: the other children in health at present, as is
my Husband, & Mother tolerably for her to be. I have written
so much upon a worthless subject, I mean on myself, that I
am almost ashamed of it, but relying on the strength of
your affection for me, which naturally leads to a minute
enquiry I shall send it, hoping that you will impute this
profuse detail to a desire of informing you in what you are
interested about, more than from a pleasure I take in
dwelling on the subject of myself.
Poor Molly Dudley was delivered of (they tell me) a
surprising big Boy last fifth day evening about 8 o'clock
in the evening, she had a shocking time of it, as bad
as at the last I suppose from 3 o'clock afternoon, so that
the Doctor apprehended he could not avoid destroying the
child

Child; Molly has been very weakly since, cannot set
up; & the child had fits, so that they expected him to
go off, but now they have hopes of his life, his size
I suppose contributed much to poor Molly's suffering.
I was much concerned to her [insertion]a[/insertion] of John Watson's decease,
& also of poor Robert's being in a Putrid fever, & not
expected by John Davis to recover; what a melancholy
moving catastrophe would this be, for the two Brother's to
go off together, & leave behind them their two disconsolate
Widows, & deeply afflicted surviving sister.
such alarms to us who remain are awful indeed.
 I never scarcely hear any thing of Cousin Jenny
Fuller, is she at home now, how is she & the family?
my dear love is to them, & to Cousin Jonathan & family
I wrote to Debby & Sally, but neither of them gave me
a line in return not so much as to say they received it.
My Husband unites in duty to Father & thee, & dear love
to you all. Abram wanted me to write a letter to his
Grandfather, to tell [insertion]him[/insertion] he was obliged to him for the pretty
little book he sent him; Anne saw a letter from her
grand father
Grandfather, she asked. Did he send his love to me".
I am your affectionate
Margt Grubb
