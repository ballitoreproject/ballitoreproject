Douglass - Isle of Man
July 8th 1856
My dear Mamma
Lest you might
be any way uneasy about
us I just write a line
to tell you that we are
still here, & as the weather
has been rather rough
it all depends on circumstances
whether we leave

this to-morrow or not -
Last night was very high
wind here, and we
were very glad to be
safe in harbour, if tomorrow
should be fit
(but of course not else)
we think of going to Ramsey
on this Island, on our
way to Larne, but I
suppose we will only
stay perhaps a night
there - I hope to get
our letters at Larne -
we drove to Peel today
to show Richard the
old Castle there, the day
was very cold -
With dear love to all
in haste your much
 attached MJB - 
we are all well -
& hope you are all so too -
