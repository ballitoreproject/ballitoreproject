My dear cousin,
        I was just setting about making some reply to thy last kind ^acceptable^ letter, when I was interrupted & put off it I am [sic] now ^seated^ again for that purpose, not having any store of materials that I know of, but desirous to keep alive in this manner the communication between us  Tranquillity, & a fit disposition of mind that to converse with our friends are not always ours [sic]  there is a time & a season for every thing  & it behoves us diligently to watch the motions of life in our own minds, that we may not let slip the opportunities of receiving, or giving what may be brought to our hand for the purpose  The watchful, [illegible] servant is in a peculiar manner in his Masters favour  being ready at a call, being always prepared, he is most frequently employed, & so has most frequent access to the Masters presence. And indeed, whatever tends to increase & renew our intercourse & acquaintance with the source of all Good is sedulously to be cultivated by us  Yet, all the while, it is most certain that even the devoted & dedicated, even the willing & obedient have great need to behave themselves in the church of Christ & in the world, bringing forth such fruits, as that by them the great Lord is glorified, the just witness in the conscience of all is answered, & their own peace established. Need I say I wish this may be the happy experience of my beloved friend, as well as of myself? that so, having in meekness & simplicity walked exemplarily through life, & been enabled to do our clays work faithfully & honestly, in the pure fear, we may, according to our several measures, be accepted at the close of all, & enter into that uninterrupted, unpolluted rest, which remaineth for the people of God. [pencil note] X
        I received thy last, my dear friend, at the time of our Quarterly Meeting at Carlow, & communicated the substance of the messages contained, with which I believe the parties were well pleased  It is like thou wouldst hear from one or other that our stranger-friends were collected there  & I hope the Great Master blessed & brake the bread, in some good degree, to the hungry. There is besure a craving in the multitude after words, more than after the operative instruction [page number] 118 of the Word  there is a waiting upon the servant, & not upon the Master  which hurts and hinders the arising & spreading of a divine life, as I believe would be the case, if the reverse prevailed  So that it greatly concerns the spiritually-minded to keep each to their own exercise & travail of spirit, that the Lord may arise in power, & scatter those clouds, which often cover our religious assemblies, both for worship & discipline. It has been warmly recommended that Friends should meet in meeting-houses, where it was practicable, rather than in private houses to hold meetings for worship  This appearing on many accounts to be a salutary recommendation, & Friends of Newtown-meeting consenting to put it in practice, our last mens [sic] meeting by a record removed that particular meeting to Castledermot, & it being to be held there for the first time (18th instant) several of us from other of our little meetings attended, & I hope the alteration was owned: the meeting for worship having at the close been resolved into a meeting of conference, there seemed to be a freedom of speech on the occasion  Although when & where to meet is a point necessary to be adjusted, yet how to meet is the main object of our religious consideration  I have been twice at Rathangan side since our Quarterly meeting  the first time my son & I paid a visit to the sick & the distressed, of whom there were several there  One of them, whom we visited to our comfort, died before our return, & made (I believe) an happy exit  I mean Sally Neale. Poor Mary Forbes was gone before we went thither  Zacharias Dicks was at Isaac Jacksons, but poorly  he removed to Joseph Inmans soon after our leaving him  We also attended their monthly meeting at Edenderry  I since went to the funeral of Samuel Watsons (of Violent bank) only son  a fine, promising young man of good parts & good dispositions  sober & well-minded  his remains were brought 15th instant to the meeting of Rathangan, where Mary Ridgway had a pretty open time among the people, who behaved with remarkable solidity  I went back after the funeral to the house of mourning, & returned home next day  The parents of this young man are doubtless closely pinched by this trial, yet bear it as well as could be expected.
