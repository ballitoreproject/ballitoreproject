	Dear friend,
		Remembering with gratitude that I was in thy epistolary debt, I believe I would have wrote thee of my being favoured to get well home, &c.; but having been longer in debt to thy sister D.D, I thought best to pay off that score, & hope she communicated to thee any intelligence that my letter contained, which was worth imparting. I hope also that the event of a personal interview is no interruption, but rather a cement of our correspondence. ^[pencil] X^ I have just been re-perusing thy last kind letter, with renewed satisfaction, & wish to be preserved in such a lowly, humble state, as to preserve the unity & much valued amity of such friends. I indeed much depends on being preserved in this state, so characteristick of the Great Master. A departure from it has proved the ruin of thousands  And by how much more useful & conspicuous any become in the church, by so much more conspicuous should this spirit appear in them: This spirit, if kept to, will work wonders. It is the well-watered, well-dug, & well-cultivated soil, in which the Christian virtues grow & flourish. Alas for many in our poor society! they have chosen the barren mountains, a dry & parched soil  ^[pencil] [or]^ their roots have struck into a hard & stiff clay, & they bear neither leaves nor fruit. But the great husbandman is not unmindful of his plantation  he is sending skilful labourers into it  & not only so [page number] 297 but by his own immediate power he has reached divers, arrested them in their retrograde, wayward course, & brought them into the way everlasting. So that, 
according to my sense, there is encouragement for the faithful devoted servants to persevere, doing each his own business, & that part of the general labour which is assigned him. Some particulars may be sent on particular expeditions & services, but the discipline of the church is a general field of labour, in which no living member is exempt from a share. For my part  Ever since I became in some measure acquainted with the Truth, and mercifully arrived at some settlement in it, my relative duties in religious society, the share of the support of discipline, which I apprehended fell to my lot, has been among the capital weights & burdens & exercises & distresses of my life. As our inward frames differ one from another, so these things are harder to some dispositions than others  they have been particularly so to me. So that I could say with Job, The things that my soul refused to touch, are as my sorrowful meat. But I have lived to see a termination to many of these conflicts  I have lived to see captivity led captive, rebellious children become loyal subjects, & the opposers of Truth triumphantly bearing its standard in the sight of its enemies, their former associates. Many unfaithful professors also, whom neither gentle expostulations could win, nor repeated warnings intimidate, have been summoned before another tribunal, to receive their final sentence, & everlasting retribution, according as their works have been. O that such as now trouble the church may awake in time to a proper sense of their state, ere it be too late, while the day of visitation lasts, & a place of repentance is yet to be found; [page number] 298 for, by reason of frequent resistance, there may be a cessation of the strivings of Grace; & the poor creature left to itself, in the hour of bitter distress, may ask and ask in vain, when he from within shall answer & say, Trouble me not: the door is now shut, & my children are in bed with me in bed; I cannot rise & give thee. +++ [pencil] XX
	My dear friends at the Dale I know kindly interest themselves in the welfare of me & mine. Be so kind ^as^ to inform them that we are generally favoured with health & tranquillity here +++ I have heard of the increase of thy son and daughter Rathbone. I heartily wish them an increase in all that is good ++ I am pleased that ye have had the agreeable accession of Richard Dearmans family to the Dale. Please salute for me thy wife, & my friend Priscy Gurney  thy mother, brother & sisters, who all live in my best thoughts  dear, old Anne Summerland & Daniel Rose. I am glad you have lent Suky Appleby  I hope she will be repaid to you with usury. My wife joins me in ^true^ love & esteem for you all, known & unknown. My children bear you affectionate respect.
	I am, my dear friend, sincerely thine
		Richard Shackleton
