To Capt: P -
Cowards are cruel, but the brave
Love mercy, and delight to save.
Gay.
P-, 'tis true, & pleased I see
Courage & mercy joined in thee;
I saw in childhood's days, ere while,
Good nature form thy rosy smile
Thine artless eye beam'd honest truth,
And sweetly dawned thy rising youth.
Now manhood's fruits have offered more
Than the fair promise did before,
Amidst embattled hosts thou stood,
Yet kept thy pitying hand from blood.
Thy sword unspotted shews a mind
To peace, & not revenge, inclin'd.
Yet thou art brave - the pass thou gained
Where Death in all its terrors reigned,
Thy [deletion]generous[/deletion][insertion]valorous[/insertion] band, with minds sedate,
Prest onward through the jaws of fate;
And O, what favouring Angel spread
The sheild unseen to guard thy head?

212.
Who turned the leaden [deletion][/deletion] [insertion]deaths[/insertion] aside,
When the red field with blood was dy'd?
'Twas He who mercy loves, who made
His creatures for each others aid,
Who never bade the sword destroy,
Nor man his fellow man annoy.
O may He always guard thy life,
And lead thee from the walks of strife,
To thy fond arms again restore
The tender partner of thy love,
Give thee to clasp thy babe once more,
And every social blessing prove!
For RS's watch which had belonged to his Grandfather
Despise me not, ingenuous boy,
Nor change me for a modern toy;
Oh, think of him who wore me long,
Nor do my oft try'd merit wrong.
So may thy hour like his be past,
Then need thou never dread the last!
