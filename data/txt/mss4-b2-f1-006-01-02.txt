My dear James,
+++ There are many clouds, & many baptisms - there is water & there is fire - I apprehend this last is the dispensation under which thou hast lately been, & perhaps now art - it is an hardening of the clay by direction of the great Potter, after it has been repeatedly softened and made pliable by the plastic hand! Tis not for me to enquire why we are made so, or how we are made so - but resignedly ^to^ submit to become any thing or nothing as Infinite Wisdom shall appoint, that Wisdom which rules in the material world, which causes the showers to fall, & renews the face of the earth with vegetation; that wisdom also binds the sweet influences of Nature, & locks all up in dreary frost - But in this, as well as in that, is his almighty power & goodness exerted, who alone can uncreate, as well as create, & who has been pleased to deal marvellously with thee. May thou be favoured with strength of inward & outward constitution to bear the continued turnings of the divine hand, till it has thoroughly purified and refined thee, & made thee just that thing (let it be what it will) which the Lord would have thee to be. Only be thou pliant and submissive, behaving & quieting thyself as a child, that is weaned from the breast of consolation, at which it has often been admitted to draw, & content to be fed with such food, & at such seasons as is seen to be most convenient for it. I want thee, ^my dear James,^ to be, (what I never expect to be in any great degree) an upright, strong & steady pillar in the house - Be of good cheer, notwithstanding the weakness & warping of divers, & the numbers without weight, there is in many places a prospect of a good deal of good company for thee, a succession of hopeful youth, whom I wish to receive the law & the testimony from the Lawgiver himself, so will they have it pure & undefiled, for there is a danger of its having [page number] 216 received some mixture, some heterogeneous taint in passing through the hands of their predecessors. +++
        I lament that so little of a manifestly genuine, right birth in the line of publick service has come forth of late amongst us. But perhaps the Lord of all power & true ability is about to take the work of reformation more immediately into his own hands. Our forefathers were gathered very much by a blessing on instrumental labour. We hear now of societies collected in several untrodden places by the immediate operation of the gospel of Truth begetting a living faith in the hearts of many, and disposing them to meet together, & wait for the renewal of it's holy virtue to their minds. In your province indeed there seems to be something brought forth, which I heartily wish, if of divine original, may grow, may flourish, & overspread the land. And there is no doubt but as the creature is preserved in lowliness of heart, with the eye single to the glory of God, they who apprehend themselves thus engaged will be favoured from time to time, with a clear evidence of the nature of the ground on which they stand, & their own wise-hearted brethren will also see where they are. I understand our dear friend Samuel Neale has rather declined of late in health. I hope his days will be mercifully lengthened out - may he live to see (in a spiritual sense) his children's children & peace upon Israel.
