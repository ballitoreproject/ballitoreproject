M: S: requests W: L: [underline]not[/underline] to say any thing to Jno Taylor
about going with her, as she has concluded she believes to
stay till seventh-day, & WL is welcome to her mare to go to
Mt. rath. Thus far I wrote last night after I came up to bed, but lay too
long this morning to send it in time, as J. T: came. And now I am sorry thou has
not my mare to ride. I hope to hear how thou art before I go, being fearful thou
art not well, & riding that young horse of Jacob's I don't like for thee.

W Leadbeater.
