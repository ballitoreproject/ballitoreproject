Dublin March 3rd 1828
My dear Elizabeth
H Watsons bond is in the
hands of Chas. Fausset in order that judgement
may be entered thereon. I do not know
whether I mentioned in a former letter, that
the cost of the Bond, viz the stamp and the filling
of it was £1-10s-21/2 Perhaps should be charged
to and paid by H Watson; as you have an
summary acct with her, I suppose it may be
placed to her debit therein.
I enclose a note from Wm English
on the only int of the Earl[unclear][/unclear], the which
I have written a reply, as follows "I quite
agree with you that no time ought to be lost
and intend forwarding by tomorrows post to
[unclear]Ballitore[/unclear] your note, and to recommend to my
Sister in law to send up without delay all the
documents she possesses relative to those Concerns
that they together with those in your possession,
of agreeable to you, [unclear]he laid[/unclear] before some respectable
Attorney when I suppose she may name
in order that a four Letter may be made
out. This will at once point out the parties
who can grant a renewal or such deed or deeds
as will secure the Intent of all parties concerned."
My dear E I know of no other way
of having these matters set to rights, these
[unclear]nerde[/unclear] will also set in its time leght any
claim my aunt Sally may have. Should
the present [deletion][/deletion] life [unclear]drops[/unclear], I cannot answer

for our situation. Consult Eben and let
know if I can do anything here. This
proceeding will of course cost something
but the concerns themselves ought to pay
this Crom Wallace has found all
the rent due to you for his holdings at
the [unclear]firm[/unclear] Amtg to £16. I have not heard
a word from [unclear]Crozier[/unclear] since and suppose
I may hold what money I have to pay
as far as it will that Rent. What is
the tenants name who him got the house
next William, did the former occupant
go away in your debt, and please when
you [unclear]mits[/unclear] say the present rent to which
it is subject. Has John Doyle got possession
of the quary field. Might we trouble
you so far as to enquire of Donnelly
if she is still inclined to take the field
Richard has hence, and of so what
rent she considers it worth, no one
person can have it except with the
promise that they are to give up
as much of it as will give yards or
gardens to the row of houses when
called upon to do by us, an [insertion]proportional[/insertion] equivalent
to be allowed them in the rent for what
ever quantity of ground may be taken for
that purpose I excuse all [unclear]them[/unclear] & believe me
yours affectionately EB

Copy of Wm. English's note to EB
Dear Sir - Ths Jas Scott Malloy has return'd me some papers & & & &
all of which are documents simply relative to the Holding
I have in Earl street. In a letter written by your late
Father-in-law, a reference is made to the original Lease
which he says was in his possession The Cart renewal was
in the following names, George the 3d
Prince of Wales
&
Duke of York
of course two lives have dropt, he says in that letter
that he had paid a renewal fine I suppose George the
3d - life £8- I am to pay his Reps. 3£ late
Currency fine for each life he says further
that is is a Widow [deletion]Pallen[/deletion] Pallin who has to renew
to him & he engages to give me the same
lines as he receives himself, he [unclear]further[/unclear]
says that he believes John Wright Skinner Row
can give some information respecting that
person - I believe its best to be executive
in the affair & to get the renewals lest the
last life might drop also
