My dear friend,
I think myself quite unfit for conversing with thee, & almost wonder why I set about it  but there are some people whom I love so dearly that I am fond of being in company with them, though not expecting much interchange of verbal pledge. I gratefully acknowledge thy lines received in London; & all thy communications this way to myself or others that I am favoured with a sight of are grateful to me. But I lament thy poor state of health  I am sorry that the body does not seem able to follow the draught of the mind  Thou servest, my dear friend, no austere Master, who requireth more than he gives ability every way to perform  thou servest One whose eye penetrates into the inmost recesses of the heart, & knoweth every lodgement of every secret thought within therein  he beholds the corruptions, the imperfections, the infirmities which are there - & also his eye seeth every precious thing. Be encouraged therefore, beloved friend, to trust in him still, still to lean upon him, & look toward him. Only be dedicate [d in grey] & devoted in thy will, & leave the rest to divine ordering & disposal. + +
	Ye will have heard (belike) of the removal of our valuable friend John Davis of Cork. He had his place & service in religious society- & I doubt not his spirit has found a place of rest & peace. Death we find mows down indiscriminately all sorts & ^all^ ages. It is in the economy & ordering of Infinite Wisdom, which is above our finite comprehension, that the time of our dissolution [page number 272] is wrapped in darkness & obscurity, conveying a forcible memento, that we may be always ready  that we may not take upon us to put off till tomorrow what we can do to-day  that we may not withhold good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of our hand to do it, & say unto the moving cause of all acceptable, religious service, Go, & come again, & tomorrow I will give, when we have it by us. + + +
	I do not expect that this will reach thee at Lurgan, though I draw my bow at a venture, directing my arrow to that place: but wherever it meets with thee, or if it do not meet with thee at all, it comes from

thy unalterably affectionate friend
