Boston 11th month 7th 1783

E. Abrahams gave me the inclosed the other day to transmit to Ballitore & as I have not time to pay off an epistolary debt with it I dont like to detain it nor yet to sent it without the salutation of my dear love to my kind Friends at Ballitore hoping in a few days (for Mother comes to me next week) to make up a share of a bundle for Ballitore till then I am in tolerable good health thy truly affectionate & obliged
