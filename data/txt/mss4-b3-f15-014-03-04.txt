Ballitore 28th of 6th month 1789

My dear friend,
++ If we faithfully do, according to the ability received, what appears to be our duty, though it may appear to ourselves and to others a very little thing, we shall not want encouragement and help to go forward. A little pure gold is far more valuable than a great deal of base metal. So I wish thee, beloved friend, to be strengthened and encouraged, and to love the littleness, and not think the day of small things long.
Thou hast, I believe under right direction, put thy hand to the gospel-plough, neither look back, nor too far before thee, nor about thee at the spaciousness of the field of labour, but just turn up the furrow thou art for the time engaged in, according to the present skill & ability afforded. Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might, the present might, and may the Lord Almighty bless and prosper, and increase that might to the edification of the church, & to thy own solid peace.
	I had some agreeable, feeling conversation with dear  who seemed inwardly strengthened and supported under this fresh trial which she met with on her return home, from about three months labour in her [page number] 240 masters cause service. Let us mark the economy of divine Providence and his dealing with his faithful servants, those that leave all for the gospels sake shall receive the hundred fold (it is said) now in this time, but with persecutions - there must be the necessary alloy in this world - but, in the world to come, eternal life.
