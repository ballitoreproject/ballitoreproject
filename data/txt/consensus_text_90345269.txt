It is my nature I fear, I suppose I might
conquer it and oh! I wish I could, pride
I think is the general cause of reserve
for [unclear]were[/unclear] you not silent frequently least if
you did speak, you might be laughed
at, or [insertion]be[/insertion] unnoticed, or told you are talking
nonsense, and then your [underline]pride[/underline] is mortified,
tried, and you feel determined not to say
anything. - I have just received such
a funny letter from Polly written where
she T H and Liddy were [insertion]seated[/insertion] in a new
Corner in the garden - it is a partnership
letter and very amusing.
11th.. Philip went to town to day - he
and Papa have both come out.
12th.. Very busy to day settling my little
garden - Avy also - I believe I am
to accompany Papa to town tomorrow
& stay with Margt, as Charlie is going
down for Liddy - Papa has offered
to get Philip's [unclear]horse[/unclear] settled for him
and I am to do it, I mean I am
to get it [unclear]down[/unclear].
and you feel determined not to say
