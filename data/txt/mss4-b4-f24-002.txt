Richmond 28th of June 1826
My dearest sister
Your letter received this evening
was like a relief - we could not look for any
other termination & while the last hour seemed
to delay its coming we feared the beloved patient
might be a sufferer -- It is a consolation to reflect
on the calmness & quietness of the close - such
should be the termination of a life like hers - all
peace & purity & love & kindness -- may her example
long remain in our memories to incite us to
imitate her virtues & look for a similar reward
"How blessed was she o'er whose decline
the smiles of home did soothing shine
And light her down the steep of years!"
The first letter we received seemed to strike the
blow on poor Lydia - all hope was withered & every
letter since seemed only to prolong sufference until
this evenings account brought a sort of comfort with
it - a balm to think that all was quietly over
& that the dearly beloved sufferer was beyond the reach

of pain - Ah my beloved sister we deeply feel for
my father's deprivation - his is the greatest - not to
be repaired -Lydia is not selfish enough to dwell
on her own sorrow when she thinks of his & many,
many of her tears fall for him - How ardently
we wish he may think of attending to our beloved
mother's suggestion that he would come see us & try
our sympathy - Lydia talks of seeing him very
soon after the quarterly meeting here which takes
place the 10th of next month - perhaps he may
return with us - Our very dear love to Elizabeth
too - Lydia will write to her when she can command
a calmer moment - My dear Sister, it was very
kind of you to write all to us in the midst of
your trouble - Uncle & Aunt Harvey & dear Hannah
have shewn much tender feeling towards poor Lydia
at this trying time - My father Hally returned today
- now too late to release us - The impossibility
of being at his dear mother's bedside seemed to add
a keen fury to Lydia's grief but I hope she is now
reconciled & satisfied that it may have been [/insertion]for[insertion] the best -

It is a gratification to us now that our little one bears
the name of her revered grandmother - how much
more so, if she lives & learns to resemble her in more
than name - Our dear love to you all as if named
- individually & collectively we feel for all & with all
our dear friends who now share one common grief.
Farewell dearest Deb Your affectionate
J.JF.
My dearest my kindest Deborah accept my warmest thanks
for thy constant remembrance of me - I cannot express my
feelings but my James has done it for me. I wish I could
[unclear]be[/unclear] any comfort on your & particularly my beloved stew
father - Oh: it was agony to be departed from yet [unclear][/unclear]
I long to see one of you - to hear of every word which
dropped from the lips of our sainted mother. My
fondest love to you all. I mean to write very
soon. I can do little else but think of my darling
mother - sit thinking of her or reading her sentiments
now dearly beloved. Farewell dearest E & D.
