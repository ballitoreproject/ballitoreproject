My dear Mother,
in thy comfortable carriage, which we are much
obliged for accommodating us with, we stopped at
Brother William sister's, she came to the door & invit[insertion]e[/insertion]d
us in, said it was not convenient to her to accept
of your invitation at present, that the children were
well, except some having sore feet by the frost.
We received a kind welcome at Samuel Haughtons,
& have paid a visit to Deborah Wilson, who looks
very poorly, neither she, nor Betty, were at meeting this
day, Samuel says she is fretting after her son
Thomas, who has left her after his visit, fearing
lest he should fall into hands of the French,
his Master's shop being liable to be taken these
times of war, I pity her, because maternal
feelings cannot be avoided, tho' the object may not
be worthy. Cousin Abby Haughton dined here
yesterday with her children, I intend to go see her
Carlow 18 of 3 mo: 1795
We got very agreeably to this place
soon
Margaret Grubb.
Carlow: 18/3 mo: 1795

soon, have just rose from dinner: Ben & Thomas
Haughton seem poorly with colds. I suppose it is
a pretty general complaint, hope sweet little
Elizabeth is bravely to day, please tell her, her
Aunt & cousin desire dear love to her, as it is
to you all at both houses. Sally regretted her
departure from sweet Ballitore, she might
have said, as her Aunt Mary [insertion]once[/insertion] did with a little
variation, "Thy charms I just began to taste"
Sweet Ballitore adieu.
Sally says, she cannot tell how much she is obliged
to her Grandmother for intimating her being
inclined to a turn in her shape. I believe she
will indeavour to help herself. Mary Haughton
desires her dear love to thee, & the families at
both houses.
I believe I shall long remember my agreeable
visit to you, my love is to Samuel
I remain thy affectionate daughter
Margt. Grubb
