30 Aungier street 1st Month 29th 1818.
My dear friend
Since I wrote to thee last, I received
two letters from thee: one dated 23rd of 11th Month 1817,
the other 19th of 1st Mo. 1818 both of which were very acceptable,
& I am much obliged to thee for them.
Whenever any of you hear from Betsey, I would be
very much pleased by any little communication relating
to her, as I do not know when I shall get a letter
from her myself. When thou writes to me next, please
to inform me particularly how Deborah is, & whether
she rides out often now. - In one of thy letters thou
favoured me with extracts from some of thy correspondents'
letters, which pleased me very much, it would
be a very great gratification to me if thou would
continue in thy future letters to furnish me with
any thing which [insertion]thou thought[/insertion] would interest me, extracted from
them especially from Melesina's, as I have read
a great many of her letters, & [insertion]always[/insertion] admire them very
much. I have not heard, to be sure, of [unclear]Richard Cipens[/unclear]
arrival. I have not yet seen him. I am longing
for Charlie to come home, that I may become acquainted
with him. I am not sorry for the short visit
I suppose you have heard of Joseph Fayle's illness, it is said to
be a bilious fever, he has been very poorly indeed but it is hoped
the [unclear]worse[/unclear] worst part is over. The accounts yesterday & today were that
he was the same way, with little or no change; if I have any
later account before I send this, I intend to inform thee or Lydia
To whom I intend writing by this opportunity. Doctor Johnson is
attending Joseph.
I went out in the car with Samuel Bewley's family to dine with
them last first day, [insertion]lodged here that first night[/insertion][deletion]lodged[/deletion] came home on second day morning.
Thy time passes here most agreeably; they are a very sweet family.
I am afraid this letter will be very uninteresting to thee; but
I believe, it is the best I can write. With love, therefore to all
Ballitore, I remain thy ever affectionate friend
Remember me particularly to Thomas Fisher.
My sister Sally & tell her I
am far from forgetting her.

which I lately found you in Ballitore, as I think it
has in some degree increased my acquaintance with you,
& strengthened my attachment to you. I was pleased
to hear that your adult school is not utterly destroyed
by papal influence. The cause of education [deletion]shall[/deletion] [insertion]will[/insertion] prosper!
her! Please to tell thy brother Abraham that I
received his letter by Joshua Abell, as also the letter
of introduction inclosed therein. & that on the following
day, I went to the college of Surgeons, & saw his
[underline]cousin[/underline] John Shek[deletion]el[/deletion][insertion]le[/insertion]ton, to whom I presented the
letter. He seems to be a very agreeable young man
& [deletion]if[/deletion] said he was thankful for the kindness which
he had received from Mr Shackleton, when in Dublin
He asked me some questions relative to my medical
studies, & kindly promised to be of any assistance to
me that he could, & told me where he lived.
Please to tell Sally White, that it was not the Phillips
that asked for Debby Fisher that died lately, but his
brother William, & please to tell her also that I received
the pair of stockings by Joshua Abell. I hope I
am not troubling thee with too many messages, but [insertion]the following[/insertion] [deletion]this[/deletion]
one thou canst easily deliver I know. Please to tell the
master that I received his short letter, & that I have
not yet had time to exchange the book for him; but
intend to do so, when I can get an opportunity.

Now I come to thy own business. I received thy letter
for Jacob Harvey, with which I was much pleased
and am obliged to thee for the privilege of being allowed
& am obliged to thee for the privilege of being allowed
to read it. I gave it to John Todhunter last
7th day, & he will send it by the next verified which [insertion]sails[/insertion] [deletion]goes[/deletion]
There are two at present in this port, which are, I believe
to sail shortly. I delivered thy messages to Joseph
Humphreys, the morning after I received them
Our good friend Joshua Abell is well. I believe he
intends setting up school next week. He told me that
he hunted almost all the bookseller's shops in Dublin
for the "Young Woman's Companion," without success. Last
second day evening. I went to John Cumming and
[deletion]enquired[/deletion] asked him whether he had it, & he said he
did not know such a book; I also told him that
thou had not received the books which he sent, & he
said that the carman got them on Wednesday, of (that
was yesterday week, the 21st) Tell Elizabeth that I
drank tea with Eliza Young the night before last,
& that she was very well, & told me that she wrote
to Elizabeth last week. Mary Shackleton tells me to
mention Harriet [insertion][unclear]Lefann[/unclear][/insertion] in the first letter I wrote, & indeed
I can do no more [insertion]than [underline]mention[/underline] her[/insertion] for I really have not time at
present to go & see her. The day I dined there she
was very well, & very pleasant. Her father's spirits
were very good.
