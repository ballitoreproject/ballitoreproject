[23 June]
Esteemed Friend
As Tommy Doyle at his return
from Ballybarney did not hand you, the
letter he wrote here in my school, containing
the true state of the school, and his observations
thereon, thee can have a Copy of it
from me, that young man did not
find wish to lay it before you, which
in my opinion was acting very [underline]unkind[/underline]
As for the school indeed I never had
so bad a school in my life as I have
had since I came to Ballibarney, and
I assure thee I never would come to
teach in their County, were it not
on
Mrs. Leadbeater
Ballitore

account of my poor distesss'd Parents, and
having buried my Father last March
I have brought my Mother, to take
care of her, she is greatly afflicted with the
Palsey, you would pity her if you would
see her striving to take her Victuals-
Though myself and any Wife as
loosing our time[deletion][/deletion], there is several Motives
that compels me to continue here, this
first I carried leave it untill I see and
have my Poor Mother decently buried as
I have done with my Father, I am also
in hopes that as I have no Friend to
expect any kindness or assistance from
but thee, that when you come
to Ballybarney. and see what improvement.
that I have made on the Place
for the Short Time I have been in it,
you will be kind enough. to let the
Lady know how much she might
expect from me by way of improvement.
and I also am confident, that if the Lady
was to see how much the Place is improved
since I came to it, that with your
kind interceding for me she would give
me some encouragement.
your Obd. & very [unclear]NS[/unclear]:
