[9 oct., 1790]
Perhaps, as I hope to see thee soon, I should not now acknowledge the receipt of
my friend's letter, as Brother intends to write; but he told me he meant to desire
thee not to come till 4th day for reasons which he will give I suppose, & I was afraid
thou might be straitened by thinking I should expect thee soon[deletion]n[/deletion]er, & be uneasy
at thy delay; so I thought I would myself assure thee that I am quite satisfied
about it, & wish I may be always satisfied with what [insertion]is[/insertion] best & most convenient
for thee; yet am fearful of promising much beforehand, which too good an opinion
of self may sometimes induce me to. I have been well in health & pretty comfortable
ever since thou wert here, & free from what I was so afraid of: yet
I lament an insensibility of heart which seems alarming, especially now,
when I wish much for the contrary, & this seems all I want to enliven present
prospects. I got a letter from dear Susy Bewley by yesterday's post also, who
confirmed thy melancholy account of her journey, as also another from her
sister Nancy; I would not have endeavoured I believe to restrain the relief
of tears, my mind was so opprest with it, but time admitted no such
indulgence, for I had [deletion]can[/deletion] little enough to read my letters, when I
must mount Nell to go to Carlow, & could not write a line (because
there must be previous consultation thou knows) to send by the girl whom
A: Bewley wrote for, & besides the girl's going was rather uncertain, & no
post goes your way till 1st day - therefore I left the matter to father & brother,
who concluded to send thee the [insertion][underline]a[/underline][/insertion] horse I suppose to-morrow, as the messenger
can be best spared that & the next day, & when thou comes, how thou goes
to Clonmel is to be settled, which I suppose will be to ride with brother,

& thou art heartily welcome to my mare (& I am sure so was dear Susy & Tommy),
but father thought best to send [underline]his[/underline] for thee, which I was pleased at too, for I
thought in myself it might be said, both here & there, that I had [underline]sent for[/underline]
[underline]thee[/underline]. A little before I got thy letter I heard that the Mail-coach was overturned
at the head of our avenue, & though I also heard no one was hurted,
it seemed unpleasant that it should be thy conveyance; however if thou
wert easy to venture, I should be both to say much against it, believing the
protection of Him who cares for the sparrow is over thee. At Carlow I met
dear Sally Watson, Anne Elly & Sally, & several other friends. Jenny Haughton
mending finely, she spoke to me in private about our affair, which appeared
quite agreeable to her; no one else, except S: Elly, mentioned it to me there -
they were tender of one. I heard with concern that Wm Empson, after
weathering through a fever of 30 days, had got a relapse, & was now in so
hopeless a state, as to life, that the Drs. had declined their visits - It is pinching
when I think of his kindness to me when I was last in Munster, & of poor
Joss Beale's feeling heart how it will be pained - Yet I hope it is in mercy
this stroke is administered. As I mean to write to dear M: Pim, & have
little or nothing farther worth thy perusal I may now bid thee Farewell
