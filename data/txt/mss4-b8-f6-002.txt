Ballitore 24th of 6th month 1821
My dear Elizabeth
I was very much obliged to
thee for thy nice letter. I would like to be
employed by thee. I am very much obliged
for the ranunculuses thou bid me mark
they are very pretty; I wish thou could
see them. The evergreen woodbine is in
full blow also the Siberian Larkspur just
in blow. A Taverner got the first moss
rose out of thy garden. My aunt Anne
has got out several times since the weather
grew warm and sits in the arbour there are
three little robins visit her there.

H White I believe will soon go to the
North. I will miss her. I expect to
go home soon. I put down the [unclear][/unclear] thou
bid me. The horseshoe geranium is recovering.
I put it out. Thy royal scarlet
looks very pretty. Richard has got four
stocks of bees. I hope he will have a
great deal of honey. H Treasy has another
son, she has called him John.
Samuel Wright is on a visit at thy
fathers. We expect uncle Samuel some
day this week. Thomas & Fanny Bewley
are gone to Enniscorthy meeting, Lucy
not retured from Mountmelick yet.
my two Aunts join me in very dear love 
to thee. I remain thy affec.ate M A Haughton
