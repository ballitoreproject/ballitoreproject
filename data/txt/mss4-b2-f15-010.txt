Letter from Deborah Darby
                     C Dale 4th month 8th 1790 
                                                                                                    Answered 5/10month 
                It gives me much concern to remember how long I have been in replying to thy kind letter - my Dear Friend and Father in the truth - not that I think thou has lost any thing by my silence - but I have thereby deprived myself for a long time of thy valuable communications - and also of the pleasure of hearing of all your welfare - about which I continue to be affectionately interested - and perhaps I have as often indulged myself in paying mental visits to thee and thine - as if it had been more fully & frequently expressd - but as I know thou seeks thy [illegible] in the Truth - if I have been mercifully preservd I hope thou will have had at times - something like an evidence - that our fellowship is continued - well then my Dear Friend - accept now a tribute of sincere regard - and believe that tho I am poor - & often exceedingly dismayd - I still desire to be the Companion of those - who are in their different measures bound to the [illegible] and Testimony of our god  tho my allotment is most frequently to sit as with my mouth in the dust - hrdly able to cry for preservation - seeming in my own view rather to loose then gain ground - thus in the freedom I am giving thee a little account of myself - knowing that thy principle concern for thy Frieds [sic] - is - that they may be preservd out of the han[d] of an unwearied adversary - who has unhappily prevaild at times - upon those - who have made considerable advances in the Heavenly Journey - handing in instructive lesson to those that may think th[e]y stand to take heed least they fall 
                And [illegible] as a subject - that is of all other temporal ones  neares[t] my heart I have the satisfaction to inform thee - my Beloved Husband - is returnd to us perfectly restored - by which I have again the comfort of his Company and affectionate attention and he cannot sufficiently express his regard for his Friends in Ireland - & particularly towards thyself & fam[ily] [illegible] whom he desires to be kindly remembred

I should be glad to be Affectionately Remembred to all thy Family in which I am joind by all ours & am truly thy Sincere Friend
                Deborah Darby
my Dear M Young was much obliged by thy kind letter - & wishd to have her Love conveyd when I wrote 


I have not yet had the pleasure of seeing Dear Samuel Smith my Dear Friend RY & myself - having left home about a week before he reached the Dale - which was no small disappointment to us - we was then going to pay a visit to the families of Friends in Norwich & some other places - which visit we was favourd to accomplish to our own peace & got home the 16th of 2nd month last
I was affected to hear of the Death of our Dear Friend A. Sparks - tho I trust on her account there was no cause for sorrow - but she was a sincere steady Friend & many will feel her loss - but none like her Valuable Sister Ridgway to whom the account will be deeply trying - have you heard from Philadelphia lately? every account of those Dear Women now absent from you - for the Cause of Truth - is nearly interesting to me. I have only had one letter - & that was dated in the 11th month [illegible] -
            We did not see Dear E Bevington & A Hunt[?] on their return - which I regretted on many accounts as I was deprivd of an opportunity of enquiring after my Dear Friends in your Land - but our Friends at Salop spent a short time with them - and I was sorry by them to hear of the illness of thy GrandDaughter and as we are all anxious to know how the Dear Child now is - should esteem [illegible] a favour to have a few lines on the receipt of [illegible] - with such information respecting her - as you may then have it in your power to give us - 
                Thy Dear Wife I often remember as an Elder worthy of double honour - tell her - I am mindful of her advice and take good care of this poor tabeacle[?] - tho [illegible] think it unworthy of it 
We are all at present favourd with usual health - My Brother Rathbone expected who has b[ee]n much indisposed for many months his recovery seems [do]ubtful - he is at Liverpool. Our Valuable Friend AS[?] continue finely - has got through the present Winter with great [e]ase  her Dear Love attends all her Friends  Our Yearly Meeting to be held at LLanydloss[?] the 26th of this month - there [illegible] some reason to expect Dear G Dilwyne[?] Company there [illegible] he is so uncertain I am afraid to look towards it with much dependance  the last account of SS - he was at Gonlming[?] Quarter Meeting which was the 5th of this month he [illegible] then going into [illegible] bupene [?] [illegible] John Merryweather his Companion 
                I suppose our two Dear Friends HR & MH[?] [illegible] about leaving you after paying a long visit - it will be cause of thankfulness to many of us to so[?] then back in peace

When thou writes Dr James Abel please to convey my Dear Love & say I should be much pleased to see him at the Dale this Spring - as we all shall be to see thee - & any of thy family - please also to tell my Dear E Pim - that I receivd her acceptable letter - & if she doth not come over a Representative to London - shall I hope to write her by [illegible] that come over - but if she doth not come - I hope to hear from her -
