My dear Uncle

	I was this morning thinking that our beloved friends of Ballitore were letting us taste how good it is to have a plentiful meal of silence, but have since by the hand of our mutual friend M.D. had a taste of a more acceptable dish, the perusal of a welcome letter from thee to her, wherein thou enquires into the mystery of our opening house the 20th; though my time is so scanty yet as an opportunity has offerred [sic] I am disposed to tell thee, more for the love of conversing with thee than for its importance, that it was fixed upon without any contrivance or even adverting to the day of the week or the province meeting which shews our capacity for forethought; but now it is done like people willing to approve their own doings, we perceive a convenience ^in^ it to our friends of Limerick or Cork if any should incline to bring a girl or two from thence & conclude there will not be so many as to render it necessary for me to stay from the performance of any reasonable service  indeed my dear Uncle & friend I am very low in my expectations of any good coming of either ^this^ or other endeavours my hand has been put to  I sometimes am humbled under the sense of divine sufficiency to render successful & profitable our feeblest efforts & yet my own heart tells me I have no right to look for it  this conclusion however I come to that if either ourselves, our friends or both think it will be best to desist after a little trial I shall not be ashamed to comply  This I am conscious is not a time for the publication of discouragements nor ^am^ disposed much to divulge my feelings of them  in thy mind they are safe & thou knowst [sic] also the wisdom of divine dispensations & hast been acquainted from heartfelt experience with some of their humbling effects in preparing the mind for even domestic usefulness.
I am aware of the difficulty my dear aunt Shackleton especially, must feel under any proposal of given ^up^ one of her valueable [sic] daughters but I must add to what my husband has already said on the subject that ^one of^ their company & assistance is very desirable to us 
My heart often salutes our beloved Sally & not ^less^ frequently in sisterly affection desires her prosperity in that good work which I do beleive [sic] in acceptable sincerity ^she has^ put her hand to  she may like others have many buffettings and sit solitary under the pressure of them, yet on looking towards her my mind is comforted under the beleif [sic] that that true christian simplicity which she abundantly possesses will preserve from such sore wilderness 

travels as some murmuring israelites have had, & that her solitary places will more often be made glad, her desert rejoice & blossom as the rose year that ^secret^ joy & gladness will not only be found therein but public thanksgiving & the voice of melody 
	I must conclude or else my ^heart is^ just beginning to enlarge  we all unite in love & I am thy poor but affectionate friend SR Grubb
