"ups & downs, loss & gain, pain & pleasure, sours & sweets, are
mixed in this world"
My dear friend
I have just read in Cobbets Register the above lines
& have taken them for my motto to this little Epistle, believing you
had your share of these in the villages as well as others in other
quarters of this perturbed scene - we do & have felt for your
past & present trials - many woes are past & I fear one is yet
to come wch. may be the severest - I do not like to anticipate
its shade wth gloomy colours - yet I believe it an act of true
friendship to prepare the minds of our friends for what may
happen - our dear precious Lydia I fear will be hard set to
weather thro' the winter & spring - if it shd be otherwise alloted
we will have cause to rejoice - yet all our joys here shoud be mixed
with trembling - A little after this time twelve months I was
hovering over the dying bed of my beloved son, and then felt considerable
consolation from thy friendly communications, and
were it now in my power, I woud gladly contribute (repay I cannot)
my utmost to lighten the debt - but alas what can we do lighten
such an heart-rending affliction as this - except the Lord help
us in the [unclear]help[/unclear] - of [unclear]man[/unclear] - in some cases there is such a consolation
in grief that even the well meant intrusion of a friend
interrupts the joy - And indeed in the present case the joy of
grief will I believe not balance the sorrow, because this Angelic woman
carries in her countenance the evident marks of a fit member
for the society of the happy spirits released from all pain & sorrow

and when the joyful hope (whatever uncertainty may hang upon it)
of meeting there dear departed friends with whom we once
held sweet conversation will (I believe) always afford comfort to the
mind of true sensibility - the hope can do no harm whether
ever realized or not - but this we may be certain of without
any manner of doubting - that the Judge of all the earth will
do what is right - and whatever [underline]is[/underline] or befals us his appointment
is & must be right - this was the sublime sentiment of my favourite
poet, & while any [insertion]other[/insertion] sect produces such a man we ought to be
cautious of arrogating to ourselves any peculiar favours, yet he had
his faults in common wth others - and one wch. I scarcely can forgive
him - when he says "every woman is at heart a rake" yet his tenderness
& affection for his dear mother may in part atone for
this calumny - I expect thou my Dear friend wilt frequently advise
us of the progress of the disorder & whether any hope may
be reasonably entertained - We feel for the late trial of the
poor Chandlers are they to go back again to the house I hear
thou hast taken them under thy protection - from the present
appearance of the times & the [insertion]political[/insertion] madness of our rulers I look
forward towards some awful crisis - I believe the [unclear]destructe[/unclear]
of Jerusalem was discovered by Christ before the passing away of
that generation pointing out some outward signs [insertion]that wd. occur[/insertion] as certain
presages of the event, & I believe the abomination of desolation
was one & surely the increasing propensity to war & slaughter may
properly be denominated of this sort - above one half of the present
reign has been stained with blood Affy farewell S H
