To Elizth. Barrington
Madam
Mrs Fayle ordered me to call to see you when I would
reach home, & [deletion]may[/deletion] acquaint you with the sentiments of
my mind respecting the continuance of my wife with her. I
have delayed one day to make up my mind & came to this
resolution that I will see to reconcile my mind & leave her
until the year be fulfilled on condition that for she will shew no
displeasure to my wife on account of me going to the house to see
my wife which I consider is excusable as I had not other opportunity,
& also that I shall be let know by letter or otherwise if
ever she happens to be sick during the time & that she will
be allowed to go to Mass as often as possible without injury to
the children under her care. I came to this resolution more on
account of the attachment of the nurse to the child & the childs
attachment to her, & the Mrs kindness to my wife than the
hope of any future reward, For I assure you if she was at home
& all to be done again, I would not let her be sent [deletion]to[/deletion] [insertion]from[/insertion] me for
one year for half what Mr. Fayle is worth.
Mrs. Fayle expects you will acquaint her with the sentiments
of my mind which runs as the above
your obt. Servt.
 Wm Gyves
