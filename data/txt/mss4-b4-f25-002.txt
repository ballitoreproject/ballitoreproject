Richmond 28th of 12th month 1826
My dearest Deborah
Your sorrowful & alarming letter
filled me with grief, anxiety & mournful recollections.
Alas! one trouble is scarcely surmounted ere
another arises & poor Elizabeth to be the victim - she
who has been borne down with sorrow & now to have
sickness added. Your letter though not calculated to
alarm me, yet to those at a distance from the scene
any account of illness is distressing & appears terrific.
I am much obliged by your constant writing it is
like thee. My darling Deborah who did not forget my
feelings before - that one sad time when we were all
pierced with such deep & lasting anguish - I know in
reading my beloved Mother's letters I think I feel more
at least as much as at the time - but then I could not
at all analyze my feelings - nor can I bear to think
closely of the time yet. Ah! how much will Elizth
miss her delightful society & tender attentions during her
recovery - my poor Elizth! Always mention my father
particularly, & how he bears this fresh trial. Dear Betsy
"the friend in need" indeed, I can hardly describe how
I feel towards her how much has she done for us all!
& how ready she is to do more, & it must recal many
very painful recollections of pleasant times past - never
never to return. & how often will the thought recur that
never to return. & how often will the thought occur that
every minute of hope would be so delightfully passed in
the sunshine of our dearest Mothers countenance & conversation -
that beautiful beaming face how sweetly it
rises on my mind. It must be very cheering to
my poor father [insertion]to have Betsy[/insertion]. The last letters told me pleasant
news - the birth of Mary White's boy

I was very glad to hear it & of dear Hannah's improvement.
My dear love to both & congratulations to
James & Mary. I am sure we ought to be ever
grateful to Doctor Davis for not dying. Why not
have Winny Doyle as nurse-tender. I wonder she
have Winny Doyle as nurse-lender. I wonder she
was not preferred to a stranger. The spasms must
be very hard to bear. my Father [insertion][unclear]Fr:[/unclear][/insertion] & uncle & aunt
Harvey desire their love & sympathy to my father
& indeed they always felt deeply for his trouble.
I can never forget uncle Harvey's feeling & tender
visits to me in the time of my sore affliction - &
indeed, "[unclear]Fyns[/unclear] on it -" I love him better than I once
thought I ever could. I wish to hear how Edwd is.
Reuben Harvey brought me word from Dublin that he
(Edwd) was quite recovered from the fever, but that
he suffered from some hurt which he had got some
time since from a fall. - tell me how he is affected
Poor Elizth is the fourth in our immediate family
who have had a fever within this year - oh! that she
may get over it as well as the others have done.
My dear love to Richd tell him I do not forget him
on the contrary I often think of him & wish for him.
Indeed now in my lonely hours I am always thinking
of you in the sweet place of my birth. Thomas [unclear]Frethunter[/unclear]
spent his Christmas with us. - it was quite refreshing
to me to see a genuine Ballitore-boy & we talked over
old times with true zest. he is a very agreeable -
what - man - too old - young man - too stiff - fill
it up thyself. You had talking-William. We are well
here ... I am growing very impatient for this evenings
letter - & here is the postman's knock. Thanks for your attention.
the account is less cheering - but I always hope the best - my
dearest love to my father & Betsy. dear dear Betsy. I shall
be miserably anxious for tomorrows account.
dear love to Eben. Dearest Deborah farewell saith thy
LJ Fisher

My dearest sister, Lyd has expressed [deletion]bo[/deletion]the [deletion]our[/deletion] sorrow
& sympathy of both - we remain anxious, & thankful
for your constant letters - It may seem to Eben
that I have been remiss in not writing to him
about myself when I knew he was so interested -
This bad news from you kept me from obtruding
myself on you at such a time - I may just say
the election for Secretary to a public board here, took
place but Monday week - I was a Candidate & missed
Â£100 Guineas a year by one vote - If I had succeeded
I should have written immediately - I went to
Cork on the Wednesday following next
day received my freedom took for Hutchinson
[unclear]Chinson[/unclear] - went to Passage next day returned
turned here but Saturday - So I had not much
time for writing the account of my defeat - I am
looking out for a house to commence my Linen
business in & expect to be able to [underline]make out the cause[/underline]
I cannot now write more of myself - You are
all thinking of poor Elizabeth & so are we - We
look on your accounts as favourable & venture to
hope for the best - You do not mention our good
father in your last - I hope his spirits keep up -
I have not seen uncle James since his marriage
he was but once in Limerick - Yours most affectionately
J.J.F
