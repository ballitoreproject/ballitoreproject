However appearances may seem, yet has my mind
been very much with thee, my beloved sister; I have been
honing after thee, & wishing to know about thee & thine;
& though dear Mary Dudley often heard from home, yet
for several letters we could not hear as we wished about
your house. I thought I had requested brother Samuel
to inform me how sweet little Margaret's medicine continued
to agree with her, how Eliza's: cough was, & particularly
how thou held up through all: as far as I am
capable thou hast indeed had a large share of my sympathy
& love, & I thought I would scribble thee a few
lines, tho' can hardly say I have any thing worth
telling thee, save that our dear friend is (going on I
believe I might almost say) wading through the work
appointed for her to do, as well as she can, is far from
being stout, does not rest well at nights, yet is her
back fitted for it's burden: I pity her, & am ready
to wish at times she had a companion who could
share her burdens, & [underline]properly[/underline] sympathize & comfort
her, but I cannot (that I know of) help my poverty:
I love her, & strive not to do her any mischief: my father
& she are really a nice match, each seems to know
the

the other's thoughts, & if M:D is about to speak (at times)
to my father, he knows what it is she is [underline]going[/underline] to say:
so as she is so nicely fixed as to one companion, she
must put up as well as she can with the other, one comfort
is, it was her own doings. I expect some friends
will be coming from Clonmel to Mt. melick next week,
by whom I do hope to hear very many particulars
about you, particularly Margaret; I suppose her
doctoress has visited [insertion]her[/insertion] frequently. After visiting the
families (save 1 or 2) belonging to Mt. melick meeting,
father & M:D have got here, to Roscrea, & are about to
engage in like service here. - Alas! poor Betty Hutchinson,
she is seldom out of my mind since I came here,
I almost long, & yet dread, to see her. My father &
Mary Dudley send you dear love, mine to my many
friends there. I hope either father or M:D, will
fill this up, or I should grudge to send it.
Farewell affectionately, my dear sister.

My dear Margaret,
been scribbling I had a mind to add a line - This is on many accounts a very difficult,
arduous, unpleasant sort of warfare we are engaged in - I heartily wish us
& well out of this place - where I am afraid Satan's seat is. The dear love which I
bear our mutual friend constrains me to accompany her - even to die with her - &
indeed we seem to be in deaths oft – I am in health of body, through great favour – have
not heard from home since I left it 15th – Give my dear love to our dear E Pim. MD
wrote to her I believe lately - so I think not yet to produce my brown linen - We have
not yet sat with any family [unclear][/unclear] - I understand Gretta Pim has[unclear]in[/unclear] poorly
again - I cannot write to thee [unclear]much[/unclear] to my satisfaction - The proverb says, "[unclear][/unclear]
not to be had, the King must love his own," so here thy dear [unclear][/unclear]
left thee, my dear friend, and, as he [unclear]seming[/unclear] got lazy, or [unclear]d[/unclear]
somehow, and don't like[unclear][/unclear] on, I first thought I would fill the
Paper, tho' I seem to have nothing to say. We are down both of
us; something drew me here, and, if I dar'd wish, I could wish
to be drawn [underline]from[/underline] hence, but it seems as tho' we must stay
here, tho' I believe it will be to suffer, and, my beloved friend,
suffer we must, if we feel aright the Seed is in suffering,
it is appreh'd - "Where I am there shall my Servants be" is still
the language - I know not how I should get on, but for this
precious Father of thine, he holds up my Hands by his Love,
by his sympathy, and seems so willing to bear with all my
infirmities, that I'm encourag'd to go on, as light [unclear]clears[/unclear], [deletion]illegible[/deletion]
the way, tho' it be exceedingly rugged, and perplexed with various
obstructions - We attended Mt rath meet.g as it fell in course yesterday
a hard, laborious time to me, tho' I ventur'd, amongst Death and
Darkness, to go forth with my [unclear]hard[/unclear] thing, I don't know the stone hit
but I was very easy, and thy Father encourag'd by testifying his faith
so we go on thro' [underline]Depths[/underline] but not much [underline]Heights[/underline] with preservation
and dedication may accompany thro' all - - farewel [underline]my[/underline] dear friend
Roscrea: 30/3 mo: 1787.
Though I wrote thee (I think) from Mountmelick, as Sally has
I am thro' all changes thy affe.te
