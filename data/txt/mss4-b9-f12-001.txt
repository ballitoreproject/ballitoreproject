Edinburgh 6 Mo. 30 - 1820.-
Oh! Sarah, I am very much obliged to thee
for thy entertaining letter.- I felt more [underline]in Ireland[/underline]
while reading it, than at any time since I quitted
her shores. - Oh that I could convey to thee such
a transcript of Edinburgh & of the scenes which
occur to me, & the varied characters which are presented
to my view — but that is impossible — & were
it possible, such a representation would, I am
sure, gratify thee much less than thy interesting detail
of every thing in your sweet [unclear]retired[/unclear] village
as well as among the busy scenes of Dublin, [deletion]delighted[/deletion]
in which I felt an interest, delighted me —
I must not consider then this reply as by any
means [insertion]conveying[/insertion] an adequate return [deletion]for it[/deletion] of pleasure for
that bestowed on me by thy letter, unless [deletion]it[/deletion] indeed
I should consider it as the instrument of affording
that happiness, which every liberal mind enjoys,
on learning that it has increased the happiness of
another — On this errand then I send this
sheet, knowing that the gratification it will bestow,
shall depend for less on the contents themselves
than on the disposition of the mind for whom
they are intended - —
On seventh day I went on the excursion with Professor Jameson, but Joshua Harvey was not
able to come. I brought him a few plants but none of great interest — In the evening I
had a letter from my brother James, who speaks in a most enthusiastic manner of our
high-minded Queen, whose noble conduct, since her arrival has gained her many
friends, & put to silence the threats of her enemies.
On first day James Henry called on me to accompany him to church to hear the
celebrated Alison preach; (another of the [unclear]Eprings in Tarte[/unclear]) - After the tedious church-service
was got through, he gave us a sermon from [deletion]one of Peter's[/deletion] the following text in one of
Peter's epistles: "Love one another as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous" — a sermon which
I admire exceedingly as replete with the tender, merciful & benign spirit of Christianity
but my friend, on the contrary, did not at all like it, called it a flippant, well-written
discourse &c &c - Thus men's tastes & opinion differ; - but I think James Henry is given
to find fault with every thing in Scotland, & to prefer to it every thing in Dublin. —

What put it in thy head that I was in London? -
& by what authority didst thou inform Edward Barrington
that I was to attend the London meeting? — I
do not think that I made thee the depository of my
designs; but since I see that unless thou are correctly
informed, there is [deletion]do[/deletion] some danger of thy spreading
erroneous intelligence, - I now announce to
thee by my own hand & pen, that I do intend going
to London, about the latter end of the 9th month
next, & remaining in that city until the latter end
of the 5th Mo next ensuing. - How does Franklin's
Correspondence get on? — I am postponing from
week to week & month to month — the perusal
of Dr. Smith's Theory of Moral Sentiment, of which
I am inclined to form a very favourable opinion
from the high eulogies which I heard the late
much lamented Dr. Brown, Professor of Moral Philosophy
in this University, pronounce on it in one of
his lectures. -
Thy account of Stephen Grillet was interesting; I
was in hopes that he would have cause to enliven with
his presence the bleak region of North Britain, but
in this I have been disappointed -
Well Sarah! James Henry is at present in Edinburgh!
I expect him to tea this evening, I expect also
that he will be the [underline]unknowing[/underline] bearer of this to thee
as far as Dublin, as I intend to send it under cover
Yesterday morning a little before seven o'clock James Henry & I set out on an excursion
to [unclear]Roslin[/unclear] castle, which is very romantically situated on the [deletion]bank[/deletion] [insertion]side[/insertion] of a river called
the banks of which exhibit a variety of rich & beautiful scenery — but this scenery tho'
he acknowledged it to be "[underline]pretty[/underline]" had not enough of "the wild pomp of mountain majesty,"
to please James Henry — We returned home about half past two, & he came to tea
in the evening -. This morning I took him to hear Dr. Graham, the professor of botany;
& he says he hears very bad oratory here.- I do not think I have heard him praise
a single Scotch character since he came, & when he is applied to bestow some approbation
on any thing Scotch, he generally adds some [deletion]to[/deletion] qualifying phrase, which takes
much of the value away from it-
Perhaps I have now written enough, so Farewell —

to Edward Alexander - I must thank thee for
the pleasure of his company, for he [deletion]his[/deletion] is so sun-burnt
from his time, I certainly think I should not have
known him had not thou given me reason to expect
him - We met in Professor Leslie's lecture-room yesterday,
when I, after [deletion]thinking[/deletion] [insertion]wondering[/insertion] for a while who was
staring so earnestly at me at length recognised him.-
I desired him to call on me at half past seven
this morning to come & hear Dr. Graham Professor of
Botany, but, as he told me, since, the servant when
he lodged, [insertion]told him that "she[/insertion] awakened him, but he did not hear her."
He however called on me after breakfast, & I took
him to hear Dr. Alison on Medical Jurisprudence,
& Professor Jameson on Geology. I
have not seen him since, but after
tea, I intend to take him up to
Salisbury Craigs to view the setting sun. -
Has thou read in the Edinburgh Review, the admirable
review, of young Curran's admirable Memoirs
of his admirable father? I have not seen
the work itself but, I suppose, have received
a pretty correct notion of it through the reflecting
telescope of the Edinburgh Review.-
I suppose, before thou hast received this, thy
mother will have received a letter from me dated the
8th of next month, accompanied by a newspaper
for thee. - I anticipate much pleasure to-morrow
from an excursion along the shore of the Firth of
Forth, on which Professor Jameson is going to take his pupils,
of whom Joshua Harvey & I are two of the number. -

It is intended as a Geological excursion; but
I think, as far as concerns myself, that I shall make
a Botanical one of it, as I am somewhat more
interested in plants than in rocks; however I am
becoming much more interested in the latter than
I thought I should ever have been. - We have
delightful weather here at present, after a tedious
course of rain. - [deletion][insertion]But since[/deletion] But canst thou believe it?[/insertion] James Henry has seen
Sir Walter Scott, & Jeffrey the Editor of the Review,
& I have not yet seen either of them! -
7 Mo. 4.- James Henry came to tea on sixth day evening,
after which we mounted Salisbury Craigs, from whence there is,
I suppose, one of the first city views in the world. - James
Henry tells me that he has seen Juliet Smith, also Thomas
Wilkinson & his sister. - He has ascended Helvellyn,
(do I spell it right?) - He was not able to keep up
with T. W. walking! - He has seen Hogg, another of
the Queen's Wake. -
