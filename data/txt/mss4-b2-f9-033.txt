My dear Cousin,                                                Ballitore: 17/12 month 1778.
			I believe my last was of 13th - Believing thou art anxious to hear how John goes on I write a line to let thee know that he has still a cough, now & then a pain in his side, & some sweats, but not violent. On the other hand he looks better, is pretty cheerful, has tolerable appetite, & we hope rather gains than loses.
	In Carlow yesterday I heard the disagreeable news that John the Son of John & Abby Wright has been lately married by a priest (with license) at Tullow to his first-cousin a daughter of Peggy Stephens. This will be a sore trial I believe to his parents - The intercourse which they have kept up with Peggy Stephens other daughter married in like manner to Harvey, & living in the neighbourhood of Tullow has doubtless contributed to this match. Jane Watson of Rathrush has been very poorly, but better again. I understand Dr Fothergill has been very ill of a strangury, not expected to recover. Friends about Carlow much as usual. We are tolerably well here in general. My Sally is confined to the chamber by a swelling about her Jaw. John is just come in where I am writing, says he is better, & bids me send his love & duty - We all salute thee & thine, thy father & brother James with our dear love. I am, my dear Debby,
										very affectionately thine
