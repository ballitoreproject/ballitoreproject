Ballitore: 6/8 mo: 1808
My dear Betsy
I am just snatching a little time, till W:m comes down from the Inn ( the clock has
just struck ten) to scribble to thee being in a little mood for the purpose, but in contrast
dread of interruption. Last 4th day a Gentlemen came her he asked me did I recollect him
& said he was Philip Stacpole. How he had left school 30 years ago, & I had not seen him
since till then, so how should I know him - yet his eyes, smile, & turn of his countenance
might still be know but a portly man at the wrong side of 40 is very different from a
slender, pretty lad, something like Hoisted. His heart seemed glowing & overflowing with love
to the old place to his old friends & many a little anecdote he told of old times, amongst others
that on a Xmas day he went to Doven Bradys & partook of their mirth & good cheer, in the height of
which they recollected one of the family who had died since that day twelve months & remarking
that all were here but him & he away, they hope into such lamentation as quite changed
the scene & drew tears from the gentle spectator. I have manufactured the story & perhaps misnamed
[underline]named[/underline]it the [underline]Grief of Joy[/underline]. P.S dined with us. The two Lukys their brother & Sandham Elly,
it the [underline]Grief of Joy[/underline]. P.S dined with us. The two Beckys their mother & Sandham Elly
who came for Robt & [insertion]all[/insertion] returned after dinner with him, dined with us also, & John Christy, who
with WL on horseback, Philip & I in a chaise, set out after dinner for Ballybarney to adjudge
the premiums; the first of which, to my glad surprize I was ordered to give to the poor man
whose son was killed at Narraghmore by the fall down the stone steps. I had persuaded the
poor heart broken creatures to put in a claim, I thought it might divert their attention
little. The Queen of the May who expected [underline]that[/underline], [insertion]position[/insertion] was obliged to put up with the 2:d & dear
Dunn, whom I also encouraged to claim got the 33 notwithstanding the Scottish Judge
reprobated the thistles on his bank. He has had no account yet from his mother &
appears to be very dull Phebus beams not upon us. Philip I: wished much to see
thy father & enquired much about him, he remembered the horse he rode going to court, the
coat he wore & his manner of pinning up the skirts. He went this morning for Cork I
expect, in the Coach.
My dear Sister
Ends mostly seems to fall to my portion but
have not much to say as I cannot bare myself to hear things
over & over, I need not tell thee that my Aunt Chamber is
come & her only daughter Mary they will stay sometime here
As Elizabeth is [insertion]in a dreadful[/insertion] hurry to get me out of the house & my high
spirit will not allow to stay any longer I shall now conclude
Mary Matthews desires her love to you all
The Children the pin from thy poor old aunt ML who sends dear love to you all & to my dear
friends at Stramore, May Allen, Woodmount &c &c John Christy wishes you to go to see his uncle.
& remain thy ever affectionate
Sister
Margaret S

I have had a beauty of a letter from Thos. Wilkinson & some [unclear]vener.[/unclear] Thy aunt Chambers
& Mary are come with Richard. I have not yet seen thy aunt - Mary is all in black - they
arrived this day. Thomas Barrington has come. I suppose thou hast heard how suddenly poor
E: Thacker was taken away in Mt: melick - awful indeed! Brother I:C: had a severe attack
lately, perhaps before you went. Sister was much pleased with her visit here. We liked that
much. Mary Doyle has come in she gives her love - lucky Mark Allmont dined with them
very lately & John Haughton Pheban was here last first day, what will ensure in consequence
of thou visits Time must tell.
7th: We had Hannah here two or three minutes
ago & the minute she saw black
John or Bonaparte or Button dandy or
Prince of Dunghills she[deletion][/deletion] [insertion]cried[/insertion] but I am
sure if he took her in his hard hands
she would roar, Phebus says he dont like
nursing, but Black button is too cute to
say that. How are you all or are you too
grand to deign to to write to me. I will
not say to remember me as you could
not help thinking of me some times I think
When will you come home or where are
you, I suppose thou heard thy Aunt
Chambers & Mary Catherines is come
somebody for poor Margaret. Does thou
intend to be very thick with Elizabeth
when thou comes home or that thee
may if it will hinder thee from making
game of Margaret & me.
Thomas Wilkison wrote a verse on on
to the Birds & sent it to me so thou
sees I [deletion]made[/deletion] [insertion]got[/insertion] something by making verses
for he saw the one I made on the Bird
farewell my dear Betsy I often think
of thee & Burns. I am thine Deborah

The Grief of Joy.
O The wine it blew loud & the wind it blew [insertion]cold[/insertion]
and pitiless Winter on Nature had frown'd
But in Owen's warm cottage, we need not be told
Good friends & good cheer & good humour were [insertion]found[/insertion]
For 'twas on the day when festivity reigns
When the hard-labouring Peasant a feast will [insertion]provide[/insertion],
When the poor man of hunger no longer complains,
And friendship & kindred rejoice side by side.
Hither wander'd young Philip, light-hearted, was [insertion]he[/insertion]
And his heart was benevolent as it was gay.
He mingled, unblamed, in their innocent glee,
For who were so happy, so festive as they.
On the dreper the pewter as silver shone bright
The table with viands unwonted were crown'd
While the beverage wch gladdens the Irishman's sight.
In glasses clear sparking, went joyously round.
Well how dost like it? Is it not very pretty? Yes
O I thought that would be thy answer. My pen was so
very bad I could not write so John Christy senr made
another which I now try worse & worse [underline][unclear]ochkone[/unclear][/underline]
its a poor case now I've mended one for my self
and its no better I really know not what to say
but here comes Deborah; she has done as do now
and I again begin, my father, Ebenezer & [unclear]36 send[/unclear] are
very busy hasting about harvest & home; my
mother has taken Phebus to the garden I have
at last got a peep at him as well I could considering
the glory that surrounded him, to help truth
he seems all on, fire for Elizth thou mayest kno
But why does that cloud overshadow the brow?
From whence springs the tear drop which swims [insertion]in the eye? [/insertion]
"O Jimmy, tho' cold in the grave thou first love,
"Thy memory, sweet blossom of hope, shall not die!
"How gay was our meeting, how pleasant our cheer
When last we assembled on this festal day,
"All, all who then circled the board, are now here -
"All, all but our Jimmy! & he is away!" the love
Other lamentation burst forth like a flood
From one to another uncheck'd while it ran,
Loud echoed the sobs & the tears swiftly flow'd
And the day closed in grief wch so cheerful began!
Then Pity's soft dews hung on Philips fair cheek,
While on his young bosom reflection bore sway,
He thought that while Pleasures gay phantoms we [insertion]seek[/insertion],
comes sorrow & chases these phantoms away!
out there

I went to day to see Sylvie Boake she is almost well
his mother's hands look [underline]white[/underline] & [underline]soft[/underline] what more
can she wish. Dost thou remember how
she used to complain to [underline]us[/underline] about them. They
are nicely speckled with purple, which perhaps
is an ornament I would not think it only
I hoped Deb would have written more but.
Tho wish these men would rise from table[insertion] it[/insertion] is
past 4 o'clock & I'm housekeeper [unclear]adi[/unclear]
Write to me ML: To go to see A: Atkinson
of thee & Barns & soon thine Deborah
