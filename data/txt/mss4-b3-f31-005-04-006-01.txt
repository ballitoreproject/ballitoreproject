Ballitore: 13th of 3rd month 1792.


+++ Ah, dear Anna, we have lost our beloved friend Samuel Neale  he was I believe so plied with opiates, and affected with his disorder, that I apprehend towards the close, not much transpired from him of a spiritual kind  but when his understanding was unclouded, his effusions were such as belong to victory and triumph. I understood that thou wanted to know [page number] 247 about his last end  so I sent thee all I know  the upshot of which is that I believe his latter end was peace  I suppose his bodily struggles with that last enemy were not more severe than is usual. He had a prodigiously large funeral  Sally writes ten thousand people. May the late removal of divers worthies, and the present state of the church be properly laid to heart by the surviving, feeling member of it  and may the Lord of all right ability strengthen his poor, weak, dependent children and servants to do the share of the work allotted to them, that so, whatever may be their distresses and conflicts here, they may at last shine as the firmament, & as the stars, for ever and ever! Farewell, my dearly beloved child, and believe me, with unaltered, undiminished attachment, 
        thy faithful, affectionate friend
                Richard Shackleton
