table., As Elizabeth, Jane,
Uncle F and Frank
dined with us. They
all went away soon
after dinner. Papa
went out to Glendruid
to tea but I did not
go after all. as I got
no encouragement to
do so. As Nannie
we thought would
be expecting one of us
out, I went out by
the Â¼ 7 omnibus. and
found her in at
Louisa Griffin's, where
she had gone in to
tea. I sent Jane in
for her and she seemed
very glad to see me
