O martyred maid who thus[insertion] died[/insertion]obscure
Oh martyr'd maid who thus obscurely [insertion] died [/insertion]
Has not thy precious blood for vengeance cried
No - by thy blessed hands example taught
Thou wouldst implore forgiveness for the fault
Methinks I see thee on thy seat divine
Where morning stars for ever [unclear]ring[/unclear] & shine
My raptured soul springs up & longs to mix
with thine

Where all was well arranged & fair displayd
There on a sofa sat a lovely maid
I saw the Maid I started at the view
for well that form that mien that air I knew
Her face unveiled no pale disease exprest
By rosy health each perfect feature drest
Yet grief sat heavy on her polish'd brow
and her fair bosom throbb'd with swelling wo
Thus spoke my guides our sister [insertion]here [/insertion]you behold
Apostate from our faith in error bold
We are of Abram's ancient faith but she
Has heard thy doctrine & is warp'd by thee
Tried & condemn'd for this her death is nigh
A dreadful death by stoning doom'd to die
Yet all forgiven if she her crime repent
Oh save her & this dreadful death prevent
Thy words persuade her Judges can forgive
Plead with her for her life bid her return & live
Then from the couch the weeping maiden sprang
And prostrate round her brothers knees she hung
Oh loved for ever lov'd tho' thus severe
This pious man & your sad sister here
O let there truth divine your [unclear]commands[/unclear]
Let me explain what from these truths [insertion]I felt[/insertion]
Oh let not zeal your [unclear][/unclear] rashly move
Hear Nature's voice oh hear the God of Love
No more - be relent - a short space we give
[deletion]For[/deletion] Thee to reflect [insertion]to[/insertion] [deletion]&[/deletion] him to bid thee live
Frowning they [insertion]spoke & left us[/insertion] past away while from her face
Faith hope & love beam'd forth with heavenly [insertion]grace[/insertion]
[insertion]And thus[/insertion] Could those I love with eyes awakened see
[deletion]That grace[/deletion] that holy gift of grace vouchsafed to me
Then joyful would I close in death mine eye
Even now I joy in Christs pure faith I die
She spoke then ceas'd her voice of [unclear][/unclear] 
And solemn silence settled all around
It seem'd as if her spirit upward [unclear]soar'd[/unclear]
And mine beheld her [unclear]transport[/unclear] & ador'd
The dark brow'd brothers [insertion]appeared again[/insertion] now returned
In vain we reason'd we implored in vain
They heard with grief with anger & disdain
and led away the victim of their zeal
Oh could fraternal bosoms cease to feel
Returnd they [unclear]taught[/unclear] me to the fatal
The lamp burn'd sepulchral was the gloom

I feel as if the sight I still beheld
Which all my [unclear][/unclear] with horror thrilld
The beauteous martyr laid upon a bed
a linen covering o'er her limbs was spread
Her eyes were closed resign'd she seem'd to wait
In holy calmness her approaching fate
And piles of stones around the chamber stood
Ah soon to redden in her guiltless blood
now turn'd on her the wrathful brothers eyes
I saw I felt their fierce passions rise -
And ne'er [deletion]to[/deletion] disclose the secret of her death
Till I reveal'd it with my dying breath
They bade me lest there vengeance I should [insertion]share[/insertion]
Their sister's destiny their feelings spare
They claim'd a solemn oath my faith to [insertion]bind[/insertion]
[deletion]A doom like hers if I should[/deletion] assignd
[unclear]the was[/unclear] her [insertion]dreadful[/insertion] [doom to me assignd
I knew I could not save her life [unclear]I own[/unclear]
They led me then [unclear]from[/unclear] the [unclear][/unclear]
[deletion]Replaced the bandage[/deletion] on my eyes
Then o'er my eyes the scarf again was spread
And to my home [deletion]again[/deletion] a mourner I was led
