My dear aunt
It was not thro' neglect or
decrease of affection that I did not write to
thee ere this, & as to not sending my love
to thee in particular I own I was remiss
for I always included thee as one of our
family since thou removed under our roof
I long to see thee & thy apartments more than
I can express but that pleasure is denied
for a season. I hope to meet thee in Carlow
at the meeting as I believe I shan't get
home sooner than that time. We are all
liable to disappointments in this state: but
my dear aunt thou must make allowances
for my mother not spending as much time
with thee as might be agreeable to both,
I fear she has a great deal to do, on acocunt
of my absence, & D's departure, & this reflection
often embitters my moments. I
hope she does not overdo herself & that Sarah
is useful - Are she & Lydia agreeable?
Dost thou often pay M & A D. a visit? Please
give them my dear love, thou art a trusty

person to give a commission to therefore I will
thank thee to give my dear love to my uncle &
aunt S. Mary Margt & George, J W. & Betsy, Hannah
& Anna, J & J. Thomas, T. & H Boake, F & L. Bowley
M. Haughton, EB's family, Ellen Thomas, A Wright
& our own dear little H White - I received letters from
Betsy, Mary Margt & George all of which were truly
welcome & shall be duly answered - Thine was
also very acceptable & whenever all things correspond
I hope thou wilt write again to poor
"Eleesabeth" I am [insertion]called[/insertion] "Miss Eleesabeth" here just as I
am at home. This is a letter of love for I
dearly love you all & wish you to know it
Wilt thou remember me to Mary Kelly & Tim,
Nurse Lennon, our servants, Jane Lennon, of whose
safety I am glad to hear & hope her son may
live to be a comfort to her - I hope Sarah
attends to her. I could particularize many more
but think I have given thee enough of [underline]bother[/underline]
for the present - How are Mary Casey & family?
& how is my dear Mary Dowling? I have heard
nothing of her for months. Is her child thriving?
Sally White told me Judy Mulroney has a son
called Joseph. I would like to be remembered to her
& Bess Lennon. I began to write on half a sheet
unknowingly & my pens are special bad ones
so altogether this is but a poor offering however
