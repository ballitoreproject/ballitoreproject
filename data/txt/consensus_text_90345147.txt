them on its way to town on fourth
day.
26th Ellen and I spend most of this
morning reading and working
with a little music intermixed.
After dinner we took a drive through
Sir George Hudsons, round by [unclear]Limestone[/unclear]
and home thro' Powerscourt's domain
so we "killed [underline]three[/underline] birds by the one stone"
this time. After tea at about 8Â½
I think, we had a very good view of
the comet now visible; from near the
haggard gate. We have not allowed
the poor piano much rest since
tea.
27 Papa went to town after breakfast -.
Ellen and I thought a ride would
be very pleasant, so had the horses saddled
& brought down to the door at about
12 - Ellen mounted the filly tho' against
our advice, for she is sometimes so
wild we were afraid she was not
safe for such an unpractised ride
