to ourselves - I went to Aunt Coles to tea.
met there Ellen Allen and Debbie Chandler,
As this was the last evening of the
Mutual improvement We went to it.
Three anonymous papers were read
On China, beards, and the rights of
man, the two last as Papa says -
'very childish subjects' - Jonathan Pim
closed the evening with a short speech
or rather lecture on civilization and idolatry
as well as I could make out. It was well
attended I suppose on account of its
being the last of the session
being the least of the session
21st.. Was out much of to day shopping
with Mama, She and Papa left this
soon after dinner for the country.
After tea Charlie read to me a little while
and then went to the office I think so
I have been alone since. Got into a
brown study and indulged in a little
cry - thinking of Polly - feel very shall
I say unhappy, no that is not the best word
tho I could not leave the first syllable out
