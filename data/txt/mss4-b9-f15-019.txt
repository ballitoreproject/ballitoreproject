Helen Gillies's 2 Hays-street Edinburgh 1 Mo. 24 1821 -
Thomas Fisher to Sarah Leadbeater -
I received a few days ago, thy acceptable letter begun on the last day of 1820,
as thou wilt have learned, I expect, long before thou received this, by a letter to thy
sister Lydia, which I sent under cover to Edward Alexander by Dr. Herberski,
a Professor of Medicine from Wilna, who leaves Edinburgh for Dublin [insertion]this morning[/insertion] - I mention
these particulars that if the letter should not be received, some enquiry
may be made respecting it. - I gave Herberski a letter of introduction to Dr.
Orpen.
Who informed thee that our good landlady was "low, & fat & bustling?" was it
Dr. Harvey? - I have little doubt that if your worthy friend Suliot
& I were to converse together on the subject of the Scotch character, we
should find that we did not differ much in opinion respecting it. - All
characters, whether individual, or national, will exhibit defects, when examined
narrowly & partially - & it is probably [deletion]by[/deletion] [insertion]from[/insertion] my having dwelt so
much on the [underline]defective part[/underline] of the Scotch character, & [deletion]saying[/deletion] [insertion]having read[/insertion] little or nothing
of their good qualities that my statement of it appears erroneous -
And the cause of my taking this partial view of their character, arises,
I think, from the previous [underline]high[/underline] opinion I entertained of it, when I was
accustomed to look [underline]only[/underline] at its good side; - in consequence of which, when I afterwards
had an opportunity of taking a closer view of it. - its good qualities
[insertion]the existence of[/insertion] which I had always acknowledged, were comparatively overlooked, - while its
defects, which were new to me, attracted more forcibly my attention -
I now acknowledge that the Scotch, [insertion]generally speaking[/insertion] are an enterprising, industrious, prudent,
intelligent, thoughtful, kind & hospitable people, & I also assert that [insertion]generally speaking[/insertion] they are
a [insertion][deletion][unclear][/unclear][/deletion] proud,[/insertion] cunning, selfish, insincere, avaritious, hypocritical, superstitious, & bigotted people.
Thy account of your two foreign visitors was interesting - I should like very much
to have seen & conversed with them. - I have not yet received the copy of
Lydia's poems from E A - but perhaps may do so before I send this, & can then
say what I think of them -
27 - Thou gives such a flattering account [deletion]of the improvement of thyself[/deletion]
& all thy friends since I saw you last, that it is almost enough to tempt
me to fun & take a peep at you & pay my respects to the young bard. -
Thou asks me did I ever hear of think that Chalmers was as deist -
I think in my last letter to thee, I introduced to thy acquaintance several of my friends here - I may now proceed
with them - I shall begin with a very agreeable family of friends, with whom I often spend a first-day evening along
with some [deletion]that[/deletion] of the students here - George & Anne Miller, the heads of the family, are rather advanced in life - George
is a very worthy man & on the whole very agreeable, - but he is apt to take up strong prejudices against some people without
reason & allows his mind to be too much narrowed towards those who differ from him in opinion - his wife is a complete
contrast to him in this respect, & is one of the most liberal & simple-minded women I ever met with - tho' her husband
seems to think her too latitudinarian in her principles, & sometimes tells her she don't know what she is talking about -
Of the oldest son, George, I need say nothing, - as I can say nothing good of him - of two other brothers Joseph & William
the latter is at present in London succeeding very well as an engraver, the other, Joseph, lives at home with his father. He
is a sober steady-going, young man, & often reminds me of Joseph Bewley, - tho' he is not near as clever, or so well-informed -
He is very fond of metaphysics, & of hearing sermons - I believe he goes to church almost every first day afternoon -
The two daughters, [insertion]Elizabeth & Anne,[/insertion] are, as far as I know them very agreeable & well-informed; - the manner in which the former makes
a remark often reminds me of thyself - I heard her the other evening warmly & ably maintaining the cause of the education
of the poor, with a medical student who entertained doubts of [deletion]her[/deletion] its propriety, - & as I fancied at the time, much in the
same [deletion]way[/deletion] [insertion]style[/insertion] as thou wouldst have done -
15th Well! you may give up all hopes of seeing Henry Gaulter [deletion]this se next soon[/deletion] [underline]this[/underline] year at least - he sets off to-day for
Liverpool, from whence he sails for Leyhorn, & will probably remain on the continent until next winter, & then return to Edinburgh. -
The occasion of this journey is the delicate state of his health, which he is in hopes, will be improved by a warmer climate. -
I spent above an hour with him yesterday - he expressed himself very much gratified with the printed Magazines which
I had lent him, - & spoke of accompanying me to Ireland, after our graduation in 1822. - His absence will be much regretted

I have often heard that he had [underline]once[/underline] been [deletion]once[/deletion] a [underline]deist[/underline] - but that word is used
in so very vague a sense - that I really do not know what [deletion]he[/deletion] [insertion]it[/insertion] means - I
have heard deism & atheism used as synonimous terms - & I have heard
Pope's Universal Prayer, although a paraphrase of [deletion]what[/deletion] the Lord's prayer,
called deistical - because it is addressed to one Father & not three. -
I should like to hear from Chalmers himself what he [underline]did[/underline] believe, & what he
[underline]does[/underline] believe - & what he understands by deism - before I should give a decided
opinion on the subject. -
As to a course of reading; since thou hast begun the Roman History, I recommend
thee to go on with it, tho' I think it a pity thou shouldst give up mathematics -
when thou hast read through the Roman History (whose is it?) Gibbon's decline
& fall & Euclid's elements, perhaps I may give thee some more directions.
2nd Mo. 6th - Thy birth-day, which I intend to devote in part to writing
to thee. - I wish first to tell thee of an unexpected & [insertion]very[/insertion] agreeable discovery which
I made a few days ago - the circumstances of which are as follow: - I was
last summer introduced by Dr. Harvey to a gentleman [insertion]named Sibson[/insertion] from England, but
who took his degree of A. M. [deletion]at[/deletion] in Dublin College, & who is at present
residing in Edinburgh, as a master of a small day-school - he also conducted
until a few weeks ago, one of the Edinburgh newspapers - I have,
at different times found a good deal of pleasure in his conversation on various
subjects, & the last night that he was here, we proposed that we
should take a daily walk of an hour together - In one of these walks
about a fortnight ago, he happened to mention that one of the boarders in
his house was "a Friend" from Cumberland - [deletion]& that his name was[/deletion] where
his father whose name was Saul, had a large school - it immmediately
occurred to me that thy brother Richard had been at that school &
I said that it was possible that Saul was acquainted with a friend of
mine who had been at that school - Sibson enquired his name - "Leadbeater," -
said I. - "Leadbeater - he is probably from the south of England"
said Sibson - I answered in the negative & asked whether he had ever heard
of Mary Leadbeater, author of "Cottage Dialogues" - "Yes!" he replied - "I have,
& I think I recollect having seen a son or son-in-law of hers in the north
of England" - I thought at once of Ebenezer & Deborah & asked him was his
name Shackleton - "It was - that's the very name, - I met him at an
agricultural [deletion]fair[/deletion] [insertion]meeting[/insertion] in the north of England - & dined in company with him & Mrs.
Shackleton, - whom I thought a very nice young woman." - Thou mayest
by many of [deletion]the students[/deletion] his fellow-students here - he is obliged to resign his situation as President of the Medical Society,
in consequence of which there will be a new election - I have heard already of several candidates - a friend of his own, named
Brabant is most likely to succeed -
I had a letter from my brother James about a week ago, by which I find that George & Betsy Shackleton were at
the Cork meeting - it seems George is becoming a very constant attender of quarterly meetings - My brother James is likely to
obtain a situation under Wm. Bell at Belfast - this will bring him so much nearer Scotland, I hope, as to induce him to
take a trip over here in the course of the summer - I had a letter also lately from Edward Barrington, who informs me
of the Opposition Education Society lately formed by the Roman Catholics - I do not anticipate much from this new association -
the Roman Catholic clergy, as a body, have shown too much practical opposition to the cause of education,
[deletion]as[/deletion] to induce me to rely on their new professions of extraordinary liberality. - Edward also informs me that Joshua Abell
has just concluded his "Tour to the lakes," of which he is to be favoured with the reading, he understands it is adorned with
several flights of poetry. -
3 Mo. 2nd On reading over what I have written of this letter, it occurred to me to request thee to communicate its contents
to as few persons as possible - as there are several parts of it which I would not wish to travel far beyond thyself -
To proceed with my sketches of character - there are two families at which I visit which I have not yet mentioned -
those of the two John Wighams. - John Wigham junr. son of John Wigham senr. a minister in Aberdeen is an agreeable,
honest open-hearted friend - his wife, who is in very delicate health is a nice woman - they have one daughter, a child. -
The other John Wigham is first-cousin to the former & is called John Wigham tertius, - or for shortness John Tertius, or
sometimes simply, Tertius - both he & his wife are from the north of England, they are an agreeable, kind,
& hospitable couple.

judged with what delight & surprise I made this discovery of a new link
in the chain of our friendship which renders it to me doubly stronger & more
interesting - we continued for [deletion]this[/deletion] [insertion]some[/insertion] time on this pleasing topic - & he requested
me to recall the circumstances to Eben's recollection. - He is also acquainted
with Thos- Wilkinson - & the Bonhams. -
My friendship with Henry Gaulter, is also increasing - &, I am daily
becoming more & more sensible of its value - I am in great hopes
of persuading him to visit you next summer - He is at present rather
poorly in health, & is remaining for a while near Leith - I have spent
two days with him since he went there. - My last visit was paid yesterday,
when I was accompanied by his brother Thomas, who is a very fine boy - I
took Henry the printed volume of the Ballitore Magazines (which I
received a few days ago from Edward Alexander) which I thought would
amuse him in his lonely retirement, particularly as it contains so many
contributions of his friend John Bonham's - With Lydia's [underline]printed[/underline] poem, [unclear]&[/unclear]
also with the Bards of the Vale, [insertion]of[/insertion] which I received [deletion]in[/deletion] [insertion]a[/insertion] manuscript copy - I am
much pleased, particularly with the latter - her lines, it is true, require a
little pruning, - but perhaps that is a good fault in a young poet -
when luxuriant thoughts naturally show an uneasiness at the controul of
the artificial restraints of rhyme & meter - "The bard of the vale" - surpasses,
in my opinion (I say it with all due respect & deference) [deletion]some[/deletion] [insertion]many[/insertion] of Deborah's
[deletion]first[/deletion] [insertion][underline]earliest[/underline][/insertion] productions - & I think her Muse affords "ample encouragement" - to
her to renew her addresses - "I must not forget noting, by the bye,
thy own little stanza which so admirably depicts the lively playfulness
of thy sister-bard -
There was a very interesting debate a few nights ago at the Medical
Society, on the system of Gall & Spurzheim," which was opened by Henry Gaulter
in a speech of above an hour, equally remarkable for force & connection
in the train of argument, - clearness of arrangement, - & eloquence of language -
The part he took was against the system - & it served to dispel from my
mind the last relic which it possessd of attachment to [deletion]the system[/deletion] [insertion]it[/insertion]. - He
was followed, but can hardly be said to have been replied to by a Doctor
Sanders - who did not [deletion]farly[/deletion] [insertion]fairly[/insertion] meet a single argument & who was so disconcerted
as to leave the field in a short time after - Gaulter wished to make
more observations in reply, but from his delicate state of health, & exhaustion from his
speech, & the crowded state of the room, was unable to rise - Sibson also
made a very warm speech against the system. -
10th I had a letter from my brother James last night conveying the melancholy tidings which will probably have
reached thee before this letter, of the decease of my aunt Mary H. Fisher - I could not say that the [deletion]account[/deletion] intelligence was
unexpected, - as the accounts of her state of health which I had been receiving for some time previous had gradually
prepared me for it - but so closely do we cling to the faintest hopes of those whom we love remaining longer with us,
that their death, after the most tedious illness, appears sudden - & we then feel their loss more sensibly than before from
being compelled to look upon that as certain, which we had previously wished as little as possible to anticipate. - My
Aunt Harvey must feel this second stroke most acutely, - for she had been always a most fond & affectionate mother -
By a letter which I had about a week ago from my cousin Mary Dawson, I was very sorry to be informed
of the death of Eliza Watson, of whose illness I had heard nothing - & what must add to the distress of
that affectionate family, - her sister Hannah Leeky was so ill as to occasion some alarm - [insertion]which[/insertion] I sincerely hope may be
groundless. -
I cannot persuade myself that this letter will not prove to thee uninteresting - but I owe no letter to any
other Ballitore correspondent (except thy sister Lydia, to whom I must endeavour soon to discharge my debts) - I send
this with the hope of eliciting a letter from thee, which will inform me that my apprehensions are groundless. Please
to keep this letter as secret as possible - & with a feeling of warm regard for thee & my other kind friends in Ballitore
I bid thee farewell -
