Bloomville 17th Novem. 1786
Dear Mary,
I am not insensible of my inability in writing
to thee, nor either am I of the favour thou conferred upon me in
permitting me, but as thou desired I should let thee know
what reception I met with, I will, however disagreeable it
may be. I got here 5th day before dinner, and instead of their
being glad to see me, & welcome me as usual, they seemed
as if suprized that I should come, and my sister who would
before fly to see me, never moved and scarce spoke to me
when I entered the Parlour; they used me at dinner like
a great stranger, kept the conversation to themselves,
except when I would ask a civil question or the like, and
answered me as cool and as angry like as if they considered
me as an intruder, spent the evening pretty much
the same way, took leave of them & went to bed, and here
am I writing to thee before I see them this morning, what
farther they will do I know not - a great change, strange
people, angry and they dont know well for what, I believe -
because I am not a fool, which they now consider me in
the highest sense. - I will please thee I dare say when
I tell thee I dont think any thing of it, or the worst treatment
they can use me with, 'twill be of short continuance & even
suppose

suppose it was to be for my lifetime what signifies it
when I just consider who and for what cause it is -
the first and greatest - Therefore dont thou be uneasy
I request thou may not, and I flatter myself that thou
in some measure would willingly grant it, for it
would add greatly to my uneasiness if I thought that
thou would be a sufferer also; why do I say suffering
it is not, it is nothing, only a man & a woman
angry O! it dont signify at all, I purpose being
in Mt. Melick 1st day - Thy letter will be highly
acceptable to me, my love is in general to all Friends
& am my dear Mary -
thy very affectionate
& much obliged friend
Wm.. Leadbeater.
