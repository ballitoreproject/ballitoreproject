Dublin 9th- of 10th mo. 1828
My dear E
I write to thee by Lodge
the Coach Man & sent a parcel for
Deborah, which I find by thy letters
has never reach'd you, I wrote to thee
letting thee that A J Henry was going
down with Nurse & child on 5th day
& asking thee for a bed for her & her sister
she is delicate & very unused to han[unclear][/unclear]
& I thought thou would be glad to
be of use to her, however if thou shd
go to the Inn to see her I think it
would be a comfort to her she goes
tomorrow ever thy SB
Debby got home safe
I will attend to the example
the weather has been so extremely
wet that I could not go look for
Adam but tomorrow I intend to do
so Lucy Doyle is not expected to
live she is worn out with illness
