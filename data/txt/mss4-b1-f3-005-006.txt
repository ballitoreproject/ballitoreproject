	“We are very desirous of seeing thee at home, for several reasons; and yet very loath to interrupt thee in that in which thou proposest to thyself an [margin: 8] advantage, or, at least, a satisfaction; for thou mayst assure thyself, while thou continuest to eye the best things, thou art and wilt be near to me.”

“My dear son, that gracious hand that dispenses favours liberally, hath not been wanting to my mind, since thou left us, and thou hast been nearly remembered by me; and my desires are, that thou mayst often

 P.8] participate of those riches and treasures that add no sorrow but give the soul dominion over all lower enjoyments. This sifting, winnowing, purging, cleansing hand, that would make room for itself—that would leave nothing but the pure, weighty grain—bring [sic] every thought, word, and action to judgment; may it be attended upon, and, when retired and withdrawn, patiently waited for. Experience tells us here, too, that the prodigal must know want.”
	“Thou hast been pretty much in my mind since we parted, and I have often remembered that portion of Scripture: ‘The refining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold.’ Various are the probations that are permitted to fall to our share, in this vale of tears. I cannot think, but, if it be not our own fault, they may turn to our lasting advantage, in purging away the dross, the tin, and the reprobate silver. The more deep the trials, the more severe and heavy the refining, reforming hand presses on our souls; the more high they may rise in acceptance, and have the more sensible enjoyments: and then may the soul bow, in the depth of humility, to the root, and know its dependance on that from whence living nourishment springs. Surely the all-wise God hath, for a wise and blessed end, dispensed day and night to our souls, [margin: 9] as well as to the outward creation, to engage and enamour our souls to love Him.”
