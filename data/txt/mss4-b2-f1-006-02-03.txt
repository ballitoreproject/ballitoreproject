My dear James,
+++ O to have a little pure gold in ones own treasury, though it be ever so little, - a little morsel of living bread in one's own house, though it be ever so small a pittance! Those who are so favoured are not like people amazed, & at their wits end, when trouble (the lot of human condition) comes upon them - they have something substantial to have recourse to - they receive all dispensations allotted them, as from a paternal hand, which they are submissively assured, does all things [pg number] 217 right & well - +++ I love to see our dear youth lively & sanguine & feeling in their affections to faithful friends - not cool, distant & indiscriminate in their regards - I hate hardness & impenetrableness - I never see any good come of it.
And now, my dear friend, what shall I say? Thou hast engaged in the active warfare - learn to be a good soldier, & obey the word of command - Dont be thinking ^[pencil] shrinking?^ & skulking behind other peoples bodies - or exceedingly delicate, & saving of own self - but be willing, like David, the Lords ancient, to become yet more vile - & like him to assume the appearance, form & manners of one called to officiate about holy things. Let the sword of the great prophet hew in pieces every species of false delicacy before the Lord.
