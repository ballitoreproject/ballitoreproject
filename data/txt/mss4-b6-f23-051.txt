On a Visit to
PROSPECT near BALLITORE.
Soft link of Nature's powerful chain,
Cement of Souls, Society,
This joyful evening thou shalt reign,
Thou calls'; & &lo, we follow thee.
The North, the South their treasures lend,
A chosen band of hearts sincere;
Come, we'll the smiling hill ascend;
For there resides an happy pair.
Here Nature's various charms conspire,
The strangers' eyes her charms explore,
And some the beauteous babes admire,
And some their beauteous mother more.
To some the joys of former days
Rise glowing, while their partial eyes
Down on the blooming valley gaze,
Where Ballitore sequester'd lies.
"Ye

"Ye roofs, ye shades so long belov'd,
"Where childhood's golden age I knew,
"The rolling years by time remov'd
"Methinks these well-known scenes renew.
"Yes; these renew'd strike on my heart:
"But where are those companions dear,
"Who in each pleasure bore a part?
"Alas! I do not meet them here.
"Some, from these happy plains afar,
"Sleep silent in their early tomb;
"Others, the cruel chance of war
"Untimely crush'd their op'ning bloom.
"Here absence spreads a veil between,
"Which frustrates Friendship's longing eyes,
"While those inflict a wound more keen,
"Who slight, or scorn her tender ties."
Thus

Thus mus'd a +Youth to Nature dear,
And gaz'd on scenes he lov'd so well,
If while he gaz'd, the pious tear
Of tender recollection fell,
The wise may scorn, th'unfeeling blameâ€”
Nor blame, nor scorn, the deed should move:
The tear is virtue's sacred claim,
And *Abell does the tear approve.
For not alone 'tis Abell's part
With wit's bright beam to strike the view,
His better boast a feeling heart
To Truth & Nature firmly true.
Then let the candid bosom glow,
Nor of it's tender sense complain,
For all that selfish aims bestow
Cannot be worth this generous pain. M:S:
