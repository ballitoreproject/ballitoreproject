Celestial Health, thy beaming eyes
Turn to our vows again,
Even tho' our tears, our prayers, our sighs
Invok'd thy smile [deletion]again[/deletion] in vain.
What time thou left our loveliest flowers
To wither in the dust;
So will'd an over-ruling power,
And his decrees are just.
Another blow suspended hung
O'er him, whose glowing heart
Whose glistening eye, whose guileless tongue
Could friendships balm impart.
Tortur'd with pain, with langour prest,
That generous spirit pines,
Yet patience o'er that troubled breast
With sweetest influence shines.
The tender wife, the duteous train,
Whose forms his bourd surround,
The friends, whom Truth's unfailing chain
Have to his spirit bound;

The poor, the helpless, the forlorn,
Behold in silent fear,
For who like him, whose fate they mourn
Can counsel, or can cheer.
But raise your heads in hope again,
For health draws gently nigh,
Our vows were not p[insertion]r[/insertion]eferr'd in vain,
And pain and langour fly! -
