A Dream Dreamt by
Mary Birkett 3 Mo 5th, 1783.
I thought I was born in old
time, and I thought I saw
our Saviour, and I thought
our men in the yard was
the Jews and they wanted to
crucify him in the yard;
and my Father and George
Crane was very much against
it, but however they would
have it done: and they did
crucify him and they got
John the Joiner to make a
cross and they put him thereon
and he anointed

me to be a prophet such
as Elijah or Elisha and
they cut two holes in his
hands and there was an alabaster
hole in one of his hands,
and they asked him what
that was; and he told them
that it was the hole he
put his beard through and
he put it through and shewed
them; and they said
very well and I thought I
cried when they cut the
holes in [insertion]his[/insertion] hands; and when
he was on the cross, I went

down into the sellar and preached
repentance to the people,
and they hearing A noise like
preaching in the house, [insertion]the[/insertion] went
through the rooms and could
not find me; they wanted to
go into the sellar but my Father
and George Crane was
very much against it; however
they went and found me preaching
repentance to A multitude
of people, and I thought
they got A rod and beat
me over my arms very
severely and at last I got to A
country cottage and preached

repentance to the people again
and the men could not
find me; and at last I was
taken poorly and before
I died [deletion]I died[/deletion] I anointed
another in my place, and
then I died. -
The reason I wrote this down
I have several times
dreamt the something like
it
