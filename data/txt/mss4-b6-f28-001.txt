Dear Madam -
I am sorry that Murphy

will discharge her & send her to
The House of Refuge in Baggot
St I will have her received there
& I hope that as she advances
in years she may have sense
& Grace to enable her to congress
whatever faults she has I trust

yielded to - If I did not believe this
to be the case I could not get her

can be admitted there without a
character of honesty & modesty -
