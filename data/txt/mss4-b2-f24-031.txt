My dear Father,

	While my sister Sally was here I refered [sic] to her for communicating to thee of our state, & also I depended on her for intelligence respecting you, of which I was well supplied, now that that is over I am depared [?] of that privilege with the loss of her company, company which was a great consolation & support to me, I admired at the kindness of a good & gracious Helper, who in the course of his Providential ordering of events permitted me to enjoy this favour, for I was very poorly when she came with a violent cough, very heavy with my burden, & yet loath to submit to care, but Sally compeled [sic] me to the latter, & I soon got eased of my cough, my spirits were remarkably depressed, but her sweet converse very much helped to dispel the gloom, so that I could ^hardly^ bear her ought [sic] of my company, & she kindly confined herself to me, & when the trying time arrived she aided then, & so tended & reared me after, that I recovered surprisingly, I was part set to part her [sic], but I struggled against freting [sic], & got pretty much the victory over the grief that secretly assailed me, so that I suppressed the rising tear my [sic] Husband & she went to Cork in the Capriole, they had favourable weather, & he left her well, but I feel for her in the disappointment & loss of dear Samuel Neals Society, as he is going towards Mountmelick, & purposes tarrying some time in your Province. My Husband brings good tidings respecting Cork meeting, thinks that there is evidently a growth in the best Life there, oh could we say it was the case in our meeting too, something seems to hold us Captive, My Kingdom is not of this World said our great pattern, might we seek to be Heirs, to be subject of his peaceable, [sic] Kingdom, & think less of the possession of this World! I was at meeting to day, & also last first day evening, which may say how I am, the infant also seems to thrive, Eliza continues but delicate, uncertain at times how it may ^be^ ordered concerning her, whether her life is to be long, or she ^is^ to be taken in ^infant^ innocency into the World of spirits, there to be happy for ever.
	Abraham was glad of the honour thou did him by thy letter, he applied to his Master to write again, but his Master chose to punish him for bad writing by refusing him this gratification, he (Abraham) tells me to day, his Master says, he is so getting forward in improvement in writing [seal ] he will soon be qualified to write again to his Grandfather; two days ago he gave me thy letter to keep for him, he had it safe in his a book in his pocket, in the evening a stranger took tea with us, & I said it was a pity I had locked it up that he had it not to shew, he said he had it by Heart; & said it off cleverly for us, minding his stops well, & smiling joyously when he repeated your choping [?] latin together; but his Father has got a french [sic] Master for him, wanting to make him complete in that language, if he could, & particularly earnest for it, since he heard of the convincement in France.
	I hope thou wilt excuse this hurried scrawl, as I am really much engaged with my new Nursery, & the other Children, my dear love, (& many grateful acknowledgments) attend thee & my dear Mother for Sallys company, & uniting all in a cordial embrace conclude thy affectionate
	Margaret Grubb
