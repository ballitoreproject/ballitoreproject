London 17th 3rd month 1784


My dear Cousin,
        I was not without fears of having lost thee as a correspondant [sic], judge then how very acceptable thy kind epistle was to mein my (I may almost say) sequesterd situation in respect of my relatives and oldest friends, their remembrance of me is indeed truly consolitary and in some measure alleviates the pain of separation        I am obliged by thy judicious and instructive remarks on the lives and death of my late Cousins - and [sic] I am comforted at hearing that my poor, afflicted, widdow'd [sic] Cousin Mary, is supported to go through her various and complicated trials with such resignationI have felt the threatnings of adversity - but it does not deserve the term, compared to the pangs resulting from a decay of purity in that Character one would wish to dignify - on this ground my Cousin has had my tenderest sympathyI have been absent from Norwich above four months - and am well pleased with my present residence; though the heads of each family are as if they vied with each other in the most delicate and kind attention to me; yet I have by being here many advantages; particularly that of frequent communication with those of my own heart & house, and the opportunity of mixing a little in the society of good friends, I have about once a week a Tete a Tete with my dear John which is indeed highly gratifying to me - Thou art thyself so sensible of true family enjoyment that I have no fear of the subject not being interesting to thee, I dont [sic] know how it is, but, I used to look at writing to thee as a very formidable operation, and now my pen runs with just the same rapidity as it would if I was writing to my dear Debby ChandleeYes, my Sister indulged me with the effusions of Mollys Muse which like the former cannot fail to pleaseMy brother John tells me that Eliza has written to thee very lately so that thou art informed (probably) better than myself how they are at TottenhamI cannot help feeling a great deal of solicitude for my dear Aunt Pike I am told that she looks poorlyI am much pleased with thy account of Molly Dudley - she appears [? under seal] that kind of Teacher that would win to good works-
        The very day following the date of thy letter I find my sister made recompence [sic] for her delay by her two Babes, which she speaks of as very fine ChildrenI am concerned at the many asthmatick attacks my brother Grubb has hadMy Cousin Peggy has indeed been singularly favouredI am highly pleased at thy being able to speak so favourably of all thy Children and theirs, to each of them please give my most cordial & affectionate salutationMy most Respectful regards await thee & thy good Wife
