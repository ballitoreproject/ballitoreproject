31st.. Wednesday The last day of
the old year -. a mild though rather
wet one -. And yet we took our
usual walk [insertion]tho'[/insertion] not very far
This was rather an unprofitable
day - and I am not satisfied with
it - Drew a little before dinner -
Ned surprised me this morning
by suggesting his leaving this
place - and either returning home
for awhile or going to some other
watering place - so that an hour
or so after dinner was devoted to the
consideration of the subject and
writing to Papa.- After this, as
I [deletion]was[/deletion] had just left [deletion]penning[/deletion] my letter Miss
Deasy asked me to play a
game of battledore and shuttlecock
in which we were joined by Mr Matterson
and so passed the evening until
6 1/2 when I came back to Ned -.
6Â½ when I came back to Ned -.
After tea I staid down for awhile
listening to Miss Hannay and
Miss Coad singing -
After breakfast, After tea.
