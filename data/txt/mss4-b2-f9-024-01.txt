From the same to the same
									    Ballitore: 15/1 month 1778
My dear Cousin,
	+++ With respect to America, I am jealous lest some of our active, zealous friends there have been too sanguine for British Government. Even dignified personages in our society when from under the fresh anointing, & meddling with matters out of the line of their proper business, may err in judgement, mistake their duty, & bring on themselves troubles, which the Great Controler of human events would perhaps have made a way for their escaping, if they had cast their care upon him wholly, confided implicitly in him & only maintained, in simplicity, the testimony which we are called to bear against all war & fightings, without busying themselves concerning the right & wrong of the contest. Let that be as it may, our brethren in affliction claim our tender & true sympathy, our prayers & petitions when enabled to offer them. For indeed the time of trial may be nearer to this land than we are aware of: & all the fortitude which we can procure from the author of all good, & the strengthening unity of our friends may be little enough in the day of general calamity.
	I am, my dear Deborah thy affectionate frends & kinsman	Richard Shackleton
