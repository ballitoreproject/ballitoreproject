My dear Ben,
This is but barely to tell thee I received thy valuable letter,
& to enclose my old letter - to say I am recovering from a fever I believe -
not an alarming one - Wm.. not well with a cold - that I have not ability
of mind or body to write now, but hope soon to address thee in our own
way. I do not send the [unclear]prople[/unclear] I promised now, because I expect a
[unclear]pentegraph[/unclear] soon, & want to reduce it first - but I intend next opportunity
after that to send it. I am glad the sweet darling is better. My
dear love to Jane
thine dearly
