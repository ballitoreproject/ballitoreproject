My dear Elizabeth
There is a use sometimes in
giving one a fillup! As soon as I read your
postpaid letter of the 11th or very shortly after
I went to my man of Law. He agreed
pretty much with what you wrote and will
take care that any Articles we may have
to sign will not bind us to the rent. He
says you [unclear]put[/unclear] off TG to the life? I paid
Parker her fee for approving of your [insertion]draft[/insertion] Lease
[deletion]and [/deletion] read it over myself, took it to Ardile
told him to be careful of the Subletting
Act and begged of him as Term ends
[unclear][/unclear] to get both your and Lydia's
lease [unclear]engaged [/unclear] as soon as possible which
he promised. You right then I think to come
up and get your executed at once. All affair
of the sum Concern which require my presence
must take their chance for some days
longer as I am just here for one week
at least. - I hope you will excuse my
having trespassed so much on you, but
I do assure you it did not arise from any
[underline]matters outstanding [/underline] but from a conviction
which [deletion]you[/deletion] I still hold that it would be cause
of satisfaction to you to be of service to Sarah
and to your affectionate brother
EdwD
