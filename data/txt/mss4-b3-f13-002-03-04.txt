Dear friend,
	+++ My wife wrote to thee some time ago, since which we have not had the pleasure of hearing from thee, hope nevertheless that thou art favoured with health & a partaker of serenity of mind, two invaluable blessings. It is a good while ^now^ since we heard from thy ^our^ dear friend, thy husband; if any late accounts be come would be glad to hear of his welfare. I have no doubt but that kind Providence will be his Protector, & I trust He will also be near to comfort & help his near connexions whom he has left behind. Afflictions and trouble are the lot of our nature. Young & old must expect them. I have not found any better palliative under them than patiently to wait & quietly to hope for that effectual cordial, the joy of Gods salvation. Even when old age comes on, & the days in which little natural pleasure is to be expected experienced, this heavely Panacea can renew the verdure of youth on the spirits of the aged; when these wait patiently for, & feel diligently after that Power which alone can by its baptizing virtue wash away the accumulated filthiness of flesh & spirit. If such repent, & be thus baptized, they will doubtless know remission of sins, & the times of refreshment from the presence of the Most High. So will thy be enabled to renew the covenant of their youth, to make an offering of atonement for past transgressions [page number] 190 , & receive a sure earnest while here of a joyful admittance into that everlasting kingdom, into which most certainly none but purified spirits can enter.
	I had little expectation when I began of writing in this manner. I take the liberty to drop what spontaneously occurs, & leave it: am joined by my wife in dear love to thee, & good wishes for all connected with thee, & remain
	thy affectionate friend
