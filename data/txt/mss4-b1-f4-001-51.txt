been increased and strengthened through successive stages of life,
by many a cementing humbling baptism. He has not only been
our own near and dear friend, but the friend, and as it were
father of our children, to whom we know his love has flowed
in a strong current, to their great advantage and comfort. So
that we, to whom the welfare of our children is so dear, we, who
have no greater joy than to see them walk in the truth, as they
advance in years and experience, to be sensible that the Lord
Almighty is preparing them for, and engaging them in His actual
service; [underline]we[/underline], surely, must highly prize such a friend, and
be nearly interested in his present trying situation. However,
we know in whose hand he is; that hand which rescued him
from the jaws of destruction, which led him, and fed him, and
preserved him in heights and in depths, which raised him a
signal monument of His mercies; and having brought him thro'
201
many temptations and tribulations, qualified and commissioned
him to tell others what the Lord had done for his soul: this hand,
though it might be permitted that his natural heart and flesh should
fail, is all all-sufficient to uphold, sustain, and comfort the spirit
and conduct it safely and happily into the mansion prepared for it.
