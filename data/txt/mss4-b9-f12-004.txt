Richmond 18th of April 1826
My dear Sister
I thought to have
written you a less hasty letter
than this, but attention to Lydia
must plead my excuse - She
requires my presence almost
constantly to keep up her spirits
Today the nursetender & I carried
her about the lobby in an arm
chair of my construction & she
was pleased with her jaunt - She
had a look out into the garden
which refreshed her greatly - Her
appetite is not what it ought to
be on recovery from fever - She

rejects the nicest things that she relished
at first - our invention is on
the stretch to find some new tickler
to her palate - Asparagus succeeded
yesterday - In the way of bread is
our greatest puzzle - fresh or stale
toasted or not - she cannot eat it -
She has today got some cakes to
her liking - She takes wine & the
Doctor has ordered her a tonic
medicine, which with her daily
jaunt into the lobby & in a few days
if the weather continue fine into
the garden will I hope bring back
her liking for food- Her rest is not
as good as it was - She is extremely
weak - three steps are a journey
to her - She has been up & dressed
in her wrapper for a few hours

every day these three days-
Joze is in excellent health
& in good care at Summerville - Mary
thriving & merry - The recollection
of little Richard Whites death haunts
Lydia & makes her desire to keep
both the children away from her -
for a long time to come she says
she cannot touch them - It is very
pleasant to hear of Eben's recovery
My dear Sarah I hope you are
yourself gaily - & may long continue
so - Oh that we could see you
here - Sally must give up the
meeting as we could not spare her
but I expect she will visit you before
summer is over - Her very
dear love to you & Edward, in
which I heartily join
Yours ever
JS Fisher
