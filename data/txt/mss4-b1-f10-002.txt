M. Brooks had a dream in the beginning of the Year 1776, wherein
she thought she saw the sky of a blue colour as in a serene Summers
Evening, on which small white Clouds formed Words in Verse
of a considerable length, & were she thinks a relation of all the remarkable
Occurrences that have since happened in America: on her
waking the whole was taken from her except the first two words
of each of the two first lines; which were the Kings Name (George)
& England, & altho' a refreshing Savour of divine Virtue covered
her Spirit, & a Sense remained of the Lord's Regard to England,
yet a Fear seized her, lest the King's Person was in Danger, &
this brought a Weight of Exercise over her Mind for about eight
Days, at the end of which one evening her heart was melted
under a favoured Sense of the flowing of divine Love, which
brought great Sweetness, Calmness & Peace over her, & a perfect
stilness ensuing, she heard the Lord's voice as distinctly as
ever she heard any outward Language, pronounce the following
words in the secret of her mind viz. -
"I will shew thee things to come, great & mighty is the King
of Kings; the Lord of the whole Earth, by him Kings reign &
Princes decree Justice. My Power shall subdue the Kings
Enemies, and he shall know that I rule over the Kingdoms of
Men; thou hast seen his Name written on high, & the Nation
whom I will defend. No Enchantment against it shall prosper,
nor Divination prevail: I will restore Princes into her Borders,
& will exalt my own Name in the destruction of Hypocrites,
for the day of their Visitation is ended, who have lifted themselves
up against my Providence, & the King that I have set over them,
& tho' they swear the Lord liveth, verily they swear falsely."
