How pleasing this intercourse, my dear Molly, to
a person of acute feelings, but alas! how distressing is it
when the channel is obstructed; since I by turns experience
such joy & disquiet as I partake or am debarr'd of the
kind notice of my Friends. By the date of thy letter I suppose
it was written long before it was sent: I hope thou wilt
not again hesitate about a proper mode of conveying thy
letters to me when inclined to devote a few moments
to my entertainment which I find is not to be too frequently
I thank thee for the Poems one of which I return but had
not time to transcribe the other yet. I shall from time to
time request a fresh supply as those, your kind letters,
& now & then a page in some book constitute my sole
amusement. To the latter I can allow but very little time as
I am not become master of my business Blair's Sermons
shall come in course if I can procure them here. As I
am but ill qualified for Society, wanting conversation, to

commend me I can have but few opportunities of getting
me I can have but few opportunities of getting
into company that would not be unsuitable without being
an obtruder. I had the pleasure of seeing Becky Grubb at
the meeting time, her Father & Sam, but none other of thy particular
Friends from Cork or Clonmel I did not know Nancy
Grubb though I dined in her company until thou told me
her name. I looked among the Cork lads in vain for one
that answered thy description. You will have a good deal
of Friends at this season I suppose as the weather is so
pleasant for travelling My Masters G&WP & latter's fair
Spouse will I suppose take a couple of nights lodging
at Ballitore apropos I never gave thee my opinion of
my employers. My respected Friend George is but seldom
in town except just on meeting days whenever he sees me
he speaks in a very friendly manner, Billy (so called to
distinguish him from another of the same name in town)
& Rachel from the very beginning behaved to me with all
the politeness due to a stranger & from their demeanor to
the

rest of the lads I have reason to hope it will continue
so I have good reason to be perfectly satisfied with my
situation She comes into the Office almost every night
& chats freely with us & so did Pim Nevins' agreeable Wife
Pim was rather distant. Dost thou ever read any French
now or attempt to revive O Fons Bandusia. I intend when
I have time to go to a French Master for a quarter or two
to teach me to speak. Pray remember me affectionately
to Uncle, Aunt, Sally, & every individual of the Family.
If Mary Hudson should speak about payment for the
needles pray let her know A Finley has laid some
[unclear]money[/unclear] for my acco't & knows of some trifle I [unclear]own[/unclear]
[unclear][/unclear] request she may give the 7/6 to him.
I send a couple of Franks that thou may make use
of when thou pleases which I hope will not be long distant
