Ballitore 14th of 2mo: 1826
To Edwd. Maguire
In reply to thy letter recd. this morning — The
reason I wished thee to see the copy of the original Lease
under which the late Abram Shackleton derived, was that
thou might make the clause of renewal, in my renewal
With Lydia L. &c just like that in the original Lease
from Strettel to Carter, that is all that can be altered in
my Lease I belve. - The Shackleton's hold between 30 &
40 Acres of Land under the Repvs. of Strettel, part of this
Holding about 1 1/4 Acre including houses & Gardens, the late
A.S. let to me at £18:11 [unclear][/unclear] yearly, & a small part of
said Holding under A.S. I let to Thos. Bewley, by Lease
[unclear]renewable[/unclear] for ever at £20 [unclear]pr[/unclear] Ann: as may be seen by
Thos Bewley's Lease from me — The Renewals down
from 1727 have been regularly executed, I have no doubt
of; they are I suppose in L. S's possession, & the last
renewal being not yet expired, perhaps 3 years of it yet
to run, & when that is the case; & by the will of the late
A.S. Lydia S. & her daughters are entitled & impowered to
renew with [insertion]me:[/insertion] I apprehend so at least; & then I renew with
Thos. Bewley — Lydia S. administered to her late husbands
will — I copy over the description of the primes leased
to me by the late A.S— & also the description of the primes
I let to Thos. Bewley, out of those primes; so that it will
be seen I have not let my part to Thos. Bewley contrary
to my Lease from the late A.S. — I dont want any more
land to be inserted in my renewal, than is in my Lease

especially as I let no Land to Thos. Bewley —
From A.S. to W.L.
All that & those the + dwelling house offices & Garden lately
occupied by Abigail Widdows & now in the possession of the
sd. Wm. Leadbeater & Pierce Power, with that part of the field
adjoining sd. Holdings now inclosed by a [unclear]ditch[/unclear] contain.g 1/2 an
Acre of thereabouts be the same more or less, also the Holdings
now occupied by James Lyons, & that lately held by the widow
Miles, now in the sd. Wm. Leadbeater's possession situate in the
Town of Ballitore aforesd. & bounded on the North by Abram
S's Land, on the East by the River Griese, on the South
by the Street of Ballitore, & on the west by Thos. Murry's Garden,
that part of Abigail Widdow's houses adjoining in the Burrow &
Edwd. Kenedy's Holding formerly called Taylor's Orchard To
have & to hold &c.
From W. L to Thos. Bewley - extract
& by these presents doth demise, grant, set & to farm let unto the
sd. Thos. Bewley, in as full & [insertion]as[/insertion] ample a manner as the sd. Wm. Leadbeater
can render his Lease from Abram Shackleton by which he holds
the same, & All that & those the Dwelling house offices & Garden, situate
on the North side of the Market place of Ballitore & bounded on the
north by Abram Shackleton's land, on the South by the Street of
Ballitore, & the tenements & holdings of the sd. Wm. Leadbeater, on the
East by Wm. Leadbeater's Yard & Haggart, & on the West by the
Holding formerly called Taylors Orchard, & extending from front to
[unclear]cure[/unclear] one hundd. & seventy nine feet, breadth in the [unclear]rere[/unclear] ninety
five feet, be the same more or less: To have &c —
θ Where Thos. Bewley lately lived
+This is where W.L now lives

Now I will copy clause of renewal in my Lease from
the late A.S. viz
And the sd. Am Shackleton doth for himself & for his Heirs
Exrs. Admrs. & assigns exact promise & grant to & with the sd.
Wm. Leadbeater his Heirs Exrs., Admrs. & assigns by these presents
that he the sd. Abram Shackleton his Heirs & assigns shall & will at
the expiration of sd. terms of twenty one years hereby granted at the
request, cost & charges the sd. Wm. Leadbeater his Heirs Exrs. Admrs.
[insertion]or assigns[/insertion] make & perfect unto him & them a new Lease of the sd. primes hereby
demised, for the term twenty one years to commence from the
expiration of the sd. term of twenty one years hereby granted under
the like rent, covenant [insertion]condss[/insertion] agreemts. herein contained & in like
manner from time to [unclear]time[/unclear] successively forever, at the expiration
of every twenty one [unclear]years[/unclear] at the like request costs & charges of
the sd. Wm. Leadbeater [unclear][/unclear] Heirs Exrs. Admrs. or assigns —
Now whatever further [unclear][/unclear]necessary to this clause, & to have it
inserted as often as [insertion]is[/insertion] necessary, is, I belve., all we can do with my
Lease, with regard to [unclear]m[/unclear] Renewal — I am not bound to
do anything more for Thos. Bewley than my Lease from
the late A.S. enables me to do, as thou may see from the
beginning of my Lease to Thos. Bewley —
I have another Lease from the late A.S.
of all the remaing. Holdings [unclear]long[/unclear] I to him
in the Burrow of Ballitore renewable
forever — WL
thy frd.
Wm. Leadbeater
