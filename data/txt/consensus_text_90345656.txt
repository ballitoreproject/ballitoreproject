26 Tuesday - Went to town as it was
settled that I should go down to Moone
with Isabel on Wednesday -
Cha went this evening to a party
at Moorefield also Patrick Shackleton
who came up today - Poor Richard
is laid up with a swelled face, and
the Doctor said it might be erysipelas
Isabel ought not to leave him if so,
I think - I drove out to see
her but she thinks she will be able
to go -
27 Wednesday - [insertion]morning[/insertion] Charlie awoke me
at 4 this morning just fresh from
the party -
Isabel came at about 12 all ready
to start as Richard would not let
her stay and had Miss Holland
to mind him -
