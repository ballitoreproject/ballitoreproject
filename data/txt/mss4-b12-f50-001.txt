Sandford Grove
27. VIII. 1863
Dear Cousin
I duly received thy letter
yesterday -
I am hoping to come on to
Ballytore on 3rd day next
and if friends there have no
objection it would be pleasant
to meet them in their weekday
meeting for worship if it could be
held on 4th day instead of 5th
at the usual hour or any other if
more convenient to them - of which
notice cd be given on 1st day --
my intention is to stay 2 nights at
Inesmount - and go forwards
on 5 day morning to Carlow to the
meeting there - requesting them to hold
their meeting on 5th instead of 4th day

to go from Carlow to Kilnock to
lodge - and on 6th day to go by
train to Waterford arriving 6th day
night or Evening -
Visit the School on 7 day and
stay 1st day at Waterford - thence
on 2nd day to Cork - and farther
I cannot clearly see -
I should have liked to have
staid a day longer with you - but
It seems almost more than I
can suitably devote to [underline]social[/underline] Enjoy.t
merely -
I think of leaving Dublin
on 3rd day by train due at Athy
at 2.30 - perhaps it would not be
asking too much that if not inconvenient
it would be very pleasant to me if
Mary could come to meet me -
at Athy -
I have had a cold and a hoarseness
which friends here thought it best for me
to nurse by a days rest [deletion]but[/deletion] [insertion]and[/insertion] it is
now much better - well, I may say -

Should any local circumstances
markets or other things render
these arrangements unsuitable
of course they must give way and
friends not be inconvenienced
perhaps thou would kindly write
to me at Sam Bewley's Dame St
by return or as soon as convenient
to acquaint me -
With love to thy wife and the
dear children include of course
dr Hank j.
thy affect. Cousin
Joseph Thorpe
would thou think it well
to correspond with Mary Jas[unclear]deedy[/unclear]
as to the best arrangements --
so that I reach Waterford 6th day eves
