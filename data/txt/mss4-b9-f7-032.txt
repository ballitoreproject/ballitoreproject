Dublin April 6th 1829
My dear Elizabeth
I doubt not you are
anxious to hear how we get on here
and at the Glen as it is a week
since I wrote to you. Sarah has
got on very well tho' not so
quickly as upon the trust of 
E E B. She was up yesterday for
a while and expects to be able to
return to town some day this week
weather permitting. The other children
are pretty well. Please tell Debh.
I recd. her kind letter; I think it
would be a pity to separate the children
at present, but Sarah expects soon to
write to her on the subject, I took forward
to visiting you myself shortly if I can do so
I have got your money [insertion]letter[/insertion] with its [unclear]cont[/unclear] correct also
for Sarah yours EB
The young chap is I suppose to be
as Richard tho [unclear]offered[/unclear]fully
intend to introduce a [unclear]nice[/unclear]
name into the Family
you will let Deb.h know how
we are as soon as you can
and am writing to you now
& consider if also address her
