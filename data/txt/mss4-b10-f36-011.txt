26th of 10th mo - 1832.
My dear Eliza
As there is an opportunity tomorrow
I sit down to write thee a few lines, as I am
too late for the post tonight, and tomorrow
I could not do so. On fifth day morning
Betsy B returned from Waterford rather unexpectedly,
she came sooner than she intended
on account of the American Friends coming
this way, they did not go round by Clonmell
as she had intended. John Wilber & Charles
Osborne came on fifth day night with J Richardson
as guide, they are two very odd looking
men, very old looking [insertion]for their age[/insertion] & weather beaten, and
seem delicate particularly C. Osborne, who reminded
me greatly of the [underline]trapper[/underline] in that
novel of Cooper's that we were reading some time
since, The week day meeting was put off
untill this morning (sixth day) on their account,
they lodge here, and seem agreeable
men, one of them smokes, the fumes of his
tobacco are regaling my nose at present,
as he is taking a whiff before he goes to bed.
we had a pretty large company to dinner

 to day J Forbes & Margt. Neale, were here, the
former was telling us of a very dismal occurrence
that had taken place yesterday morning
near his place, the clergyman of their
parish was shot dead, he had gone out to look
at two men who were digging his potatoes
a short distance from his house, and was
shot by some people who had waylaid him
it is supposed it was on account of his forcing
the payment of tithe, it is a dismal thing
to hear of such things. We spent this evening
at the school where there was a large company
the friends go [insertion]a[/insertion]way tomorrow, J Wilber goes
to Rathangan, & C Osborne to Dublin, where
he is going to recruit, for a short time. I
expect J Richardson will take this, as he offered
to take any thing I had to send.
I have not yet said any thing about home
I got thy short note on fourth day morning
thou said Emmy had a very heavy cold
I hope it is better, and that she may be
quite well ere this, thou wilt let me know
I expect if it is the contrary, poor Lucy I suppose
was very anxious and uneasy, it was
rather unfortunate that Aunt Jane should
be laid up at the time, does Manny [unclear]Kinneer[/unclear]

answer; thou told me very little of Manliff
is he able to be up yet, tell me more particularly
when thou writes next, thou likes to hear
every thing thyself, I hope I may have good news
how is my dear Mother is her cold quite
well, I am glad Patty is with you, tell her
that Betsy B saw Gretta and that she is very
well. I have said nothing about going home
because I dont know what to say, I do not
intend to stay long at the Mill, perhaps
it might happen that I would not go there
at all as I hear they are to have visitors soon,
and I believe they would not have
room [unclear]ho[/unclear]wever I do not know how
it will be settled. Elizabeth told me
that Sally Barrington was on a visit
at Alexander's and Sarah said [deletion]that[/deletion] in her
letter that Sally was going to spend three
weeks at the Glen, it is very pleasant to
hear she is so well, I hope going out there
will do her good. Does my Mother think
I am staying too long from home, it will
be five weeks on second day next, since I
left home, how fast the time slips over, give
my dear love to my Mother and tell her as
soon as ever she wishes me to go I am ready.
Dear love also to Manliff & others, & Frederic, not
forgetting thyself and [unclear][/unclear]tty write soon and tell me
every thing, particularly [unclear][/unclear] dear little Emy - and
Manliff. give my love to Frank & Lucy and tell
the latter I think she might have written to me
We heard here that Jane Harvey Reuben's wife
was not expected to recover of cholera, didst thou
hear of it - Betsy B & Elizth send their love
farewell and believe me thine
Sincerely Selina
