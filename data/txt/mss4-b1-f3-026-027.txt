					Dublin 2nd of Fifthmonth 1769
	Dear Cousin D. C.
		After a sinking, low, distressing season of inward poverty this morning, a degree of consolation springing up, and thou therein, and they extraordinary care of me in my old age and widowhood, being brought into remembrance,  I venture to address myself to thee in a few lines, wishing thee better health than thou hast had of late, and, what I am sure is far more desirable, that thou mayst be favoured with divine and heavenly peace: this is what sweetens all our bitter cups. My health of body is pretty much better these two days, and I am thinking of setting forward with my friends towards the yearly meeting. Whether I may be favoured to return to poor Ireland, i shid from me: I cannot see it. However, I desire humbly to confide in Him who is able to help to the last, and in every difficulty.
	My dear love attends my grandchildren, and if I should not live to see them again, I wish them well. They have tender and religious parents and friends also to watch over them. Oh! religion is a heart-work indeed: may we all diligently, in very deed, labour for that peace that passeth the understanding of the natural, unregenerate man. Our meeting is now quite over: it hath been a season of consolation and inward advantage, I hope, to many.
	And now, I desire, my dear friend, that grace, mercy, and peace, and the fruits of the Spirit, may be enjoyed by thee, and abundantly multiplied in thy breast.
							A. S.
