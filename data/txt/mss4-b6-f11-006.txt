My dear friend
I was very much
gratified by your sending
me the lines on the death
of our excellent friend, I
forwarded the copy to my
father, & in his last letter
to me he says "I was greatly
pleased with ML's lines on
the death of AS -. They are
serious & pathetic, & as become
the occasion & her situation
as to years. I like
poetry from the heart, as

this evidently is, plaintive,
feeling & appropriate. Communicate
to her the remembrance
of my love, & say
that I am obliged to her for
sending the copy. Would she
object to my sending it
for insertion to the Editor
of the Monthly Repository
of theology & general literature?"
I was very glad to
hear that you continue
to recover, & I hope before
long to hear of your complete
restoration to health.
Sarah Jane has just
a tooth & continues to
as well as possible -
With dear love to all
your family, including
Eben & Deborah, I am
Your truly affectionate
S H Haughton
