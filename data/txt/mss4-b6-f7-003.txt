Dear M.L: It is of some importance to me to get this letter
speedily [insertion]& safely[/insertion] conveyed to Carlow, & I confide in thy good nature
to assist me in it, - I am able to be about, tho' often thro'
difficulty, for whatever ailed me all along is still hanging about
me, perhaps it may be " the young disease that will subdue at
length" but of this all is obscure farewell very cordially
