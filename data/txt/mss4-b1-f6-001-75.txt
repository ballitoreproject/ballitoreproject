My Dear Sir/ Fort George. North Britain
August ye 6th 1788
Your favor of the 22nd of last month, to be fowarded
by Messrs. Ross & Ogilvie, I reced this day - it is my most
sincere wish that the money due to you by Mr. R: Eyre
& myself was paid, I certainly agree with you that it is
high time it shoud, and if my plan had been attended

been liquidated - I have no reason to suppose nor
doubt the sincerity of Mr. R: E:s professions to you, and

of my [underline]sincerity[/underline]: Our joint property in the Town
and County of Galway, is annually between £70 & £80
and [deletion]are[/deletion] [insertion]is[/insertion] as punctually, & [deletion]as[/deletion] properly paid as any rents
in the universe - Mr. R: E: you say inform'd you, he had
rec'ed no money these two years out of that country, it
may be so, I know nothing of his money matters, but certain
it is, he might if he pleas'd - I have reced nothing for nearly
these [underline]four years[/underline], but my Agent (Mr. Ruxton) has, and
his last account to me, I find myself credited with
upwards of [underline]Sixty pounds Ster.[/underline] which money tho' much
as I may have wanted it, I have not ventur'd to touch
as I shou'd rather suffer a temporary inconvenience
than
