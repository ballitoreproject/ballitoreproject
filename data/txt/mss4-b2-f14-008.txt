From Richard Shackleton to Abiah Darby

My dear friend,

When I have left Coalbrookdale I think myself in duty bound to give my dear friends there some account of myself. I conclude that those who receive & entertain me with so much kindness & hospitality must interest themselves in my safety after I have parted from them. On this principle, I sit down to inform thee that having left dear Yuky Appleby & our friends at Shrewsbury, our triumvirate went several stages & lodged at an inn that night, then rose early the next morning & reached Holyhead in the evening, just in time to go on board the Clermont-packet-we sailed about Ten oclock at night with a fair wind & a fair prospect of breakfasting next morning in Dublin- but (such is the uncertainty & fallacy of human prospects) the wind fell away & there was a great calm: so that we were about 26 hours on the water: however, through the favour of kind Providence, we got well over & on third-day night or fourth day morning I was let in to my lodgings at Thomas Bewleys East Streets. On 6th day I rode in company with several friends to our province meeting at Wicklow, the last meeting of that description, which (by a late regulation) may perhaps be held in this nation. By the discontinuance of these six-weeks ^province^ meeting, it is to be hoped that our Quarterly meetings will be held to better effect. This Wicklow-meeting was well attended- It was I hope held to satisfaction, inded last First day about noon- my son & I took horse pretty directly after meeting & rode home, above thirty Irish miles that afternoon. We were favoured to get safe & to find our families well, except my wife, whose rheumatick disorder (I fear) increases, though she is much better than she had been at times in my absence- her strength & spirit are better- she walks about the house & garden- gets to meetings at home, & the heart being rightly bent will, I hope, at times be strengthened to get to meetings at a distance from home. I did not omit to communicate to her thy pledge of love, which made a good and pleasing impression. Thus I have given thee a detail-

Thus have I told thee all my state, & brought
My story to the sum of earthly bliss
Which I enjoy. ...&c
In return I would be glad to hear from any of you, how thou art, how & when the residue of thy family returning from London got home- whether our other dear friends from the Dale, left at London, & outward bound, have yet proceeded on their errand of supernal grace. Surely that Debby Darby is accumulating great piles of treasure in heaven- I hope it will be long ere she go thither to enjoy it. I am glad Richard Reynolds is inclined to be a co-partner in the business- it is a glorious commerce, & they are an honourable company indeed who are engaged in it. +++ My wife & children join me in cordial salutation to thee, & to such of their friends there as they have the pleasure of being acquainted with. Be pleased, my dear ^& respected^ friend to accept of this tribute of love & gratitude from thy affectionate friend
Richard Shackleton.
