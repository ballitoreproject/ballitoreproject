Limerick 13th of March 1831
My dear Sarah
If by any possibility
Lydia should not yet have set out
this will tell her & you that our little
boy passed a more favourable night &
the dangerous symptoms seem lessened.
We cannot but admit that still his
ultimate recovery is in the scale, as the
seat of his disorder is the head & that water
in the brain is so much to be dreaded in
its fatal issue. Dear love to Edward
of his & your sympathy we are [unclear]convinced[/unclear]
I am with much affection
Yours ever
S.J. Fisher
