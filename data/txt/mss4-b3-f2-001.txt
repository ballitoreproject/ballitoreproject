Clonmel 3rd Mo. 14th 1792
My dear Father 	
       Before I received thy Letter dated 2 mo 5th Thomas Eyre had removed hence to New Geneva where he is now quartered, I understood from him before he left this place, that he waas likely to be in Dublin about this time, his Wife went direct from this to that City, so that its likely thou will see him before I shall, but if I shoud see him before he leaves this province I purpose having some conversation with him on the subject thou mentions; & if my Margaret was not in her present situation I think I woud go to Geneva for the purpose. Captain Eyre has at times conversed with me about his Brother & from what I recollect he condemned his Brothers conduct to thee; but there is now a Law suit depending that is likely to be ended in the course of a few Months, when it is supposed the two Brothers will come in for a large property sum of money in right of their Brother Samuel  If Thomas was inclined to purchase I believe he has the means  I woud not recommend they selling to Powell except Cash was got for the Bond before it was assigned to him, as thou might at the end of 9 Months be as far from receiving the 100 as thou art now from the entire sum  I do not know that getting a Costodian [sic] woud be attended with much trouble or expense, but I can inform thee more fully on this head when I consult those who know most about it & expect to have a favourable opportunity in a few days when our Assizes commences  my not having this in my information and not seeing Captain Eyre since I received they letter caused my silence, & I suppose I shoud not now write but was fearful thou might conclude my silence proceeded from not attending to thy or Commission.  We have been for several days past in the enjoyment of dear Sarah Waters agreeable company which we prize much, & added to this our Dear Sally Shackleton arrived here well last evening, so that Peggy is now highly set up, & is thro the kindness of Providence favored with good health & spirits  No doubt you have been informed of dear Mary Dudleys movements in the County Cork, she returned timely to our province Meeting & last 5th day communicated to several Friends of this Province (our mo meeting held to this time on account of an appointment made to revise some account of the services &c. of [word struck through] Sister SRG) of a concern she was under to have ^a^ publick Meeting in the town of Carrick which friends approving of encouraged her therein, so on 1st day last she was there with many more female Friends from hence, say [?] Elizabeth Pim, Anne Tuke, Anne Broadhead, & Sarah Lynes *all of whom with herself spoke in public, she [word torn away] I understand extraordinary speaking more than one hour, the people behaved well considering the great number that were there, & full as many more were (or Ii am informed I was not there) gathered, but coud not get into the house for want of convenient room, & we had our Meeting at home in which our Peggy was in my opinion much favored. Mary [word struck through] Watson & [illegible] Davis from Waterford intended being at Carrick, but about 1 ? miles from their home they met a great Number of Pigs, & tho they stopped their cab till they woud pass, yet I suppose some of them got under the wheel of their chair, by which means they were overset, & [illegible] Davis was hurt, so they returned to Waterford being unfit to proceed to Carrick
My Margaret with the two Sarahs our Anne & my Dear Love is to thee my Mother Brothers & Sisters
		Thy truly affectionate Son
