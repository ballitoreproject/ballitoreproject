Dublin: 4 November 1769.


Dear Abby,


        I write at the instance of Molly Pemberton whom her brother Handy has importuned to enquire of me whether I think there would be any probability of thy consenting to accompany him to France: I told her that thou wert a high young man (fortis & animosus), that thou would accept of no Gratuity on any such consideration: but that as thou had an inclination thyself to travel, I did not doubt but that on Handys making proper [beginning of word crossed out] ^applic^ation, & advancing thee a Sum of money on thy Note, that thou would go with him: or to this purpose. So she is to write to Handy; & he is to apply to thee, to know if thou be willing. As far as I can learn, he is much bent upon getting thee, & has his excuse ready for not applying sooner, & trying elsewhere. This Scheme also seems agreeable to his Sister. I doubt not thy ready compliance. I would not have thee get cloacks [?] here, for any sort are good enough to travel with & wear on ship-board: when thou gets to France, thou may get them made alamode [sic] Francois.
        Now, Dear Abby, if this long dream of visionary happiness comes to be realized to thee (which I hardly expected), assume the Mein of Virtue, of Stability & prudent Conduct: join it to the Man of Good-Sense & Observation: & this little Tour may be fraught with pleasure & instruction, unmixed with that alloy which arises from illicit gratifications of any sort, & dashes all our happiness. Remember what our friend Pope says
        What nothing earthly gives, or can destroy
        The Souls calm Sunshine & the heart-felt Joy
        Is Virtues Prize
Excuse me that I still retain the Right of a Preceptor. I write in haste: & am very ill-situate [sic] for dictating Letters of morality, being much annoyed by a couple of Ballad-singers exercising their talents just by the window of the office where I am writing
        Thine affectionately
                Richard Shackleton.
