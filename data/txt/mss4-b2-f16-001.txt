Coalbrook Dale 18th 10 month 1790

Dear Friend
Thy very acceptable letter was received, giving a welcome account of your safe arrival at your desired homes, for which I was very thankful to the Father of mercys for the great preservation, for which I earnestly interceeded [sic] might ^be^ your happy experience; and altho so long in replying, it was not for want ^of^ have^ing^ you much in my rememberance, indeed in all our thoughts, taking thy writing us as a real mark of true Friendship, and affectionate regard, my Eyes being very indifferent, I could not write myself without much fatigue, and my daughter Sarah was from home on a destressing [sic] occasion, of which thou knows we were in expectation  [handwriting change] thus far my Dear Friend ^is^ my Dear Mothers indicting  I stayed with my dear Brother and Sister Rathbone, near five weeks after leaving at the time when thou was at the dale, and then returned home, where after staying some weeks I went again to them understanding my dear Brother appeared to be near his close, which I found to be the case, for I reached them on Sixth^Fifth^ day, and the Seventh day night following he death approached fast, so that the same night about half past one he breathed his last without any strugle [sic], he told me as soon as I saw him I was come to his funeral, and to S. Appleby who accompanied me, I believe when we meet again it will be in heaven, being sensible of his close drawing near, and to his last quite sensible altho not capable of speaking: he has left a widow who sincerely mourns his loss, indeed to ^us^ all it seems likely we may ever deeply feel the striping [sic] of such a friend, I trust the Holy Arm of Power will be near my Beloved Sister and that she may at length witness a calm to which she is at present a stranger; to that Rock of Strength it is my desire to be continually looking, and I may say my mind has been wonderfully supported in a calmness not to be expressed, thro the various trying engagements I have had to pass thro I some times admire [?] I could get thro, but I know it is not of myself, ot him therefore be the Praise whose right it is  thy kind rememberance of us in a letter, my dear Brother Reynolds lately received, afresh calls for acknowledgements and makes us still more in thy debt; the information therein respecting your ardious [sic] engagement of visiting the Lords Family, in your Land  did good to some of our spirits, to observe the Master is still remembering his captive seed, such labour is often peculiarly Blessed to individuals  the account of our dear Friends upon the Continent is very comfortable, surely it is the Lords work and therefore it must prosper, the Divine Illumination seems to be more and more spreading amongst the Nations, Oh! that it may saith my Soul till darkness is wholly swallowed up thereby, to the turning all from the shadow to the true substance  my dear Mother is weakly, but is generally enabled to get to meeting, and is mostly sitting with her mind sweetly waiting upon her Lord, and I think may be said is fulfilling that injunction of watching unto Prayer  my dear Sister Deborah has been set out upon a Journey of Visiting Yorkshire with her companion R. Young now some time, they are now at Sheffield visiting families and ^have^ the evidence as they pass along of being in their places  my Dear Brother Reynolds is lately returned from a Journey thro Wales by appointment, he finds the professors of truth few in number, and but a small part of the few who seem to be concerned to bear a faithfull testimony for the most blessed cause on earth  We have the company of Mary Barris [?] and her niece Mary Lloyd at our house, the latter has been poorly, is now rather better again, we are pleased with their company; they write with me, as does my dear Mother, Sister Rathbone, Brother Samuel, S. Appleby, in dear love to thee thy dear wife, and to all thy truely [sic] valuable Family as tho named
from thy truely [sic] affectionate Friend Sarah Darby
our love is to all inquirers
A. Summerland rather poorly tho gets out to meeting 
thy letter to Sister D. D. was sent to her
