Unwillingness to let blank paper
cross the channel, rather
than any thing worth communicating,
prompts me
to say my dear Betsy how
very consoling it is to us
all to hear of our dear little
niece's recovery- I had
entirely given her up, &
often blamed myself for
not being satisfied oh
if ever I shall see her
how delightful [unclear]twill[/unclear] be
I need not say that even
she trusted here what
little I could do, would
joyfully be done for her
but of this favour I dare
not indulge a hope-
Nurses are torments
in many ways but if
thro' your nurse's agency
Sarah can be reared, we
shall all feel thankful.
[unclear]Mihite's[/unclear] child is lovely
really handsome & most
sweet-looking.

My dear Deborah's & Betsy's joint letter arrived
this morning, bringing tidings of good
cheer. That Deborah could take such a walk,

health. But the nurse does not seem quite agreeable

the want of attention to cleanliness is inexcusable,
& may retard the infant's recovery. It is
generally thought here, that if the child thrives,
the openness of the bowels may be an effort of
nature to carry off the remains of disease. Now
it has occurred to us that if Kitty, whom Eliz
mentioned, Sarah's former servant went over,

perhaps you would find her more agreeable

sleep in Eliz's room which is warm, being over the kitchen. [unclear][/unclear]
consider this proposal. If the weather was cool there is the room
over the shop with a fire place where she could be quite snug & cozy.
Eliz bids me add that nothing in her power shall be wanting.
I see thy handwriting so steady, so clear, & the composition so good,
that I really think thou might contribute something to the Monthly
magazine, & so might Eben & Betsy, & win a little gold as well as fame,
without blazoning yourself in publick as author. Sure when Hugh
Clarke got a guinea, as he said he did, for a sonnet for Campbell's Magazine
what would not yours be worth? He sent the verse, he says, & called
at the office, could not see the principal, but the clerk handed him a guinea
Dear Deborah, do not be offended, but take this in earnest or jest as thou pleases,
but I would do the like if I could. Till Betsy mentioned it to Hannah I had
not heard of [unclear]Sol[/unclear] & Lydia remaining at Richmond, nor heard any thing about
it from them. I am much pleased at this determination, & my mind
relieved thereby, as to that circumstance. Anne D. Grubb had a splendid
wedding- such as for many years, if ever, was seen in Clonmel among
friends. It was the day her dear aunt Chandlee was laid in her grave.
It had been deferred a week because of Jane Lucas's death, & it was spoken
of deferring it on this occasion, but the places being so distant it was
of deferring it on this occasion, but the places being so distant it was
concluded not to do so. Sophia was a gentle, attentive attendant on my
dear sister. She is now waiting on Hannah Doake, who is very poorly, I
know not whether to remain there. Now my dear Debh. I will leave
thee to chat a while with Betsy. Best love to Eben ever thy ML
My dear Betsy/
What dost thou think of thy Aunts & Elizabeth's proposal
they are very anxious it shou'd meet your approbation, the best
way of putting it in practice I hope somebody will be able to [unclear][/unclear] out
as for the expense of sending her, I am quite willing to undertake
that, to relieve you from the variety of painful, offensive feelings
which it seems to me allmost impossible [insertion]for you[/insertion] to submit to, it is a sad thing
that no respectable Woman cou'd be got, & strange indeed, that custom
shou'd have so far blinded any as to reconcile them by employing such
characters to countenance vice (except in a case of necessity like
yours) I pity Eliza very much to be exposed to the shameless conversation
of that Woman I hope you are all endeavouring to do her good, & make her
sensible of her depravity- next to wishing to send the Nurse, I want to [unclear]make[/unclear]
the cosz about expenses, thy worth both Eben & Deborah considered inestimable
as we think, yet it belongs to me, as far as I can, to remove every burden
from the mind, by putting it in the power to pay (perhaps a guinea a
week) for thy board, or more if thou likes, cou'd you arrange another,
so as to have an additional room, thou shou'd do what thou can
to recruit both health & spirits; What of the Dudbys; I long to hear
what New friends you have got. did thou go to see Mary Slater, or Dr
[unclear]Newgate[/unclear], to see & [unclear]hear[/unclear] Elizabeth [unclear][/unclear]- George [unclear]intends[/unclear] writing tomorrow
To Eben, so he can desire him to pay thee 10 or 12 on my acct & when
the season, & other circumstances, cheers us in the hope of thy return
thou will require a fresh supply for traveling- & thou must want
many articles for thyself- Eliza I am also obliged to for her attention to thee
I know not whether thou will meet my old friend Hannah [unclear][/unclear] of [unclear]Isteram[/unclear]
Julia Gun's Sister, some say she is a stately lady- she was a very agreeable
girl, a friend of Sister Chandees, how [unclear][/unclear] poor Beckys house looks,
high & low lament this loss- Anna O I saw in bed today she has been several
day very ill but is rather better many enqueries when thou will return
Hannah Houghton sends dear love [unclear][/unclear] much wanting
I will write with pleasure to [unclear]T.[/unclear] [unclear][/unclear] if agreeable to you [unclear][/unclear] thou forbidden me to do so?
I am very [unclear][/unclear] head [unclear][/unclear] this must go to night
I am thy very affectionate Mother [unclear][/unclear] S

Thy sweet Hannah is quite an important
personage- Elizabeth's love for her is intense
said Elizth. seems to have lost her irritability
& is like an angel- I never saw a gentler child.
I am glad thou seest thy way out of England,
travelling under the care of the Irish
Representatives next 6th month. I anticipate
much pleasure from thy visit to the Dudleys
Dost think can Cobbett's daughters bake bread
[unclear][/unclear] or is it the want of these essential qualifications
keeps them unmarried. I write
with difficulty owing to a [unclear]bilious[/unclear] pain
under my right shoulder blade. Tell me
truly did our packet by E Maguire cost
you any thing, as if it did not we [unclear]might[/unclear]
again use that kind friend. Indeed my
dear it grieves us to put you to postages
but what can we do? We are too poor
to post-pay, & no members can be caught.
I most earnestly request thou wilt not
at my poverty prevent thy soon writing
to me, & as earnestly that thou wilt
direct the letter to my dear mother or
myself, & if there be part to another it
shall be most faithfully delivered [underline]unread[/underline].
Farewell in dearest love to all. [unclear][/unclear] EL

My dear Betsy. When I finished thy letter I looked for more-
"The angel indeed, but in Adam's ear so charming left his voice, that he
"a while thought him still speaking, still stood fixed to hear" How pleasing
that this intercourse can be preserved in spite of distance! I have made a
proposal to Debh. which I wish may be approved of. Oh this little treasure!
I hope she may repay the cares she has caused. I leave to our dear Hannah
to tell thee of her mother & sister, if she writes in this sheet. I have not seen
either yet, not having gone out for some days, not since the 15th. That day
in which were consigned to the earth the remains of one of the kindest of
sisters, the most affectionate of friends. I do not wish to get from under the
pressure which her loss lays on my heart. In such feelings I believe are salutary,
& I forbear looking back to the pleasant days past with her, because
I think we should not aggravate our pain- but many, many will be the
recollections starting up while memory remains. Thou wishes to know
more particularly about the closing scene. Before we went to Carlow Qrly Meeting
sister C. was evidently worse, so as to alarm Mary Doyle who went to the meeting.
Eliz: wrote to D: Johnson. We returned 3rd day 30th 12th mo: found the dear creature
better & cheerful, but she said she had thought of sending to prevent Sally from
staying in Carlow. Next day Debby Johnson came, which revived her. She had a
little before this told me of the horrors which came over her in the night, which
I told her I know something of, & believed it to be nervous (but the [unclear]Dr.[/unclear] said it was
from weakness) She said a dread of death accompanied, & she had endeavoured
to repeat Aikin's address to the deity to dispel this gloom. I begged of her to have
a lighted candle in her room, which she had, & that feeling left her. She

used to say afterwards, "I did not get much rest but I had not the [underline]horrors[/underline]."
which she dreaded more than any bodily suffering. From thence [insertion]forward[/insertion] she seemed
quite comfortable & sweet in her mind, & a few days before her death said to some one,
I forget to whom, that she thought she had been going to die, but was not afraid.
Some time ago she told me that she wanted much purification. It gave her
sincere pleasure to hear that Debby Johnson had gone to visit [unclear][/unclear] John's widow,
& she spoke of feeling her own warmth of temper subdued- Debby left her the
7th [unclear][/unclear]: in fine spirits, her mother having had an uncommon good night. John
had also been to visit her. Well, that was a pleasant morning- but the day brought
gloom, & in the evening the Dr. desired me to inform her children that a change for
the worse had taken place. I did so- next evening her cough returned, she got up a great
deal of phlegm, & was much better, & when Jane came next day she found her so. She
still continued to get up daily, except that she lay one day in bed, till the 7th [deletion]when[/deletion]
from which time she kept her bed. First-day the 11th she had a blister applied to
her chest- she spoke little- her eyes for some days seemed wasting- the blister [unclear]ore[/unclear] well, & the
morning of 12th she was a little revived. about noon she began to sink rapidly. About 4 o'clock
Tho. [unclear]Chandlee[/unclear] & Eliza came. Eliza just saw her, & we got her here, but Thomas sate by her
till she ceased to breathe at 1/2 after 5. Jane, Sally White, [insertion]Jane Thomas,[/insertion] Dolly Coghlan, & I suppose
Becky, were present. I hear the remains looked sweet & smiling . Oh I could not look upon
them. That night, in night coaches, Joseph & Mary Humphreys & John Chandlee came
[unclear][/unclear] Mary being a nurse went back with Joseph next day. He returned to the burial,
& went 17th to Dublin with Eliza Chanellee, who went to see her uncle. [unclear]Tho[/unclear] & John [unclear]went[/unclear]
that night in their homes. Jane went to Dublin the 21st after performing the painful
taste of arranging & disposing of the property. They were very affectionate & cordial-
Eliza is a pleasant [unclear]young woman[/unclear]. Sister Sally's absence did indeed seem
ill-timed, yet I dare not condemn it, because I knew for weeks before
she went that she had a [underline]wish[/underline], some would term it a [underline]concern[/underline] to spend
4
5.
a little time in Cork, & way seemed to open for her to proceed from Carlow
to Clonmel & from thence on. I believe a good man's or woman's steps are
directed by a superintending Providence, & that the time for performing
such an act as this, though not appearing to us to be [deletion]the right time[/deletion] [insertion]so[/insertion], may in
reality be the right time. Our precious departed sister was surrounded by
neighbours, friends & relatives all desirous to serve her, & more than all
had her children, Now, from the peculiar frame of Sally's mind, things might
occur which would add disquiet to sorrow, & the variety of company & [unclear][/unclear]
disturb her. To that I would be sorry she would accuse herself, as indeed she
seems inclined to do, or to apprehend others would do of indifference or
selfishness. We know not how soon we shall be laid beside her, & let us endeavour
after peace within & without. Thou hast greatly reconciled me
to Cobbett- a man who is kind at home wins upon one- & if he permits his
daughters to lie a bed occasionally I believe he is kind, & a good master is a
good thing. I wish thou may see John Walker. If so remind him of me who
has a claim on his friendship & thank him for me for his book. I am
particularly curious to see celebrated persons- places remain- but persons pass
away. I like & I like not to hear of periodical publications. I like that there
should be a taste for them, & I like not that there should be a [underline]glut[/underline] in the market.
Alas for the poor young woman who put an end to her life! Alas! In [unclear][/unclear]
whose defense almost staggers one, & whose forgiveness of his enemies causes hope that
he may also be forgiven; & alas! In the bloody law which punishes murder with
murder. And now farewell, my dear Betsy. Jane Chandlee's dear love to
thee, & to you all, though she is gone. Mary Doyle's abounds thou knows. Abby
Wright's remembrance also- her father has reached America. And all our
Thine
