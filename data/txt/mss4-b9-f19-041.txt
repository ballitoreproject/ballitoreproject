11th mo: 1821
My dear Elizth-
Here I am at home
after a very pleasant visit to
Glendruid where my friends
were as kind to me as they
could be, I spent one day
with Anna Fayle at the
Salt box I thought of thee
& my mother there & wonder'd
how you[deletion]ll[/deletion] all fitted Joseph
went to mineralogize with
Francis Carter so I had none
of his company Anna & Charlotte
were very kind & chatty
the housekeeper at Claremont
is also turning friend I dare
say thro' Joseph's means
thy SB
Elizth. Leadbeater

my mother says she refer'd thee
to me for Dublin news but
I was so little there that I have
none except that Mr Milner
is getting an English wife with
Â£2000, RSL came for me to
the glen & spent Halloween
there & the next day took
a ride with Eliza to the
Glen of the Downes, we brought
home Sally Wright with us
Rachel was asking when
she might expect thee on
thy way home but I could
not tell her I wish thou could
spend a little bit with H Bell
I think thou wants a little
cheerfulness after the long
gloom, poor M R how
can she be otherwise than
gloomy I could not but think
what different errands our
visits were on thine to sooth
the poor mourner & mine
for my own amusement
I went to Claremont to see Joseph
& Mary & [unclear][/unclear] Joseph recovering
& Mary &&& Joseph recovering
his illness & fit to attend to
the boys Mary [underline]en famille[/underline]
I suppose I have spelt this
wrong but I cant help it
I met H Orpen at A Fayles
she is quite a plain friend
in appearance, Jane Cadmore
