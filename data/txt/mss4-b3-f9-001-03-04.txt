Ballitore: 14/2 month 1770.
Joseph Jacob,
	Dear friend and cousin,

	Thy letter, though so long unanswered, was exceedingly welcome to me, & brought considerable increase to that nearness of spirit which I wish to subsist between, & among us. Why I have been so long without replying has been occasioned by a variety of engagements abroad & at home, not by a decay of a friendship which I feel growing & strengthening, from a root, that I trust I may without presumption call a root of divine life: and it is my belief that if we & our beloved companions, true help-mates, be favoured to keep our dwelling in the Truth, we shall more & more be confederated together in solemn league & covenant, & in united travail & laborious [sic] service. When I write to thee, I know not how to divide thee from thy wife. My dear friends, be patient, be diligent in spirit: keep as much as possible out of the hurries & flutters which attend the busy, active life, & whatever ye omit ^ye omit, omit^ not to keep up the daily sacrifice. And as ye thus follow on to know the Lord, & wait from season to season to feel his hand upon you, ye will be dipped into a state of tribulations & sympathy with the oppressed cause of our great Head & Master Jesus Christ, & ye will be made partakers of his sufferings. Shrink not, my beloved companions, at these bitter cups & baptisms; if ye deny him not when he is persecuted & reviled, if ye accompany him with fidelity to his place of suffering; yet will in due time be made living & joyful witnesses of his resurrection in life & power. I am troubled in my measure at the situation of things amongst us: there are so few living witnesses of the Truth which they are [pencil page number] 146 educated to profess: there are so many who have indeed been called & visited; but for want of care & diligence on their parts to co-operate with that Power, which would make & keep their hearts as the good ground, the seed of the kingdom is variously rendered fruitless & abortive, & there is not a coming forth in increase of strength, & answering the glorious designs of the great Husbandman. It occurs to me just now as I write (without previous thought) that when I was last in your province, I heard some talk of choosing you, my dear friends, to sit in the select meetings. I know the diffidence & low opinion which ye have respecting yourselves, which might sway you to decline this office, & that you are too generous & sincere to make the reply of Nolo episcopari, in a formal, customary manner. But, take heed, dear friends, how ye resist the call of the Church. Not only the Spirit saith, come; but the Bride saith come; [sic] & the imposition of her hands, when guided by the Spirit, is of great weight & force. Give up in the simplicity of your hearts to what she requires; look not about at others; nor think what others may say: but be willing to become yet more vile, both in your own eyes & theirs [sic]. Humility is the only way to true Honour, & if ever we come to be effectually serviceable in the Lords hand, we must be reduced very low indeed, & self become of little reputation. Many well-disposed persons (I fear) suffer loss, both as to their own states, & capacity for service, by being too backward, not putting their hand to a little business in the family, which is obviously necessary to be done; not caring to make themselves particular, distinguished & exposed to observation; but waiting for some other person more advanced in years, or more conversant in these matters, to do it. But perhaps this is thy own business, not anothers: And why should thou grudge thy little assistance? Thou knowest not what encouragement thy stepping forward in thy rank might be to others, & how acceptable in the sight of the Master by whom actions are weighed. Neither canst thou be certain what detriment may not accrue from this little piece of service being left undone, or improperly done, through thy omission; & from the general weakness suffered by one person falling back out of rank, bringing discouragement upon others, & disorder on the whole.
	These unpremeditated hints I just simply drop, conversing with my dear friends, & having that perfect love, which casts out all fear of offending. I salute you both with true affection: I heartily wish well for you tender offspring. My wife joins me in these sentiments for you & yours.
	Thine sincerely
		Richard Shackleton
