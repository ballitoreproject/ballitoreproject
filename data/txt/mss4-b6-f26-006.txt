The cloud, my friend, still rests I believe on my tabernacle: or at
least I have not been favoured to attain the composure of mind so desirable
wherein to determine anything. I have regretted thy not coming home with
us, which I acknowledge my fault, thinking that some thing might have
occurred tending to dispel the clouds. My dear parents & brother sympathize
with us I believe in our present trial, & wish to do anything wch.
may tend to our relief. My mind, when ready to faint, has sometimes
been favoured with a little stay, & a little thankfulness for it, & then, if I do
not deceive myself, a glimpse of liberty to proceed seems to appear but
clouds gather again, & the state of confusion, chaos-like [insertion]returns[/insertion]. As to being
[unclear]free[/unclear]that thou should make any application to thy mo: meeting
know not what to say, farther than thy own liberty may allow
should that permit, I believe it might go on; but as that time is I suppose
very near, perhaps it might be better to let the matter rest longer
to see whether [deletion]more[/deletion] light may not shine a little on our perplexed path.
We got home well - my cold has opprest me a good deal, but my rest & appetite
do not suffer by it, & I am careful of myself as I can. I should want to know
how thou art as to body & mind, as far as thou art put to communicate
Farewell
