My dear Elizth
Is Richd going to be married, when &
to whom, I pray answer all these questions
I pray answer all there questions
by all means we agree to your plan, indeed
Edw proposed it long ago but surely
nothing of the kind can be done till
all debts are clear'd off. I hope my
proposal will meet with equal
approbation which is that the Executrix
should have the beds & c &c which she
chose to keep, without paying for them
by way of a small remuneration for her
trouble & that she should be excesued giving
up any part of her income to pay the debts
I am glad you were not disappointed in
the produce of the auction, Did Rich'd's men
pay for the timber he got ?

I heard nothing from Lydia since ? I believe
I will write her a few lines by Father F. is
he coming to Dublin ? I mean to send the
long detain'd parcel back to Ballitore
to go from thence to Limerick both my
aunt Gough & [deletion]myself[/deletion] I strove to send
it in vain, How art thou settled thyself
hast thou parted with Anne ? & are all the
work men dismiss'd? does my aunt Sally
[unclear][/unclear] men dismiss'd ? does my Aunt Sally
visit thee? I shall get all news from Deb.
I long to see the dear creature - My nurse
arrived since I wrote the above with the news
of the great fortunes Mr. Leadbeaters daughters
were &c &c all the thousands made by the
Can't - I would be glad to get the
beds by McAvoy, farewell for the present
ever thy L B
the children
are tolerable
