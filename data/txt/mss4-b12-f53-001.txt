A Letter from Benjamin Ferris to Elizabeth Wilkinson,
which shows an instance (with the many we daily see) of the
uncertainty of all human enjoyments, & in some degree instructs,
to seek after that true & solid happiness, which Casteth not only
in time but also will be with the Righteous in never ending
eternity.

My dear Friend
Elizabeth Wilkinson
After a long silence which has not
been easy to me, tho very near trials have been my lot &
chiefly the cause thereof, yet the injunctions of true and
faithfull friendship have been often pressing but notwithstanding
I have not wrote thou has not been less nearly remember'd
by me, with some sympathetic concern on the
account of thy sore confinement, as mentioned in thy two
last acceptable letters to me; which I receiv'd at a time
that I could not well answer them, tho I have much wanted
my sympathizing friend should know how it has been
with me, & now, I have sat down to give thee a little account
tho it may be broken by involuntary interruptions,
In some of mine heretofore I mention'd our being favour'd

favoured with a son, a sweet & lovely babe, who for several
months thrived & seemed to promise length of days; & by many
early indications, a future comfort & satisfaction to us, & it
was often our concern that his endearing, entertaining company
might in no wise rob our attention & love from him that
gave the blessing: Now I seemed to have arrived to great temporal
happiness, I had a dearly beloved & most affectionate wife,
every way helpfull & agreeable to me; a lovely son who for
his age was uncommonly endearing; & plenty of the necessaries,
and many of the conveniences of life; & favoured with a share
of the company of divers good friends & not under any outward
difficulties; My employment in the school & at home requiring
very little connection or concern with the world, so that I
lived a sort of hidden and retired life, which was my choise,
and allowed my much time at home with my dearest second
self, whose society was the most desirable & precious of all
created comforts to me: & O! happy indeed we were together,
being united & made one, not only by the bands of conjugal
affection and covenant, but also in the nearest spiritual
relation; and add to this a near similarity in our natural
dispositions, which I hope I may say were much leavened with

with the meekness, sweetness and tenderness towards each other,
that ought to be preserved at all times, & upon all occasions, &
in this my dearest exceeded, so that many times I have had cause
reverently to acknowledge, and say by good experience, that
the Lord was, & is ever worthy to be solely leaned upon, and
trusted in, to provide & prepare an help meet; beleiving our happy
union was of divine institution, & we each esteemed the other
as [underline]his[/underline] precious gift: and his mercifull dealings with us in this
weighty matter, was often a subject of our thankfull commemoration,
& engaged us humbly to desire to be unitedly devoted to
him, and O! I desire I may never forget, the gracious renewings
of the confirming presence of our heavenly father, witnessed in
our quiet retirements before him, in our little family, which
was the crown of our happiness & joy together, for I may truly
say it was more our desire to have his countenance with us
in our joined state, than to have wealth, or temporal conveniences,
or pleasure; I was happy indeed in my family, Ah! too happy
to continue long tho I humbly hope (& have not in any [unclear]sifting[/unclear]
reason seen it otherwise than) that we enjoyed each other, & the
good things we were favoured with in the fear of The Lord;
But he in his infinite wisdom, saw meet to change this happy scene

scene - Ah the inconstancy of human prospects, and earthly
enjoyments! How soon are they hid & buried under the gloomy
vail of mortality - How fleeting are the happiest scenes of
life: & how without foundation are all its joys, & nothing here
to be depended on, but disappointment & uncertainty - Ah!
how weak is the tie of the most endearing & comfortable connections
in this world, how soon dissolved, & [deletion]in[/deletion] the most
sweet society, and affectionate entertainment, exchanged for
a mournfull solitude, where all creation has lost its power
of pleasing - We had lived together not quite two years,
in the happy manner a little hinted of, when it pleased the
Lord to remove from us our dear little son, being about 13
months old, which with the loss of his most innocent entertaining company
was a very near [deletion]& close[/deletion] tryal to us; yet we could, and did with
one formerly say: the Lord gave, & he taketh away blessed be
his name, and our tryal in the loss of him seemed much
mitigated by our mutual, sympathetic participation, & was in
a great measure made up in an increasing entireness of
reciprocal love & happiness in each other beyond my de-
