Dungannon the 7th of 3d Month: 1762
My Friend, Thy Letter not due I Receivd, & in answer to the Occational part, I dont Know of any likly Prospect of a Settlement in my Acquaintance hereaway for the you^ng^ Man Thou Mentions, there being very few in the Linnen Business that Keeps Clarks meerly for that Purpose, most doing their Business themselves or with the help of their Apprentices or assistants in the other Parts of their trade; if any likly place offer I Intend to advise Thee
	a Person of a generous disposition & honnest Intention, dont Always think it pleasing to be reminded of favours Conferd on Them, & if their Present debility be such as not to be capable to repay, its still more Trying, and whether it bespakes more Prudence in Such, to lend a deaf Ear? or (through a Mixture of Pride & honnour) to attemp paying more than present a bility will admitt of? Let the Learned determine.
	its not a deficult matter for a man of Tolerable Credit, not only to borrow, but allso to pay, but Except he has in Reality so Much as the demand Made, in his Actual Posesson, or deposited in some safe hand, the deficancy Must be borrowd a fresh, and when done, Peradventure it out Avail in inlarging the Dwellings of the Sons of the Prophets; I in Shure it out, unless the Prophet accompany, and in that Case he Can as Easely provide without the Anxiety of the borrower, as restore with it, or after it has proved Inefectual.
	I think no Marvel of Poor Ruths being Turnd back again, its what I pritty fully Expected, but to Speak our feeling is not allways Either Lawfull or Expediant, yet thought my Self no Quite Clear without giving her a short hint of it before we Parted after our late half years Meeting, so that I Learnd before I had thy Exhertation thereto: Some Water, or Sets Water before the flock out of the first Pool that Presents after the flock is gathered yea and before they are settled in their respective Ranges, others dar not without first Partaking of the Water themselves which they are Carefull of Receiving until Certain that it Proceeds from the Great Deep, the very Sensation of which, defuses itself as a fire Shut up in the Bones,, [sic] & the Pitcher being redy to Overflow, altho in their own apprehension the Quantity of water is little in Proportion to the Number, and states of the flock, yet inasmuch as it Proceeds from the fountain of Fullness, who Vouches Safe by hidden Streams to Supply, Every Vesssal he has formd, so long as they adhere to ^&^ mind the Word of Certainty; the little will be made Sufficant for Water for the healthy in the flock, and Medison for such of unsound or mamed, as the Great Shepherd at that Season Intends Instromentaly to Visit; I would that all who think themselves healers were indeed themselves Sound, & Skillfull in feeding, & Watering the flock, in Soundness, and With discression. 	as to Thy Query when Thomas Greer will bee seen Crawling again in your Country, and Supposition that the time is nigh? it maybe the Case for any thing I Know; and it may not, for any thing which I at Present see Clearly; I acknowledge I have felt some Sacret Pangs draw Southward, but these were Stronger & lay closer 12 month agoe than now; perhaps I missed the right time, yet rather thinks the delay is on Account of my Unequalness to the Service, being not only young & unskilled ^&^ Considering the depth, & defficulty of the Work of this day, I have Cause Above many or most, frequently to say Who is Sufficant for this Great work, or Equal to the Assigned Labour in the Vineyard, the Aspect of which seems to be Changed, from that of the Garden of the Most High; to that of a Heritage Scattered & Peeled; nor is this the only discouragment, for alass, what situation are any (who feel the Wound of the People) in, but on beholding those most contiguous to their own lotts Sees Themselves as Surrounded with fields of deficult Labour, in which the faithfull, Truly and honnestly so, are a very few; Dear Friend Whilst I am Just Writing and ading one word to another as comes to hand, a secret Wrong desire arises in my heart That Thou may come to this deficult Point Thorough, intire, unreserved, devoted, & dedicated Faithfullness; what Shall I say, or what is the Cause of the few ness of the Sons of Sion? to make mention of the Name of Her King, and Their God, in the Assembelies of the People, its not for want of some Even of the Wise & Mighty being Calld, and The hand hovering over Such filld With the Gifts of the Spirit, Nay, but it arises from the Reluctance or Inatention in the Called, to be so Reduced as to be made fit to Receive them, & by them to be built up in the Most Holy Faith, & those Graces that Truly Edefie, Indeed many for whom Gifts to have been in store, have never Receivd them, for want of [crossed out] faithfullness unto death, and many others who have been faithfull in Part, have only Receivd their Gifts in Part, and not in Perfection; for want of Intire faithfullness to Him who is Equal in all his ways; Shall I add that I frequently fear the Last is Thy state, as I frequently fear its my own; Could we be so attentive as to Retain the Heavenly dew, it would not only Cause the seed to strike Root And the Blade & Ear to Put forth, But would allso Inclose the Garden from the foul of the Air, & foot of the Traveler, that in due Season the Father Allmighty may be Glorified, in and by us, whom he has Calld to be Children of Light, & Heirs of that Promise thats by Faith.
	Farewell Dear Richard Receive This Ruff draft as its Wrote, may our own Particular Experiance, & that of Each other when Imparted, tend to draw towards the sumit of the holy Hill, many have been Calld to it, and we amongst the many, Let forget the Things that are behind and Press Towards it, Altho it is w[covered by mark] feeble Knees and fearfull steps we assend, yet All Sufficant [water damage] Hath Said, I will never Leave nor forsake Thee, may we Ever Confide in & Lean upon Him, for shure I am, He will never fail.
	Remember me Nearly, To Thy Truly Valuable Wife, & Profitable Companion, and any others as Inquires or has freedom & Believe me Thy Friend in the nearest

Thomas Greer
