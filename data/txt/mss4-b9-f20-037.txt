My dear E - I would be greatly obliged to thee
to tell Nancy that I would not wish her to come
home till she has seen her sister Ally if there
is any likelyhood that she will return within
a week or two from Arklow where she is gone
to bathe, I'm afraid Nancy will hurry home
thinking She is wanted & will miss her sister
who I know she was most anxious to see so
that if thou would send to her room thou
would greatly oblige me, I think little Henry
is already growing fat & I hope will thrive
well, Nurse is greatly liked so that all turn'd
out very well Winny at Stradbally and all,
plans were set aside by the very quick arrival
of the poor infant, the only thought that remain'd
was to keep it alive if possible, Mrs Henry recovers
very well, she has her faithful Mary with her who
is as careful & as concern'd as [unclear]could woman[/unclear]
My dear love M Doyle & Abby ever thy S B
