My dear Mamma
I have just time
to say that we are after
arriving here all safe & well,
& had a pleasant voyage
across the Channel, which
we valued the more, as
we had been so long
delayed by very bad

weather in Larne, in
fact it is not like
summer at all, I am just
after receiving Eliza's note
here, which was a great
comfort indeed, as it
told that all was well -
please get some one to
write a line for both to [underline]Gourock[/underline]
& [underline]Largs[/underline] Post Offices
as I am not sure which
of the places we may
call at, & a line to
both will be best -
I suppose there is only
a chance of Eliza being
with you when you get
this, but if she is, give her
my love & thanks for the note
also love to Fanny, Mary G -
& [unclear][/unclear] in haste your much
attached M J B
write at once ---
