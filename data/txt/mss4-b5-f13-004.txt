My Dear Friend
I received thy very kind Letter & the Book which
is particularly valuable to us as it contains specimens of the genius & friendship
of such valuable friends, we were favourd with a short visit on two
of Thomas Wilkinson who I much wished to see but one cannot form
any judgement of a Person scarcely in so short a time, But I thought the
seemed a sensible bright man from the little converse we had, we almost
were sorry to find he had walk,d all the way & he said he bore it well & was
not foot sore, Dear Creature I hope he will be richly rewarded for this laborious
instance of zeal, His long & lonely walk will furnish him with ample opportunity
of profitable medilation which perhaps may someway or other appear in a
future Day to oblige some favorite friend a kindred mind that can soar into
the [insertion]same[/insertion] latitude or verge within the same sphere with himself, which I have not
the least pretention to, but perhaps my value, [insertion] In [/insertion] may be so favourd, How various
are the gifts of our beautiful Father to the workmanship of His Hands
and how beautiful & useful, where all the faculties of the Seal [deletion] is [/deletion] are bent the
right way, all [unclear] conceereted [/unclear] to the Great Author of all good & in humility & simplicity
of heart employd to the benefit & advantage of others Let us my
Dear Friend, tho we may apprehend ourselves [unclear] posess,d [/unclear] but of the single talent
not [underline] bury [/underline] that [underline] one. [/underline] but faithfully occupy till call’d upon to give up the trust,
knowing that its the faithful in the little that will be made ruler over more
not that I apprehend my Dear A to be only intrusted with the one talent

We have, we think been remarkably favourd at the late Solemnity it was generally thought
to be the largest we have had for many Years & tho many of us felt deeply for the removal
of many of our Dear Friends from the Field of Labours especially our truely valued S Grub
get we had to admire the extension of divine regard in continuing those amongst us who at
this time have been eminently clothed for Service, &appeard Beautifully in their different
degrees & their [insertion] different [/insertion] gifts, whereby the place of Dear Sarah was filled up, those I alluded to particularly
were Martha South, & her companion, Allie Sigg, Eliz. Gibson, Ann Kind, Mercy Sansom
Deborah Darby & Patience Chester with Ann Jilladame of Bristol as Clarks & there seasons
the prospect of many rising up here & those one of a family & two of a tribe which is a
consolating considderations in these dreary times; may these amoungst you & us hold on their way
& become as standard bearers that the vacant places of the honourable lately removed may be
filled up

but knowing her diffident thoughts of her self might conceive it so, in
her low striping seasons, But thou hast much to be thankful for, & much
to be engaged in, mayst thou be faithful in all that is required of thee, that
peace, [underline]sweet peace [/underline] may be thy compassion.
I hope & believe thou wilt be favourd with much comfort
and happiness in thy connection with so valuable a friend & it must
be a great additional comfort to thy Dear & worthy parents that art
settled at Ballitore as well as to Dear Abraham & his wife to whom
my Dear love & that I received His, & sent a [unclear][/unclear]
to give him a line by some friend returning very soon, where [unclear][/unclear]
to find my self rather better qualified to write than at this present sitting
but was not willing thy Dear Father should venture without any convincing
thee of any affectionate remembrance of thee, & therefore hope thou wilt
accept the simple efforts of thy affectionate Friend
Elizabeth Bevington
My Husband, Son Sam, Daughters, Mary, Rachel, [deletion] Mary [/deletion], &
Elizabeth desire kind love with mine to thy whole self, parents &
Brother & wife
My Family through Mercy, [insertion] are [/insertion] favourd with Health & I
hope my Dear Friends are partakers of the like Blessing.
We are much obliged by thy kindness in sending the that
Book of choice pieces & am sorry to give thee so much trouble & should rejoice to
to serve thee in any thing.
