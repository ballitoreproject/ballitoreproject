Dear friend
I Regret the magazines
were not sent sooner - Greene
the book binder having left
town abt a week - then [unclear][/unclear]
not answering his business
he has summoned to the Capital
where thou canst have them
done by him on good terms
Thine was the first intimation
I had of James not having seen
thee wch. I believe he regrets wth
thee - he is not present or wd.
I suppose express it himself
we are all as usual hope
thy Sister Sallys [unclear]anxiety[/unclear] will
soon be relieved by a visit from
S: [unclear]Pike[/unclear] who we hear is soon

to come this way - I imagine his
opinion & operation is advisable
will be equal to any she
coud obtain - I met William
in your street & was sorry to
see the premature effects of
age advancing upon him. - I
wd recommend his frequent exercise
on horse back & nearly
total abstinence from all
spirituous & fermented liquors
I have found considerable advantage
to my health by this
mode of living. I take stir-about
almost every morning & a tea
cup of dandilyon juice night
& morning & occasionally [unclear][/unclear]
a [unclear]preparation[/unclear] of [unclear]mercury[/unclear]
in [unclear][/unclear] - if his complaints
are similar to mine viz an --
apportion of the liver - he cannot
employ a better physician
than the aforesd prescriptions
Frank [unclear]Mcgennory[/unclear] can make
up the pills from my recipts
these I take but occasionally
when my bowels are confined
Thy affte friend
