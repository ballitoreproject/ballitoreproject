Blackheath Colerain Decr. 14th
1816
My dear Madam
I received your letter the day before
yesterday & have lost no time in communicating
the contents of it to Lord O'Neill - - -
For the arrangement of the Post Offices through
the kingdom I find that the south falls to Lord
Ross & the north to my friend - In the present instance
I should fondly hope he will interfere in your favour;
& I need not say how much it is my wish - When
I hear from him, you shall be made acquainted
with it - I should be very happy, when it is convenient,
to hear that you, your family & all friends
are well - & if you should favour me with a letter;
put it under cover to Thomas Paul - Genl Post
Office Dublin, & it will come free - - - -

I am much out of the way to hear any literary news
except through the Edinburgh Review which I believe,
has not noticed any of your productions - It is as
[underline]national[/underline] as may be supposed & leans very much
to its friends on the north side of [insertion]the[/insertion] Tweed —
Your Muse, no doubt, still holds a familiar intercourse
with you, & I may venture to say she is
always in good humour —
Believe me,
My Dear Madam,
yours sincerely
John Paul
