Above all labour after that sweet composure; without it, outward
enjoyments, though pleasing, are like pictures of pleasant places
on the walls of a dungeon. Keep as much as thou canst in the quiet
habitation, for it is out of the world; so though its peaceful inhabitant
sees but a little way either backward or forward, yet, as the
mountains are round about Jerusalem, so doth the angel of the
Lord encompass it [deletion]with[/deletion] [insertion]as[/insertion] a guard, & its walls are continually before him.
This is what thy friend is not qualified to say, but which she
sincerely wishes thee to experience, & may thou be the care of
Him who careth for his poor, helpless children!
Farewell.
