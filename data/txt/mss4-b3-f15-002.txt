From Richard Shackleton to Elizabeth Pike

Ballitore 29..9 month 1752
Dear friend
Elizabeth Pike
	Having divers times found my heart attracted with a measure of pure and innocent love towards thee, so that at times prayers in secret have been proceeded from my mouth, & many tears from my eyes on thy behalf, I thought this day that I would take the liberty of addressing ^a few lines to^ thee, though very much a stranger to thee, that if possible through any thing which I might communicate this way, thou might in any little degree be encouraged to step forward. For in a long & lonesome road it is some comfort to a poor traveller to see others on the same way, though they receive no help or assistance from them. But while I attempt to give thee this encouragement, I find myself so beset with a consciousness of my own weakness, emptiness, poverty and exceedingly low degree, that I am ready to reprove myself for my [word crossed out] forwardness, & query how can I be helpful to another who am so entirely destitute of Good myself, & who by a long course of backsliding am as a sapless, tree fruitless branch, & only through infinite mercy, not through my desert, not quite lopped off & cast away. But as during my backsliding I have reason to think that by my unsavoury, unsanctified conduct & conversation (though preserved in more ^in^ bounds than many others) I have been an instrument in the hand of the enemy to ^do hurt to^ some, who, observing the plain appearance, which, by the strictness of my education, I was obliged to make, made my uncircumspect walking a precedent or confirmation to them in theirs, & also to others who justified themselves, & lightly esteemed the way of Truth, in that they who were not looked on so much in unity with friends as I, yet were as cautious in some particulars of their conduct.
[pencil page number] 2 	I say, as this (I know) has been the case while I was in a greater measure subject to the power of the enemy. So, as it has pleased divine Wisdom & justice (when he thought fit) to chastise me with his rod for my out-goings, & like a tender father give me at times some hopes, that if I keep covenant with him which I made in the day of my distress, he will also (when he thinks fit) re-admit me into that favour with him, which I witnessed before this my backslidingI am willing therefore, on the other hand (though only at times in the hope, & never in the full enjoyment of that favour) finding now & then a degree of pure love to this heavenly Father, & goodwill to my little brothers & sisters in the Truth, to do any little thing as I may be enabled for the prosperity of the good cause, & as a child with its fellow, to take thee by the hand, and in true love say, Come Sister, let us take sweet counsel together, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the tabernacle where his honour dwelleth, there will he teach us of his ways, & we will walk in his paths. There is no hurting nor destroying in all this holy mountain, but the wolf & the lamb shall feed together, & the lion shall eat straw like the ox, & dust shall be the serpents meat, the little child shall lead the most savage beasts, & the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrices den.
	Here, as we become divested of our wisdom, our own righteousness & our own wills (for the strong man armed keeps the house with & by the arms & utensils which he puts ^finds^ therein) & laying our mouths as in the dust, that is, being wholly possessed with a sense of our own unworthiness & insufficiency, which is aptly expressed by dust becoming (as is meet) the serpents meat, here we become leavened into the meek & lamb-like nature of a little child. And it is this gentle, inoffensive nature alone which wearies out & composes, & sometimes destroys those opposite spirits which we sometimes meet with, & which are aptly represented by the natures of those animals which the prophet mentions as above.
[pencil note] Begin here X [end note] [pencil page number] 3	Dear friend, my desires are strong for thy welfare, & therefore would I recommend to thee, as some little of my own experience, principally & especially to be diligent in the practice of thisoften to wait on the Lord for the renewing of strength, & this, not only in secret, where no eye sees, but also at other times, in & before thy family. And in whatever manner it may please the Lord to appear, be not thou ashamed of his coming. Remember that a broken heart & a contrite spirit, which are offerings of his own preparing, are such as he never despises: nay, he has said by his prophet, though the Heaven be my throne, & the earth my footstool, yet to this person will I look ^even unto him^ that is poor & of a contrite spirit, & trembleth at my word. And such a practice so far from lessening thy authority, I know by experience, will strengthen it in thy family, & insensibly clothe every branch of it with a true respect & love towards thee, nay more than perhaps they would otherwise bear thee.
	Besides, as heads of our respective families, we have a duty to exercise in them, & how can we seek for strength to exercise this duty, & be said to walk exemplary before them, if we do not, from time to time, wait for a renewal of our spiritual senses & strength, & by our example of waiting on the Lord set before their eyes, shew them that they also should be found following us in the practice of this most necessary, as well as other duties respecting their conduct & appearance
	I know no more I have to say. But thou mayst be assured that however poor my expression, & feeble my endeavours to help thee forward, I have at times truly sincere & warm desires for thy welfare, with which I shall conclude & remain
	thy real friend
		Richard Shackleton
