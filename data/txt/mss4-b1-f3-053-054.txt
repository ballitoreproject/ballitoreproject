123			R. S. to his Son	
						Dublin 2nd of Eleventhmonth 1776
		*** We may expect good cheer in good company, but may be disappointed. It is our great loss as a People, that we so much stand looking one upon another. “Ye men of Jerusalem, why stand ye looking one upon another? Jesus, whom ye seek, is not here”--is not to be met with by looking for him in this manner. “If ye seek him, ye shall find him.”
	We profess and hold forth a spiritual, supernatural principle, as the essential, vital part of religion; enabling us both to live, (be spiritually alive,) to know, and to will and to do, as Christians. The world denies this principle, so stumbles at the threshold. It is hard, perhaps impracticable, by dint of reason, to convince even rational men of things which are above reason--which are supernatural. They must be convinced by supernatural means, even by the effects of that power which they deny: these effects to be seen and felt in the lives, conversation, and word and doctrine, of the professors of truth, who live in, and are guided by the power of it. ***
								R. S.
