Tent Lodge Dec 30th - 1817
Your letter my dear Friend of the 12th of May
only reach'd me last week, & then came from our Post office;
I immediately sent to the principal Member of your Society
to enquire for Elizabeth [unclear]Prim[/unclear], & invite her here; the answer was
that she was at Whitehaven, I should have been glad
of an opportunity of showing affection to a friend of yours. -
I have sad - to [underline]me[/underline] almost heart-breaking tidings to relate -
on the 14th of May, my darling Kitty breathed her last! I had
long been prepared for this distressing event; but the constant
[unclear]ead[/unclear] & expectation of it, so weaken'd my Mind, that I was then
[unclear][/unclear]ss able to bear this heavy affliction. - I parted from her in
[unclear][/unclear] Autumn of last year, fully persuaded of her being in a
[unclear]de[/unclear]cline; she was order'd to a warmer Climate, & reach'd Nice early
Nov?, there she continued till the following month of May,

the value of half

I wish my heart
was as strong, but
it has lost the first
object of its affection,
Having now answer'd
I [unclear]wer'd[/unclear] all your
enquiries I will
only add the
assurance of my
being your very
Sincere Friend

[unclear]she[/unclear] removed to Turin, &arrived on the 12th, on the 14th she died.
The [underline]good[/underline] Catholics of the place refused Interment in their consecrated
Ground, so her Remains were taken to Perignol, & she is
buried in a Protestant Church among the original Waldenses,-
there yet remains a Community of about 20,000 Protestants in that
quarter; You will perhaps dear Friend, marvel at my feeling
sort of satisfaction from her being so Interr'd, but I could not
wish my beloved Daughter's dust mingled with Those who [underline]religiously[/underline]
believed her unfit for Heaven! She leaves 5 Children,
3 Girls & 2 Boys) & a most disconsolate Husband. as to Myself,
I am left poor indeed! You [underline]knew[/underline] her, & will therefore take
an interest in the particulars I have given - I must add
that during her stay at Nice, she received the most kind attentions
from some of the Barclays, & Gurneys, Members of your
Society - I have always found from such, it only required
to [underline]need kindness[/underline], to receive it. I thank you for the observation
respecting dear Elizabeth; every year I receive some personal proof

that her Memory is still held in estimation, & the Public are yet
indulgent to her little Works, for they sell almost as rapidly as
ever- I have suffer'd another discomfort this year, my faithful
Turpin after 40yrs. service, became the Wife of a Neighbouring Farmer,
(not the young Lover, but one of suitable age, & in good circumstances).
it was the loss of a Friend, more than a Servant, she is not however
far distant from me, after she had seen more than 60 yrs., I did flatter
myself that she would not leave me till my Eyes were closed. -
I thank [unclear][/unclear] my Balitore friends for their continued kind [unclear]interest[/unclear]
[unclear]in my welfare[/unclear] pray assure them I am incapable of [unclear]forgetting[/unclear]
the thousand obliging attentions I received from them. When you
write give me a full account of them - I have been reading your
Country-man's poem of [unclear]Lalla Rookh[/unclear], in which there are many beautiful
lines; but I cannot agree with one of my Correspondents, that
"Moore has all the energy without the Wildness of Ld. Byron". - what
can be more [underline]wild[/underline] than "the Nail'd Prophet", or more disgusting than
the subject! yet it has many fine passages. - For Energy, Ld. Byron
is unrival'd in my opinion. Have you seen his "Manfred"? a fragment
play, most horribly fine! In this Country we are half mad with
delight of some Novels, supposed to be written by Walter Scott. there is

one announced in the Press "Rob Roy". I order'd the publisher to [unclear]send[/unclear]
it me so soon as it came out, & he says 10,000 Copies are already
[unclear]order'd[/unclear]; surely Novel writing is the best of all Trades! it is positive
to the Many - & amusement to the Few. We have had a [unclear]more[/unclear]
abundant Harvest, & glorious Weather for reaping it, I shall
Rejoice to hear you have been equally fortunate in Ireland.
Surely every Month will be fill'd with Bread, & we shall cease [unclear][/unclear]
hear the outcry for "Universal Suffrage, & Annual Parliaments
I see by this morning's paper, that 4 of the deluded Rioters are [unclear]found[/unclear]
Guilty of High Treason, & have been sentenced to Death, it is supposed
only three will suffer - upwards of 30 will escape with slight punishment
