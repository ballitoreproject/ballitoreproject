My [deletion]L[/deletion]dear frd,
& Cousin
By a letter my husband recd, from thee confirming what
we heard of the awful undertaking thou has before thee, (which tho' now is
no secret, yet I doubt not has long been so in thy breast) I though it wou'd be
but kind in me, to let thee know that I have felt sympathy with thee on that
acct., as being different from other services, in those days; but the way that thou
had concluded to move in it, appears to me as the counsel of best Wisdom, As for
any observations I can make they seem little worthy as my understanding seems
weakened, & my judgment much taken away, however I may say that thy faithfulness
& devotion of Soul as to this & other services, has at times done me good
& cheered my poor & often afflicted spirit; [deletion]&[/deletion] for what greater comfort can there
be than to see & feel that a succession of testimony bearers [deletion]a[/deletion] to the everlasting
unchang[insertion]e[/insertion]able Truth is raising up amongst those who are in the prime of
life, willing to go forth, under their Lords Banner in their Lord's Armour, not
with carnal weapons, not with the wisdom parts or aquirements that any may
be furnished with as men & creatures [deletion]unless[/deletion] unless they be sanctified, but with the
weapons of his spirit which when humbly depended up[insertion]on[/insertion] are mighty to the pulling
down the strong holds that sin & Satan have built up in the hearts of many.
Till thou mentiond it I had not [insertion]that I remember[/insertion] heard that our worthy frd. GD had a concern
of the same nature as thou [insertion]hast[/insertion] had, but since I heard of thine, I have often thought
that our Dr. & mutual frd. R: Jones might be detained behind her [insertion]dear country folk[/insertion] [deletion]frds.[/deletion], for that
purpose - I hope if she can see her way clear she will not let thee go without her
aiding [insertion]hand[/insertion] to help thee on, & tho it [insertion]may be[/insertion] weak, & the poor knees [deletion]be[/deletion] feeble, her Master whom
she serves is able & willing to strengthen & confirm both. - If it be so order'd that
thy Husband & your Dr. old companion GD go with you it will be I hope a
great comfort, & hard things may be made easy, & bitter things sweet to the
faithful honest laborers, who are concerned to be wise as serpents, harmless
as Doves, - I am with much affection thy true & faithful frd
