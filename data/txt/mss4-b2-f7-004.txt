Dear Cousin
Richard Shackleton

I received thy kind Letter of the 24th of 4 month last and should be very glad, Brother Willy was agreably settled for whom Im satisfied his Father (as well as his relations) are very solicitous; but I dont find Father inclines to fix him in Business, till he meet with a suitable Companions so must submit to the Event; He mentions his Visit to Ireland with great Satisfaction, acknowledging the very kind and obliging Behaviour he received from thee & his uncles family & desird I would remember him affectionately to you.

	Well, Dear Cousin, I suppose by this time thou mayst have retrieved the Loss of a former valuable companion in the enjoyment of an agreable second of whom I was pleasd to hear a good account by G Mason, and very much desire your solid Satisfaction & mutual comfort every way.      I desire thoult remember mine with my wifes (Brother & Sister Websters) Dear Love to Uncle (& aunt, tho unknown to her) for can assure thee, his kind Visit to us, tho short, was very acceptable & if separated, yet the remembrance to several of us, I believe, is very satisfactory & I much desire we may endeavour to follow such worthy Patterns - I wanted not inclination & therefore was sorry I could not conveniently have gone a few Days journey with him.

	Both our families are in usual Health, Sister Todds Child also pretty well & James has lately left him about 500 by an Uncle, he continues unmarried.

	I shall be glad to hear thy poor Sister conducts agreeable to her Father & that shes become worthy his kind Regard and notice, & that they are in a likely way to get a suitable livelihood.

	And now, Dear Richard; tho Ive not much to write thee worth thy acceptance I hope thoult esteem this little as a Token of Love and let me hear from thee, (when & as often as thou thinks convenient) being with my own Wifes (Brothers & Sisters) Dear Love,
Thy Affectionate Kinsman
