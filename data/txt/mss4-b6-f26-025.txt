My dear Molly, Clonmel 20 of 10 mo: 1790.
I may just say, as Abraham
is going homewards, that I continue
to be well. I am this morning to go out
to Samls. mill, & I intend making close
application in order that I may be able to
return soon - I wrote to my Sister Mary
& in answer she says she is quite rejoiced
to hear of our intended union - I did not
begin to write this time enough as Abraham
is just going, however I have not 
much to say. Ah let me hear from
thee soon! I was a good deal disappointed
when I found a frank came from 
Ballitore & not one word from thee
I had written to thee of some sort or 
other; I suppose by this thou hast
got it - farewell my dear Mary &
be sure take good care of thyself if not
for thy own, do for my sake -
Wm. Leadbeater

The delay of the post at Castledermot
is very unpleasant, but sure I could
hear from thee oftener - Abraham
will tell how Peggy is & about the
Meeting, &c. it was a dull time to
me almost all the sittings, I believe
because I was not properly concerned
& exercised - do write as often as thou
can -

Mary Shackleton
Ballitore.
