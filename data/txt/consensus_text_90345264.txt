1st Seventh day. Oh this is delightful
weather so sunny and bright, dry and
warm. The hedges are now such a
lovely green, and the Elder trees quite
in their Spring garb. I think it is
one of the first. Ellen took a
ride to day with Charlie to Ballyman.
Papa went to town this morning.
Margt has returned from her trip
She spent a day or two at Ballitore, as
she wished to see Betsy Barrington once more
she being now very feeble indeed.
They say a comet is now visible, but
I saw no sign of it. An April fool perhaps.
2nd Went to meeting with Ellen and
Philip. E went on into town.
It was pleasant to see Florence's lively
face at meeting. Thos Chandlee
returned with us. Called at Glendruid
and found Grandmama down in
the drawing room and looking pretty
