My dearest Mama

surprised to see that we are here

a letter in London saying that George
Crawford was worse so we came home
at once Dr H. & Catherine came with
us, they are gone to Ballievey also Uncle
Thomas, not Aunt Eliza, as Ballievey

house is full. the day I wrote last from
Amsterdam we left it that evening and
went to the Hague slept there one
night and saw the Museum then
to Rotterdam where we staid two
nights and on Monday last we left
it for Antwerp in a packet we
left that on Wednesday morning
20 minutes past 6 for Ostend
where we arrived in time of
the packet, [deletion]and[/deletion] which arrived at
Ramsgate at 1/2 past 5 after a
very rough sail, all were very sick
except myself I was very near it
but was not quite, we slept at
Ramsgate that night it is a gay
Town, I bought this sheet of paper
there to write on it to thee, it has
a view of the pier and the Hotel
that we lodged in, we left it
yesterday morning at 1/2 past 9
and arrived in London at 2
when we arrived at Culverwells
we found letters there that hastened
us home I also got thine which I
was glad to get we came home
by [insertion]the[/insertion] express train by Holy head
and arrived here at half past 5
Aunt Eliza is gone to town to see
Uncle Thomas off, I told her to leave
word in Britain St that if Papa
is in town to come out here for me
When will he be up, I am ready
to go home with him. I think the
sooner I leave this the better.
Grandmama I understand from

Aunt Martha, was & is uneasy at my
being so long from Miss Browne
but Aunt Martha told her that I wd
learn more by travelling, and so I
did, I feel like a different person
Please write by return of post
and let me know when Papa
will be up. Give my love to
all in haste for post Aunt
Martha sends her dear love and
told me to say that she Uncle Arthur
and Uncle Manliff are going off
to-morrow in the yatch to the Clyde
if the wind is favourable. She
also says that her sister Mary Rigby's
Johnny very ill that the Doctors give
him over, they are afraid it is decline
Now do not forget to write to thy
affectionate Daughter
