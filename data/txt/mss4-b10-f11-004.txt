Glendruid July 1823
My dear John
I suppose you thought
I did not intend to write to you
any more. Why did not you send me
out the [deletion]first[/deletion] [insertion]2nd[/insertion] volume of Anacharsis
travels, I like the first very well
there is a great mixture of different
characters in it; of all the
characters in it I like that
of Socrates and Aristides, best

I was reading some of Elizabeth
Smith the other day, where she says
that she found it a very good way
to write [insertion]down[/insertion] ones thoughts as they occured
for when an idea strikes one, turning
to some[deletion]one[/deletion][insertion]thing[/insertion] else it is forgot. I
think this would be a very good
 way, for I often think [insertion]of things[/insertion] myself
that I would like to remember
that I forget when I want to
write them down. I wish you would
tell me what book to read; I dont
care whither it is prose or poetry.
Sometimes when I am writing
a letter when I have finished it
I dont like to read it over for
fear I should think there was
someth[insertion]i[/insertion]ng in it that the person
would not like or think queer
I hope you will write me a
long letter soon. will you
send me out a few sheets
of letter paper for myself
I remain your affectionate
Sister Emily
