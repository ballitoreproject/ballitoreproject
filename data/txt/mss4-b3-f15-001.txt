Ballitore: 29...9 month 1752


Dear friend,
Elizabeth Pike
	Having divers times found my heart attracted with a measure of pure & innocent love towards thee so that at times prayers in secret have proceeded from my mouth & many tears from my eyes on thy behalf, I thought this day that I would take the liberty of addressing a few lines to thee, though very much a stranger to thee, that if possible that ^through^ any thing which I might communicate this way thou might in any little degree be encouraged to step forward. For in a long & lonesome road it is some comfort to a poor traveller to see others in the same way though they receive no help or assistance from them. But while I attempt to give thee this encouragement, I find myself so beset with a consciousness of my own weakness, emptiness & poverty, & exceedingly low degree, that I am ready to reprove myself for my forwardness, & query how can I be helpful to another who am so entirely destitute of Good myself, & who by a long course of backsliding, am as a sapless, fruitless branch, & only through infinite mercy, not through my desert, not quite lopped off & cast away. But as during my backsliding I have reason to think that by my unsavoury, unsanctified conduct & conversation (though preserved within more in bounds than many others) I have been an instrument in the hand of the enemy to do hurt to some, who, observing the plain appearance which by the strictness of my education I was obliged to make, made my uncircumspect walking, a precedent or confirmation to them in theirs, & also to others who justified themselves & lightly esteemed the way of Truth, in that they who were not looked on so much in unity with Friends as I, yet were as cautious in some particulars of their conduct.
	I say as this I know has been the case while I was in a greater measure subject to the power of the Enemy. So, as it has pleased Divine Wisdom & justice (when he thought fit) to chastise me with his rod for my out-goings, & like a tender father give me at times some hopes that if I keep covenant with Him, which I made in the day of my distress, He will also (when He thinks fit [sic no close paren] re-admit one into that favour with Him which I witnessed before this my backslidingI am willing therefore on the other hand (though only at times in the hope, & never in the full enjoyment of that favour finding now & then a degree of pure love to this heavenly Father, & Good-will to my little brothers & sisters in the Truth [sic no close paren] to do any little thing as I may be enabled for the prosperity of the good cause, & as a child with its fellow, to take thee by the hand, & in true love say Come Sister, let us take sweet counsel together; Let us go up to the mountain of the Lord to the tabernacle where his honour dwelleth there will he teach us of his ways, & we will walk in his paths. There is no hurting nor destroying in all this holy mountain, but the Wolf & the Lamb shall feed together, & the Lion shall eat straw like the Ox, & dust shall be the serpents meat, the little child shall lead the most savage beasts, & the weaned child put his hand on the cockatrice-den.
	Here as we become divested of our wisdom, our own righteousness & our own wills (for the strong man armed keeps the house with & by the arms & utinsils [sic] which he finds therein) & laying our mouths as in the dust that is, being wholly possessed with a sense of our own unworthiness & insufficiency, which is aptly exprest by dust becoming (as is meet) the serpents meat: here we become leavened into the meek & lamb-like nature of a little child. And it is this gentle, inoffensive nature alone, which wearies not & composes, & sometimes destroys those opposite spirits which we sometimes meet with, & which are aptly represented by the natures of those animals which the prophet mentions as above.
	Dear friend, my desires are strong for thy welfare, & therefore I would recommend to thee as some little of my experience, principally & especially to be diligent in the practice of thisOften to wait on the Lord for the renewing of strength, & this not only in secret, where no eye sees, but also at other times, in & before thy family: And in whatever manner it may please the Lord to appear, be not thou ashamed of his coming. Remember that a broken heart & a contrite spirit, which are offerings of his own preparing are such as he never despises: Nay, he has said by his prophet, Though the Heaven be my throne & the earth my footstool, yet to this person will I look that is poor, & of a contrite spirit, & trembleth at my word. And such a practice, so far from lessening thy authority I know by experience will strengthen it in thy family, & insensibly clothe every branch of it with a true respect & love towards thee, nay more than perhaps they would otherwise bear thee.
	Besides, as heads of our respective families, we have a duty to exercise in them, & how can we seek for strength to exercise this duty & be said to walk exemplary before them, if we do not from time to time wait for a renewal of our spiritual sense & strength, & by our example of waiting on the Lord set before their eyes, shew them that they also should be found following us in the practice of this most necessary as well another as other duties, respecting their conduct & appearance
	I know no more I have to say, but thou may be assured that however poor my experience expression & feeble my endeavours to help thee forward, I have at times truly sincere & warm desires for thy welfare with which I shall conclude & remain
	thy real friend
