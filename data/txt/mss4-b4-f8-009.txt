Dear Cousins Abram & Margaret Sha[insertion]c[/insertion]kleton,
I had the pleasure & satisfaction of seeing
Dear cousin Richard here lately, whom (to
use the beloved Apostle's Phrase) I found walking
in the Truth. What greater joy can accrue
to religious Parents in their declining years,
than to see their children born again and
growing up in the Line & seed of Life, likely
and in a hopeful way to be H[deletion]o[/deletion][insertion]e[/insertion]irs & Joint-h[deletion]o[/deletion][insertion]e[/insertion]irs
with Christ in his endless Kingdom of glory,
whether we have less or more to leave them of
this world's fading Riches? I pray that this
may be the happy state of your children
& mine, & the offspring of Friends in general.
May the Blessing of the Lord, which maketh
truly rich, attend us & our's, sanctify unto
us all occurr[deletion]a[/deletion][insertion]e[/insertion]nces, which he in his divine
Providence may see meet to prove us with
& by, & thro' his holy spirit sanctify us unto
himself, thro' Jesus Christ our Lord.
Persons in all stations of Life meet with
some

some ungrateful Occurr[deletion][/deletion][insertion]e[/insertion]nces, but that sweetned
the bitter waters of Marah, can & will make
hard things easy in due time to his faithful
depending People. I have often thought of that
profound Lesson that Habakuk learn'd so perfectly.
Hab 3, 17, 18, "Altho' the Fig-tree shall not
blossom, neither shall fruit be in the vines, the
"blossom, neither shall fruit be in the vines, the
"labour of the olive shall fail, & [insertion]the[/insertion] fields shall
"yield no meat, the flock shall be cut off from
"the fold, and There shall be no herd in the stalls
"yet I will rejoice in the Lord, I will joy [deletion]in the[/deletion]
"in the God of my salvation." [deletion] of my salvation.[/deletion]
May the Lord, who hath been our morning-Light,
be unto us our Evening-song, preserve
us faithful[deletion]ly[/deletion] unto the end of our Days; so wisheth,
so prayeth your cordial and ever Affectionate
Cousin in [deletion]hast[/deletion][insertion] haste. [/insertion]
Cousin Mary Barnard's visit was very
acceptable to us.
I Travel not much abroad, but am in [insertion]a[/insertion] tolerable
state of Health in the whole, being
well content with my condition, and thankful
David Hall.

for

for the unmerited favours many ways conferred
upon poor me: & tho' the Province of a Schoolmaster
be attended with various probations,
yet I have to say (not boastingly, but
humbly) my little School is to me, rather as
a Palace than a Prison. My Dear Love to Cousin
Richard and Spouse.
