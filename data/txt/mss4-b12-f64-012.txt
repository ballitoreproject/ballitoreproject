In returning from the last Meeting I was at (at Penkith)
My Mind was deeply impressed with the Words of the Prophet,
"Smite the Shepherd and the Sheep shall be scattered"
Tho' at that Time the Meaning did not appear so obvious,
it hath since gathered Strength upon my Mind; and a
Desire hath rested with me to leave a few Remarks to
this Monthly and Particular meeting.
"Awake, O Sword! against my Shepherd, and against
the Man that is my Fellow: smite the Shepherd, and the
Sheep shall be scattered." Tho' I am not the Shepherd
to whom the Sword is threatened, yet I have been the
Sub-shepherd, delegated to you by the great Shepherd; and
have labored amongst you according to the Ability
received, in Poverty, in Nakedness, in Strippedness, in Weakness,
as having Nothing yet possessing all Things: my
Mind hath been ever covered with Love towards you, both
in my public Ministry and in private. When I have
been engaged to deal closely and plainly with you, I
have never used any unnecessary severity - But I have
called, and no Man regarded, therefore you shall call
and I will not hear; for I will smite the Shepherd, &
the Sheep shall be scattered. They have perverted the
Mercies

Mercies bestowed; therefore I will take from them the Delight
of their Eyes, and the Desire of their Hearts, and remove
my delegated Shepherd by the Arrow of Death; and the
Sheep shall be smitten.
But in the Extending of my Prospect, an encourageing
Hope has rested on my Mind towards the little ones;
those who are little in their own Eyes, "I will turn mine
Hand upon the little ones, and I will bring them as
thro' the Fire, and refine them as Silver; I will gather them
as Lambs by mine own Power: they shall call on my
Name, and I will hear them: they shall know a Place of
feeding, when the Sheep may be scattered and the Shepherd
removed. My Spirit feels an Evidence that I have laboured
amongst you with Acceptance, that since I have
been mercifully called to a Part in the Ministry, I have
not neglected to warn you, and that when the Shepherd
appears, I also shall appear with Him in Glory.
