From Richard Shackleton to Joseph Jacob

Ballitore: 10th of 9th month 1774

Dear Cousin,

	++++ We called at Peter Doyles, an ancient friend near Carlow, who labours under a cancer in his hand. The compassionate Father did not forget to be gracious to his aged children (the heads of the family) but opened a spring of consolation to the reviving & strengthening the afflicting^ed^ & distressed, I thought what people were like unto us, so visited & favoured, & to whom such succour & supply was administered in the time of greatest need. ++++
	We were concerned at receiving so poor account of thy dear wife, but thy last affords a more pleasing prospect, which I hope thou wilt have to continue to us. I think Divine Providence is remarkably kind to you both in ^the^ removing from you, & preserving to you your children. Those whom He has removed from you a state of pain & weakness into a state of rest & happiness are surely well disposed of, & those who remain appear such promising plants, as there is great likelihood (under the blessing of heaven) ye may have to rejoice in. The boys here are (through mercy) well & hearty, diligent at their learning, agreeable in their deportment, & happy I think in good dispositions. +++
	I am, my dear friend,
		sincerely thine
			Richard Shackleton
