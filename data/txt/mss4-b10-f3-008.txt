Glendruid Wednesday 15 October 1828
Dear Eliza or My dear Sister
We feel very lonesome since you
& Selina are gone, whom I suppose is in Ballitore
by this time, for she set out in the nine O'clock
coach. We were asked to Mr. Lunelle's this evening
but did not go. Margaret & Johnny came out on the
car yesterday, and Sarah the nurse & chet were to
be out to day, but Edward rode out to say that
they would not come untill to morrow. I did not
set much potatoes as there were very few seed
but I hope I soon shall have more, as I heard
there [deletion][/deletion] [insertion]are[/insertion] some in Cabinteely. Sam Wright
came here to day to pay us a visit & intends
to sleep here. Manliff went in to see Ducrow
on Saturday last, & after the performance he
& John rode out here & arrived safe about
one O'clock! they brought home [deletion]a[/deletion][insertion]so[/insertion] great [insertion]an[/insertion] account

[deletion]a[/deletion] of the Stag hunt with a real stag & hounds.
[insertion]that[/insertion] Lucy & I are (I believe) going to it, but the best
of it was that the poor stag jumped in upon
the musicians, & created a great uproar in the
house. S Gamble jun was out here on Sunday.
Having told you all the news I had, I will
leave the remainder of the sheet to be filled by
a more honourable personage, & on that account
I beg leave to conclude and Remain
your affectionate
brother A.B.
P.S. My aunt Gough had been out here since Saturday,
Fifth day morning
My dear Sister I thought I would have had
room and time to write in this letter
but I see that it is almost filled without
me, - so must defer writing till another
time which I intend to do soon - we
were a little surprised to see Aunt Jane
this morning, she and Elizabeth came out
to breakfast - I hope thou art enjoying
thyself - art thou better than when thou went
Edward dined with us
yesterday - Sam Wright and I
rode part of the way
home with him in the
evening - Sam is waiting
for this letter, so I must
conclude with dear love
I remain thy affectionate
Sister Lucy
