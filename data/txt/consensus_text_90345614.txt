the [underline]mild[/underline] weather much - We took
a walk with Miss Hannay and the
children after which I had a delightful
bath, and Mrs Walsh was most
[underline]sevenient[/underline].
This evening who should make
his reappearance at tea time but Mr..
Matterson - Poor fellow! he said his cough
was so bad that he cut his visit to
home, short and came back here
to recruit. Mrs Barter, Miss
Deasy and Mrs Cheyne went to the
ball this evening. Miss Coad
came looking for me just awhile
ago to give me a pocket handkerchief
of Ned's which she got amongst
her clothes - and then we had a
chat and a laugh about various things
Just as we were parting - she said
"Do you know I'd like a piece of
bread and butter" "So would I"
so down we went and after sundry
preliminaries we succeeded in getting
quite a comfortable supper in the little parlour
[underline]and[/underline] were politely waited upon by two
gentlemen -
O. [underline]P[/underline].
