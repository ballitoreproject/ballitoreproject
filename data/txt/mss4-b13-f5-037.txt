19th.. 5 miles to Milton, Thos.. Huntley, brother
& daughter accompanying: sat with the few
there, & returned in the afternoon to Burford,
where meeting was appointed, at six,
into which several of the towns-people
came to whom S:T & Elizth.. Minchin had
much to communicate. 20th.. 6 miles to
Whitney, [insertion]Mathias Padbury guide,[/insertion] sat a painful meeting, & came
7 miles to Charlbury, some wretched road,
guided by John Hankin to dear Sarah
Squire's where we lodg'd. 21st.. First-day:
a labourous day to S:T, after first-meetg..
(wherein she had a considerable deal to say)
& dinner, she had four religious oppertunities
in families, & [underline]then[/underline] concluded
to have the neighbours called together
at half past six O'Clock, - between two
& three hundred, I expect, presently
collected, & I hope there was no cause
to believe [underline]but[/underline] that it was a right concern.
22d.. 6 miles to Chippingnorton to meeting,
