pleasant to see Florence, she & Aunt
E were in town shopping, so Florence
not liking to keep Aunt E waiting
on her, did not pay a very long visit,
Papa went out to Fassaroe after tea
Margt and I went out before
dinner to jaunt in a covered car.
I had a letter from Polly this evening
but did not get it until I had
sent one to her complaining of her
silence - however I wrote to her again
after tea -
28th.. Margt & I went to meeting
it being a fine day, but most
piercing cold - When we returned
peercing cold - When we returned
Ned & Charlie had gone - so Margt
Ned & Charlie had gone - so Magt
and I having first received a visit
from John & Jane - and then settled
everything here at home - set off in
a car for the 1Â½ train for which we
we were just in time - We found
Poor Uncle Richard laid up with
a cold - he however got up soon after
we arrived and Florence & I had a
great chat together so with that & looking
at pictures we spent a very pleasant
day Charlie on his way from
Fassaroe called for us - and we
went in by the 9 O'clock train
He brought me in a letter from
Deborah - Jemmy Perry dined
out there -.
29th A fine day - Papa did not come
in - Margt went out but I did
not - had a note from Lill & have just
answered it.
