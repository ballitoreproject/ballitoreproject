My dear Cousin,
	I am indebted to thy letters of 23rd ultimate & 2nd instant: It is more than we could expect, that thou should devote so much time to us in the midst of thy trouble, only that we well know the sincerity & cordiality of thy friendship for us. We do most heartily sympathize with thee on thy trouble, & make thy case our own. We fear greatly for dear John ++++ What can we do in such a situation, but after using all likely means, & while we are using them, endeavour patiently to submit to that hand, which gave or permitted the blow, that hand which, like the hand of a parent, feeds & corrects? I know these things are easily said  We may hear & see the consolation & assiduous attachment of our friends - but any real, effectual support which we can receive must come by the sense of feeling, & feeling of a supernatural kind, feeling of Divine favour graciously extended to us individually, which, as we happily experience, we shall be brought thereby to acquiesce in the Will of Heaven, believing that all these things are ordered for the best, & resting in the present earnest & quiet assurance of our own salvation. +++ Farewell, my dear beloved cousin, May the best & only true comfort attend thee!
