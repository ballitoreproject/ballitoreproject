My dear Betsy,
"Every heart feels its own bitterness." I was afraid from the stile
thou began thy letter in, that harmony was not restored, but by the
affte way thou speaks of Wm I hope it is, & that thou goes back & forward
as usual. [deletion][/deletion]
[deletion][/deletion]
[deletion][/deletion] Now glad would I be wert thou my representative
at home! but all is for the best I believe. Tell Wm that there was
[unclear][/unclear] a going of tongues about me while I hushed my letter, that I
I wish a going of tongues about me while I finished my letter, that I
forget to say that I saw Paul Simpson attending his shop yesterday,
I think they dear Mother need not mind what was said, or how said
to me - being as I am more prudent than some might think - yes. I
had mentioned Sister Cs' affair to AKnott & S. Hill both kind, good
woman. I wrote to Dawson by George, I believe a note to your mind.
woman. I wrote to EDawson by George, I believe a note to your mind.
Ah my por sister! many a heart ache her situation gives me.
I dined & drank tea with D. Thomas yesterday. Thou wert spoke of at
dinner, & after I the adventure of the hother uncles so related, that I had
to look prim, declare thou could not appear to advantage with thy arm
in a sling & wrapt in a coat, & not being handsome either - "In vain I [unclear]reasoned[/unclear]
I forbade in vain". My boys, as usual, went against me - Poor fellows - it seemed
natural to see them, & like Ballitore, & they convoyed me to James Malone
where I supped. Jane is a sweet young woman. time to go to breakfast

I am seated in a nice back drawing room at Counsellor Colleg, by a fine fire,
& alone, whilst the Lady of the mansion is dressing & her husband at court. I did
not say a word of E Dawson employing Sister G: - E Johnson & I think they would not suit
each other. I have had a good deal of lonely walking to-day, the noise & hurry oppresses
my spirits especially as my own burden is not yet laid down, to-day I hope is
will, so I believe I will not send this till to-morrow. Robt Fayle has informed me of
A Searle's death. I believe on her own account it is not to be regretted, but she was
very dear to her friends. I thought of thee while I looked on the figure of Saint
Andrew & his cross on the round Church, & often I wish for thy cheering converse
& supporting arm or my dear Agnes, while I had my WL I was in no want. Don't
let Aunt Sally think hard of my not writing to her now, her letter was truly acceptable

Edward I suppose to entertain me, his mothers love to thee Sarah Meddlerin
& her house. Poor thing, she mourns sorely her little Letty! I had a long
chat with Nancy Bewley in the latter room to to-day, where we outstaid
every one, she wants a good thorough servant, Debby Thomas wants another
her's having lately married Pat Mc Evoy Nalter of Moone. Canst thou cast
about for such? Tell our Mary, Pat is very well, & well liked, I see him
often & I believe he is glad to see me. O dear Betsy, how glad I am that
Ballitore, & not Dublin is my home! I can yet be no time for my return
it depends[insertion] a good deal[/insertion] on Sam Doyle who seems inclined to accompany me. Our writing
[unclear][/unclear], unemployed, unsolicited, except by the encouragement of his wife & daughter,
has excited his [unclear]latents[/unclear] in the cause of humanity to save the life of Gannon; whether
he will succeed is not yet known - his wife says his life is spent in acts of
kindness

4th Cousin Betsy is not content I should write in the cold room, so I am
seated in the parlour where I know I cannot get on so well. Last evening I communed
with the Printer, & learned his terms, this morning I saw Dr.. Bell, & Counsellor
Colles, the latter had not then drawn out the [unclear]copy[/unclear] of the proposals to be printed
but intended this evening, he excused himself on account of what needed no apology
his exertions to save poor Gannon. This boy Pat who saw me home, told me he had he saved
several lives, amongst the rest a [underline]Priest![/underline] Tell my dear Wm that I think I do not lose
a minute, which I can help, from the business in question; but those professional
men cannot make their time mine, & yet they seem friendly solicitous to expedite
me, & indeed more so than I could expect - but they seem greatly interested in this
concern of mine & I set my face to get thro', to keep up my heart, & look to the recompence
of reward, whatever that may be, & talk of subscriptions as calmly as Mrs
Douglas did of her plain work. The vol is to be a large Octave, & I suppose will be
G..G — this is thought a moderate price & will leave a decent profit.
It is no matter what my feelings are, or what they will be when
the proposals are handed about. I have been obliged to give names to collect
them in different places, & I must write to these persons. Jane & I accompanied
Debby Thomas this morning to breakfast at her sister Hardings near Ranelagh
where she has a comfortable house, excellent garden & 2 acres of land. It was a
mighty pleasant excursions & cheered my spirits, & I hastened home to get a letter, but
there was none — as "no news is good news." Robt Tayler has gone to the country, he
charged me with an affte message to thy Aunt Sally whose letter was very grateful
to him, & no want of love prevented his answering it. We found Dennis had not
gone as we expected & sent the directions, & I hope he got the things as he said he would. Thy
Fathers beam & scales Thos Johnson bought & had sent to T: Gibbons. I paid him.
It stands me upon to do this for the expense of printing is more than we had an
idea of, above £100 if but 1000 are printed, if another £1000 the expence will be less &
the profit more

to Saml Doyle's. My dear love to M. A & S:D:
