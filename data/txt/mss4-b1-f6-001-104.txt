I have sustained by the stupidity, carelessness, or
villany of himself & his drives, and also to let
him know if he does not make me a proper satisfaction,
& such as I trust will be thought [insertion]moderate[/insertion] by
indifferent people, I shall try what the law
will do for me, & shou'd I fail there I'll advertise
him & his slovenly conduct to the world
in as aggravating a manner as the case admits
[unclear][/unclear] you with this: as probably your father
& brother are still attending the meetings, and
knowing you will interest yr.self in a business
I am so materially concern'd in; Mrs. Eyre sends
her best regards to yr. mother & self - she says
she shou'd die in this country that the grave yard
is the place of all others she wou'd like to be buried in:
Adieu and believe
me very sincerely yr. friend
Thos. Eyre
