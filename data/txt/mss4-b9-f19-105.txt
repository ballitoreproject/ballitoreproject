that thou shouldst have been uneasy

and is very busy just now sweeping
the sofa with a little brush Mag tearing
paper with all her might I ask'd her
what I should say to thee for her & she bid
me write Maggie Barrington & Lyddy White
she remembers Ballitore very well she told
me that aunt Elizabeth gave her a halfpenny
& Abby Wright gave her raisins for it - I was
sorry to hear that Marg Doyle had been poorly
after her return home I hope she is well again

was married to an Attorney a very nice young
him to Thos steet he arrived at home about 6 o'clock
in the evening having been away 6 hours My uncle
as thou may suppose was in great anxiety looking
every where he could think of for him all the evening
the poor child was unable to say more than that
he had been [unclear]stript[/unclear] till he was an hour at
home, this circumstance has made my mother
extremely uneasy about her poor little boys
who have to be out a good deal by themselves

the house in summer but leave them in winter

present & pronounces himself quite well
this is joyful tidings for my aunt & the girls is
Betsy gone to Limerick yet if not I wish thou w'd
come to Dublin & pay a little visit & perhaps Mary
would stay with my father & mother during thy
absence if it were only for a few days to see
thy friends, it would be very pleasant

a letter to thee which letter I cannot at present
find but I believe it is quite safe - please

at Lylemore Alley by two men something put into his
mouth his hands fasten'd behind him with a strap

fields where he was stripp'd of all his clothes, but
one man being of "milder mood" gave him back his
