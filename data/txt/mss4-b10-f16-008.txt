Dublin Tuesday 28th Augt. 1821
Dear Eliza
We arrived here safe yesterday
after a slight wetting, it was raining continually until we
got to Dublin where we arrived about 4 OClock. I never saw
the streets so dirty, where his most gracious Majesty was
to go, being about 2 inches thick with mud.
When we reached Brit St we found we had got home before
Edward, who did not arrive 'till after we had dined
We spent the evening after tea in taking profiles and reducing
them to a small size by the Pentagraph we were highly
amused at some of the failures Frederick's my mother & father
and Manliff's were among the best, There were several attempts
made of the others which were not so well done, [deletion]Lydia's[/deletion] we
could not succeed, in any [insertion]of Lydia'[/insertion] that were much like her.
Tell Richd. Leadbeater that the seats he procured us, though
I spoke against them, were the best for keeping off the rain, [deletion]but[/deletion]
we were greatly annoyed by a drunken fellow who was on
the same seat with us, he having let another person get up
at Kilcullen, who gave us a fine Squeesing before we got to town.
30th I received your parcel yesterday containing the letter
and the book, for which I thank you. My Mother and the
Girls went [deletion]yesterday[/deletion] on Tuesday to see the procession to Patricks
Church, the day was so unfavourable, that after waiting the whole

Morning they only saw the Carriages, the[deletion]y[/deletion] people inside
not being visible through the Glass. I hear his going to the
Curragh is put off, they did not hear it in time at Ballitore
to prevent the[deletion]y[/deletion] people from being disappointed, who were going
there, without the wet prevented them from proceeding.
My visit to Ballitore, has occupied more of my thoughts
since I came home, than any thing else, but I hope not to the
detriment of my daily duty. I will never forget the sensations
I felt on approaching it on Sunday last, my heart was
absolutely throbbing with [insertion]the[/insertion] expectation of seeing the place and
people I heard so much about, and I am able to tell you
that from what I saw, I was not disappointed.
I thank you for those lines of Byron's which were almost new to
me, I am not sure that I read them before, but I think I did.
I was trying to write out the other day, all the advantages to be
derived from [deletion]having[/deletion] the proper employment of our time, I conclude
the advantages are so many that [deletion]they[/deletion] it makes the
sum total of happiness, to be able to reflect back on a well spent
life without any regret for misemployed time; but the difficulty
is to act, we are all ready enough without sentiments of
morality, we are satisfied with feeling what is right but we do
not do it. Feeling that I do not always what is right I am
almost tempted whenever I do be preaching morality, to tear

it all up and hold my tongue or pen whichever I am using
It often struck me that the quantities of books that were [insertion]and are[/insertion] written
for the instruction of children in what they should do, and act
are ridiculous I have taken it home to myself and am warranted
in saying that I have read, may be, half a dozen stories on one
particular subject, and felt at the time of reading [insertion]them[/insertion] that what
they inculcated was perfectly right, but still when I was to act
according to that feeling, I did not do it, either through forgetfulness
or carelessness; whereas if I read only one story on the subject
it is very likely that I would have remembered it better and
therefore the effect would be more lasting.
Eliza remember me to the Inn Parlour, the lane, the mill [unclear][/unclear]
and field, your Room, the post office, the Garden, the lane by the School
they fields we went through, the tree we sheltered under the road
like ours, the avenue the Rath of [underline]Narramore[/underline] the long avenue
the fox cover the nine tree hill the road by Boake park the
Greise, J. White's parlour and Garden and all its appurtenances,
and, my lodging, to B BB's house and Garden to Moome Castle
the high road and the Lydia to the study field and [unclear]Love Lane[/unclear]
to the Gooseberry's and to all and every thing I saw in it and
last not least Lugnaculliah.
yours John
PS dont forget to remember me to the Coach and Rain..
