Dear Cousin/ Having an Opportunity of writing by B. Hind am not willing to omit it  My last gave thee an Account of the miserable way of Life my Brother had unhappily thrown himself into, my Sister had a Letter from him, lately, from Galway in Ireland where I suppose he yet continues in General Brudenalls Regiment & Lord Colvilles Company - he seems very desirous to be got off & extremely pressing on her to procure his Discharge promises future good Conduct &c -- My sister is advised (contrary to her own kind Inclinations, I know) to defer it till she can hear a satisfactory Account of his sincere repentance & Conduct agreeable thereto confirmed from other hands in consequence of which advice she has wrote to him, & for the present, excused herself from doing it for him, she is a kind & most affectionate Sister but afraid of doing him rather a Prejudice than favour by doing it ^for him^ too soon If any Friend at or near Gallway would be so kind as enquire particularly into my Brothers Conduct & could give her a promising Account of him my Sister wouwouldd with great pleasure procure his Freedom on almost any Terms if in her power, & as he is very unfit for the Service in many respects perhaps it might by applying & going properly about it be the more easily effected on that Account I desire if thou hast heard anything of him & his Behavior should be pleased to inform me how he goes on when thou writes - tho the great Trouble & concern he has, especially by this last rash step, occasioned us is by time become rather easier to bear yet we are unhappy & always in fear of him still, not knowing what must become of him in Case of Sickness & other Hardships he is but too likely to undergo &c -- We are all (thro Mercy) well & should be glad to hear the same Account of your & thy Fathers Family to whom as if named I desire to be affectionately remembered & am with kind Love to Self Spouse & Children & thy Sisters little son, thy very respectful Kinswoman
