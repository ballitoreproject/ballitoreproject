From the same to the same
Ballitore: 14/2 month 1788

I always think myself peculiarly favoured when I receive a few lines from my dear & much respected friend Abiah Darby, & I am ready to upbraid myself when much time passed before I make some sort of reply. I am greatly obliged to thee in thy advanced stage of life & under the pressure of consequent bodily infirmities, for sending me these pledges of thy affectionate remembrance - & I greatly desire as I also advance in years, & may expect accumulated weakness of body & mind, that I may be mercifully preserved so walking blameless, so filling up my relative duties, as that I may happily witness the continuance of the precious unity of my beloved friends. Religious fellowship, the unity of the brethren, is indeed, pleasant & strengthening - but unless we keep the unity of the Spirit, & walk in the Spirit, that spiritual intercourse with one another will die away, having lost that which was its source & supply. Many indeed are the dangers which await us, & great & manifold is the mystery of ungodliness - but the Grace which was sufficient for the great apostle remains to be sufficient for each of us in our several trials, temptations and buffetings - May we feel after its holy influence, submit to its operation, & shew forth the efficacy of it in our lives & conversation, & in all our demeanour - then well shall we be preachers of righteousness indeed, magnifiers of the inward law, & spreaders & promoters of genuine Christianity among men. Such, when a gift for the edification of others, in a more publick line, is super-added, & committed to their trust, have been, are & will be of great service in the great Masters hand. ***

Annexed to thy lines I received a few from my dear friend & cousin Debby Darby. I was glad that she and her dear companion had returned in peace & safety from their expedition - I trust by these faithful excursions they will know an accumulation of sport, & an increase of spiritual substance, so that they will be rich in good works, ready to communicate to the many poor starvelings that are amongst us. ** A few months ago I joined several of my betters (by appointment of our half-years meeting) in a visit to the sundry meetings of discipline in this nation. Through divine condescension help was administered every way, & the visit I believe rendered acceptable, & in some degree profitable. Thus, though we complain of low times & too general a declension, yet when there is a going forth in devotedness & simplicity, there is often experienced a returning with approbation & encouragement to renewed dedication & obedience. *****

Our dear afflicted friend Anna Taverner still continues in this place - is often much indisposed - yet on the whole has born this winter better than usual, & we cherish a hope that it may prove consistent with the divine will yet to restore her to an ordinary share of health & the walks of civil & social life from which she has been a long time secluded. She is still the same sweet-spirited sensible friend, & lively, edifying companion. ***

Farewell, my dear friend - may thy last days be thy best & happiest, & the purest sweets be found by thee at the bottom of the cup of life.

I am, with sincere esteem & regard -

thy truly affectionate friend

Richard Shackleton
