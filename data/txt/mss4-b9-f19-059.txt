5th Mo : 1823
My dear Elizth
John was out fishing when thy packet came
by W Tod! So I did not get my share till after I had
written to thee - Deborah was confined to bed all
day to day by a new medicine which she thinks
was of use in lessening her size, she is not worse
than when my father saw her, they have not
decided when they will go to Holly head [unclear][/unclear]
is so extremely unsettled, Eben had a long letter
from Lydia to day she seems in good spirits
at the prospect of seeing us all next month
Maggie I think thrives notwithstanding the itch
or whatever it may be, she takes great notice of
the paper on the walls & of the sofa cover
tell my mother that Deb: is obliged for the assparagus
Jane Jones paid us a visit to day & saw Mag: Deborah
was not up - . I hope we shall all meet some
time next month, I had a note from Jane [unclear]O'brien[/unclear]

to day saying that she & her family were going to England
& that she had rec.d a note from my mother along with
a parcel of books - no tidings of thy umbrella
as yet Rebecca Webb has taken the first step
shall we say "she put her foot in it" ?
How is my aunt Sally ? the child that Mag was
vaccinated from seem'd to me to be perfectly clean
I send this to M Bonham to take to thee
ever thy affectn sister S B
