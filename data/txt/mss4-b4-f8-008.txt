Blessing of good Health in our family & among Friends in general here away
at prsent, so far as I know. I am much engaged to yr ffountain of all
our Mercies [insertion]for[/insertion] ye additional favour of a virtuosy, managing wife & both
sutable for me & my Children, wch all 3 do well under her care.
Daughter Betty is a very active Girl, has got into Virgil & is a
