To Mrs. Leadbeater
Madam
We have taken the liberty of sending
you an Account of the Religious Book Society and of
requesting a favour which we hope you will be kind enough
to grant us - This Society whose Patron is Mr Alexr. - Ferrier
was formed in the beginning of last Year, its objects are to supply
the poor with Bibles Testaments & Religious Tracts [underline]gratis[/underline] or at a [underline]low[/underline]
[underline]price[/underline] - Since its formation, upwards of twenty thousand Tracts,
besides a considerable number of Bibles & Testaments have been
distributed - the following places have been supplied "Carlow,
Cork, Sligo, Boyle, Kilmore, Ballyhayes, Houth, Leixliss, Lucan,
Naas, Nenagh, Rathfarnham, Wicklow & the Barracks &
other public Institutions in and near Dublin - An Auxiliary
Branch has been formed in Galway where the distribution of
Tracts has been attended with some degree of Success - A
Correspondent from Galway writes "that a Man having
read the "Swearers Prayer" and from being a proverb for
Swearing even to a Shocking degree, has now learned
to "swear not at all" We might quote several [insertion]other[/insertion] instances
wherein the Reading of Tracts have proved useful - but
we presume this will be sufficient to satisfy you of the utility
of an institution of this kind - We have established
Shops in different parts of Ireland for selling Tracts at
a small Commision and are endeavouring if possible to

establish more - We will feel particularly obliged
to you, by your enquiring among the Shopkeepers in
Ballytore, if any of them will be willing to
engage in selling Tracts - Supplies will be
regularly sent - necessary directions given and
every arrangement made that may tend to facilitate
the Sale - When we hear the Result of your
endeavours, if successful (as doubtless they will be)
We will send a more particular Account, how the
Sale must be conducted, Prices of Tracts &c &c &
A Letter directed to either of the Secretaries
to the Depository 52 Grafton St. will be attended
to -
We remain for the Society
Yr. humble Servts.
