I believe my dear friend M.W. knows that every occasion of intercourse with her is grateful to me [blank] know by whom we are beloved. [end pencil insertion] 
I am obliged to thee, my dear friend for the piece of intelligence imparted in thy letter  whatever nearly concerns thee cannot be uninteresting to me. At the same time that I feel for the trouble of thy brother & sister J I rejoice that their child under your roof is happily restored  Good & gracious, & ordered in unsearchable Wisdom are all the Lords dealings with his people, and visited children  they tend uniformly to reduce that part, which through its various modifications is still to be called Self  they tend to annihilate the will of the Creature, so that it can say in truth, Not my will, but thine be done!they tend to subjugate the passions and fleshly inclinations, ^&^ to bring every thought to the obedience of Christ  By this passive obedience & non-resistance to the operation of the Spirit, men & women are formed into vessels for the Great Masters use, whose interiour [sic] parts being made clean and sanctified by the Word, the exteriour [sic] are clean also, & Holiness is visibly inscribed upon them  But for want of a plenary surrender, and total, [page number] 104 unreserved dedication of all, we become as half-baked bread, as cakes not turned  for want of being willing to go deep enough down in humble prostration, we are not raised to that degree of life and power, which we would otherwise experience  My wife & children join in cordial salutes to thee, to dear Cousin Robert, to Anna & thy niece, with
        thy truly affectionate
                Richard Shackleton
