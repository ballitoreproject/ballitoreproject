Bristol the 23 of 9 mo: 1787
I was talking to my Companion some days past of
endeavouring to write a few lines to my dear friend Mary Shackleton
believing I was under a kind of promise so to do on our parting in Dublin
and this morning I laid out for that purpose if providence saw must to
open a little stream & cause it to run from a spring that has long been dried
up insomuch that I could scarce write a word to any of of my friends or relations &
I was ready to conclude it was [insertion] best [/insertion] so was not this the best conclusion to come to, when
I cou'd not help my self for if a door or place be shut up it is better to wait till
is alittle open'd than to break the lock & force open & by that means perhaps
do mischief - thou art not insensible my friend what a poor creature I am and
that nothing I cou'd pen is worth paying postage for- well this day as I was
going to sit down to dinner our landlord John Lury put into my hand two letters
which contained there one from Dear J:J dated the 15 of 7 mo: & one which contained
[unclear]one[/unclear] from Dear A:S & M:S dated the 25 of 8 mo last where could they be as there
[unclear]was[/unclear] no superscription on them but Jane Watson they did not seem to wore
with traveling but oh how did they comfort me I just thought I cou'd adapt Dear
[unclear][/unclear] Peislys words the Lords raises up many friends for me who retains me in
their Remembrance such a worthless creature as I - I think I may say I have not
words to set forth the gratitude I felt for those favours, & can say you have
[unclear]often[/unclear] of late been much in my mind & a little instance of it I believe I may relate
[unclear]being[/unclear] in a shop some time ago I saw a cotten drap colourd handkerchief said I
to my Companion Ile buy that for the mistress it will keek her brave & warm
so I did buy it & hopes to give it or send so that neither distance or place cannot
[unclear]ease[/unclear] out true affection which I hope I have for every branch of the family & the
[unclear]little[/unclear] ones of a later growth, thy Dr Father we have often thought of & talked of
and if a wish or desire wou'd have brought him to long since we wou'd have had him
[unclear]for[/unclear] we meet with none like him in this trying journey but believe he is engaged
in the same cause & able to support it in its own dignity but oh me poor me
what can I do only just mourn along we strove to sit with the few families in
[unclear]Exeter[/unclear] & left that three weaks yesterday came along thro the remainder of that
[unclear]unty[/unclear] and Somersetshire sonier sets fire to attend the Quarterly meeting of this city which was held
last fourthday I hope to some little Edification to the people Quarterly meetings
[unclear]were[/unclear] held but one day in those counties & I believe it is a pretty general thing

thro this land except York - I suppose thy sister sally was gratified with
the Company of Cou. Saml. [unclear]Weale[/unclear] & doubt not but you all partook of the
enjoyment of his agreable company we hear he looks badly & the thirst great
so that it seems as if he was wearing away but if the days work be done
let the awful messenger come when he will the right preparation
will be made & a happy release will be experienced Yet I know he wou'd
be a great loss to the Nation & an exceeding great one to the province where
he dwells but there are a pretty large plantation there ras'd & raising
up as we hear & hear with pleasure may it not be term'd a wetter soil
than some other parts tho there has been the appearance of something
agreable in many places in ours especially among the youths and at
times a beautiful prospect of greeness when the leaf was produced and
there has been something like the spring appearing when an expectat[unclear]ion[/unclear]
was rais'd & a looking for the blossom but whether the leaves grew too [unclear][/unclear]
that prevented the putting forth of the blossom I cant say yet if the [unclear]blossom[/unclear]
did appear somwhat or other blasted them so much that the fruit didnt
ripen so as to be useful sweet & good for use, thou knows my Dr molly
that fruit which is not ripe will not keep to be laid up for use thou also
knows that a little good fruit after dinner brought forth is at times very
pleasant I have partook of it often & liked it better than all I had eaten before
[unclear][/unclear] even at thy fathers table where I partook plentifully [deletion][/deletion] [insertion]when[/insertion] a good woman or
[unclear][/unclear] tho but a poor [unclear]traveler has[/unclear] brought forth out of the kings closet a dish
& ripe fruit that has replenish'd the minds of many present well thought
I this is an excellent desart, it is not like apples or nuts where some may be
pinked some wholly decay'd & some of the nuts blind, this is sound throughout
and defuses something that replenish's the very root of the plant in such
a manner that all partake & are well satisfied - I hope thou wilt excuse my
manner of writing I am sure if I had any better thou shou'd be welcom to [insertion]it[/insertion] but
Still your remembrance of such a apoor creature as I does me a great deal of good
but excuse me when I have looked at one Quarter & another of our province
where the seed has been sown water'd & grow'd for a atime I have thought if it
be the Lord will as I believe it is, that those grow & bring forth ripe fruit
which will be lasting & I shou'd live to be old but preserv'd they may sometimes
be favour'd to feed me & I believe the fruit wou'd be pleasant to my taste
thou knows it is the young ones that is to provide for those that is past

Labour, and what am I good for now they are all at meeting & I sitting in our Chamber
by my self confined with a bad cold, striving to scribble over these few worthless
lines but there is no mony so agreably paid as mony to hear from ones
friends that wou'd not be allow'd from my beloved friends of Ballitore that I
receiv'd their favours with so much pleasure, but I hope if I am favoured with
another it wont be sent about for too or there months to save a few pence oh did
I think that any of the[deletion][/deletion][insertion]m[/insertion] cou'd entertain a thought that I shou'd grudge to pay postage
for letters that I valued so much I believe not only out of kindness thro favour
I am sufficiently supplied with abundantly more than I deserve, oh this heart
of [deletion]of[/deletion] mine I wish it may be grateful enough
Since we came into this land we have been wonderfully favourd with health
till a few days back we went up to avery high hill near this city to dine with
a friend & there I believe I got it & coming out the same evening out of an evening
meeting if I got it on the hill perhaps it was by being exalted above measure
[unclear][/unclear] the very begining of it was the effects of a damp bed which seizd my Dear Companion
with a great hoarsness but by care she soon got better which I looked upon a great
favour as I was a good deal alarmed at first but I believe a little of the effects of it
remain'd in me & an addition encreas'd it but I make no doubt but it is for the best
if I make the right use of those little trials - there was in this city on fifthday
the funeral of Wilcocks Phelps wifes sister Buried in Quaker pomp such &
such men invited but no women to attend, I suppose the corps was carried from the
house a little after ten oClock in the morning I suppose Thos. Butler & the rest of the
great preachers attaned of the man.- my Companion [insertion]is[/insertion] come from meeting seems low she
says she wou'd be glad thy father mother or I Williams wou'd write her a few lines thou
knows [unclear]about[/unclear][unclear]staff[/unclear] helps over stepping stones that seems difficult to get over & it seems
very difficult to get over the many oppositions that are to be met with in this place
thy Father knows that for he had to partake of some of the better cups that are to be
met with here - & tho she is cast down I hope not forsaken may the supporting hand
be mercifully stretched out for her support, is what I much desire, she is gone again
to the Evening meeting six oClock as there is constantly three meetings on a first
day in this place poor me left alone oh that I may be preserved from bringing
any blemish on this truth that I have at times as I thought endeavour'd to support
for it realy is perilous times even times when the little stuff I have for sale
seems to mean as if their wou'd be but few purchasers but if I can get but as
much as will help me along I keep life in me I hope to be content
is it not time to come to a conclusion to stop my pen from runing farther
and say my Dr Companion desir'd to be affectionately rememberd to all the
families & then added tis hard for me to be going to meeting without thee
the Dr Creature I hope she will have better Company than me even the company

of the great master which has wonderfully helped with a little help in the [unclear]med[/unclear]
[unclear][/unclear] time) not stop'd yet thou knows proper will take anything & I think I may [insertion]say[/insertion] this
the longest letter I ever wrote if there be anything in[insertion] it [/insertion]that will be agreeable my
[unclear]d[/unclear]d will be answerd but this much I may say it goes from one who wishes sincerely
[unclear][/unclear] welfare growth & prosperity of all the familys in that which is un[insertion]c[/insertion]ghangably
[unclear]od,[/unclear] tell thy Brother there that his kindness with Dear sallys & thine will not [unclear]soon[/unclear]
forgot by me if I am spared a little longer to war with the toils & of [unclear][/unclear]
human nature & oh that I may be so preserv'd as to be worthy a place in the
[unclear]minds[/unclear] of my Dear friends for sure it is very precious & shall look upon it
singular favour to be favoured again with a few lines Directed to John Lury
[unclear]Bristol[/unclear] as we shall be like to come this way out of Willshire tho at present
[unclear][/unclear]ld at a state of uncertainly which way to stear but the little Glimering of light
excuse all Blunders remembering who it is from
that does appear seems that way & into Gloustershire but hope to wait
very dul to be on the water yet know the [deletion][/deletion][insertion]great[/insertion] power is the same on sea as land
my very Dear love to they mother & sisters & Brothers [unclear]I mean[/unclear]
wife & thy Brother Abraham & his [unclear][/unclear] Hudson Amm Mconoughty they Aunt fuller Dr.
H Tavenner & the young women where she [insertion]is [/insertion] Wilson & sister A Haughton Sam Haughton
all others that may enquire hope thou wilt accept the same from thy sincerely affect.
