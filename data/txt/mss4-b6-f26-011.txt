Irish-town [underline]very near[/underline] Mt. melick
30th. of 8th. mo: 1791.
As I hear the post goes out this day, & that it is quite likely a letter will
reach thee, my best beloved on earth, to-morrow, though I have my doubts about
it I thought I would write hap-hazard, to let thee know I had an agreeable
journey with very little fatigue, I think as little as I have at all felt in such
a length of way: Jemmy Pim was so exceeding kind & attentive [insertion]& the horse easy-gaited[/insertion] as made
it easy to be with him we staid longer at Athy than we intended, from
thence James [underline]would[/underline] bring an Umbrella wch. defended me from two slight showers.
We got to Mt.melick about 3 o'clock: dined at Jonathan Pim's with my
beloved M Bewley, who met me there, & had a pleasant walk hither afterwards,
Wm. Gatchell, E: Smith, & the Provincial girls drank tea here, also Jno Taylor;
they all seemed bravely, & affectionate enquiries were made for thee: W: G: very
sprightly. When I have wrote this, my MB & I purpose going to town to
see my friends, I feel no weariness to-day & am quite well - Since I began
this, Mungo Bewley & his sister Molly came into the room & informed
me to this effect, that however desirous [insertion]I was that[/insertion] I should stay longer, way would
be made for my return as proposed, if it was not rendered impracticable
by this circumstance; that both Mungo's horses were sent for cotton to
Waterford yesterday, & are expected back seventh-day, & as no other they
think can be had, they wish me to be satisfied to stay till second-day:
John Bewley being in Dublin, & not expected back till about that time,
Molly

Molly is not willing to leave her sister, nor she to part her till then. So as this
matter seems as if it could not be ordered otherwise, I will endeavour, I intend, not
to be uneasy, my greatest cause of being so is lest thou should think I [underline]willingly[/underline]
deviated from the plan thou proposed, or was not as anxious to meet
thee again as thou kindly art for my return - however little I can trust
my heart in most things, in respect to thee it does not deceive me, &
the enjoyment of the sweet company here, does not compensate for the loss
of thine, which was secretly felt last evening with a tender regret. Now
couldst thou, as they wish much for it, come hither 6th. day, visit thy farm
on 7th., or perhaps make that thy way, spend 1st. day with thy friends here,
& be with us home next day, if convenient I think it would be an eligible
plan. Our dear friend W Beale wishes us to see thee to settle about the
stockings - Perhaps some other business might be transacted. My dear love
attends father, mother, brother, sisters, the children M Mellor, M:Hudson, &
Nancy Doyle, whom please tell that I forgot to deliver her letter at Athy,
which troubled me, but I hope to do it returning, & thought best to let her
know lest any particular message might be contained. Please tell Mother,
between yourselves, that father told brother Chandlee at Enniscorthy that
he did not want the cost, else it should have been sent: also that Kathy
Dunn asks 4s..10 1/2 d for quilting Capt. Pexton's quilt, (tho' for sister or her
particular frds. she would do it less) & intends having Mother's petticoat done
against 5th. day, when I expected to bring it home - If any one was going to
Athy I would be glad sister knew of this alteration, as she wanted us to engage to dine
with her on our way. Farewell, my dear love, thy affectionate Wife, wch. I am
[underline]proud[/underline] to subscribe myself. Mary Leadbeater

My dear friend
Its pleasant, and flattering (which is not always profitable)
that my kind friends at Ballitore are again desirous of seeing
me there, and sure its a strong proof of thy friendship that thou
hast given up thy half to come for me, but be assured: I wou'd not
have suffer'd this if I had known or thought of her making so short
a stay, its just likeing sending her to make her friends here dissatisfy'd
for they are so fond of her and the time so short that its out of her power
to please them, and it shames me that she shou'd take such a journey
account without gratifying her other friends, so that my
friend, I hope on considering this with the circumstances Molly h[unclear][/unclear]
mentioned that it will prove sufficient to make thee consent freely to our
not going untill seconday, and if thou could pursue the plan laid down
it wou'd give several here pleasure, Mary Lynes is rejoiced at the
thoughts of it and sends thee dear Love, another thing is against our
going, sixthday is monthly meeting and probable Brothers chair may
be wanting to convey some friend. (he hires it without a horse) excuse
us both for disappointing thee, and believe me we will rejoice to see
thee as well as other of my beloved friends, present my best love where
acceptable, to my dear Sally be sure, I am thy friend
M. Bewley
