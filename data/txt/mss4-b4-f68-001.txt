I garnish my salutation with some intelligence from Dr. [unclear]RB[/unclear]
received from Edenburgh in his Letter dated the 24 Ulto and poem
just out of the Mint wrote by Thos Wilkinson who was with D Duckett
accompanied him, they and had been in the Highlands for a Considerable
time 15 Weeks and had 111 Meetgs & generally large at Inverary
the Duke & Duchess of Argyle with their Children attended and
conversed familiarly with em after Meeting, & behaved very
respectfully, At St. Andrews it was of the professors & several of
the students attended several Meetings they had in that Ancient
place of Outward learning, & expressed their satisfaction, And
it was singular he says to find among them, some who were
very ignorant of our religious principles & Mode of Worship
& some expressed their satisfaction that misapprehensions were
now removed, One of the professors spent part of two Evenings
with em to mutual satisfaction - My Dr. friend may now think
it time for me to retire out of this arduous line, None can desire
it more than I do, I have often attempted to divert my self from
it & turn my Mind towards my Brethren & home but hitherto it
only yielded perplexity I have while out in the line indeavoured
