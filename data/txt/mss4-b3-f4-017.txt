My dear Uncle & friend

	Am I nobodies Child? if I am poor I trust I am not proud  my stock fit for exhibition I acknowledge decreases, but what then? theres the more room for the better treasure of my friends, & ought they to cease to be kind, to do good & communicate when my substance ^is taken from me? this would be to verify the old saying that when poverty comes in at the door love goes out at the windows  I suspect not this to be Ballitore friendship  it is unlike the integrity of my dear Uncle Shackletons family & yet what can I think  my coming to this Land was in fear & dismay  my confidence in the extension of holy help seemed low & in my own strength still lower  my mouth or those faculties by which utterance is formed have lain much in the dust as to pleasing communications ^in this line^ & I conclude it was better that it should be so or else the word of consolating exhortation would not have been withheld from a Father in Israel, a friend & Correspondent
I have however been partaker of more good than I deserved  my companions have been instructive valueable [sic] ones to me  my spirit has often been humbled  my own infirmities have glared before me & for thee [?] deep heart felt sense of what I am, thankfulness like a garment has inclosed every salutary dispensation  may I ever be found worthy to unite the living in this Land as well as in my own in a humble dedicated walking through this mixed state of things to the endless repose of wearied spirits  to do our best in religious services is to be sure our indispensable duty, but to be fit to ^us^ any thing is an abundant part of my care & I ^often^ am afraid not enough so neither 
I feel renewedly the salutation of much love to thyself, dear Aunt Shackleton, Cousin Aby & Lydia, ^Cousin^ Molly Nanny & M. Hudson  an encreasing nearness covers [?] my mind to Abraham & his wife & their establishment on the pure & sure foundation is more interesting to me than to me than with my scanty allowance of time I shall attempt to describe, but this I may 
say, that I have believed them intended for Pillars whereon many arduous services in the Church must depend: may their loins be girt about with divine strength & their drooping spirits sustained in times of greatest trial so as in due time to endure (as good Soldiers) greater degrees of hardness than they have yet they have experienced  they have the secret sympathy of their poor friend & fellow traveller S. G.  George has been today to look at a ship bound for Whitehaven which if the wind continues is intended to sail tomorrow morning at ? past nine & we all incline to go in it, so that we have now a multiplicity of engagements in which is intermixed the kind adieus of our friends  Oh may the blessing of preservation be graciously vouchsafed to those that go & those that stay, that by our humble abiding under it, Zebulum may rejoice in his goings out & Issachar in his Tent  remember us dear friend, intercede for us, commune with us at the Fountain & let us all be of good cheer
farewell
S. R. Grubb
PS Our affectionate salutation is to dear Anna Taverner & the young women where she is  we have this evening go account of S. Emlins [?] safe arrival at Phila.  I have received a letter from my Brother John, he says T Ross [?] is rather better but has been very ill, that they have had the small pox in the school at York & Hannah Bellerby [?] a fine young woman about 15 is dead in them a great affliction I know it will be to her relations & our family  Sister Mable has not had them, neither has Brother Johns Children, Henrys have got finely through  my companions unite in dear love to you all  Rebecca bids me tell thee that she has got thine & Cousin Mollys letters [in-line change in handwriting] R. Jones is allowed to splice the foregoing  She unites in the fervent desire expressed on dear A & Ls account also takes in dear Molly & Sally with thy other Children: may they approve themselves the Lords Children, and obedient to his divine requirings in all things  that instead of the Parents (when removed from the field of action) there may be the Children, who may also do valiantly  I am straitned for time: but have amidst the present hurry some gratitude in my composition that loves to feel obliged by such favours as those recently from Ballitore Have me dear friends in your Remembrance as I am: a poor feeble Child, yet hope in a teachable disposition: may we be provided with access in Spirit to the father of mercies & pray for each others preservation now & forever  Farewell dearly R Jones
Excuse our sending without a frank, we have not one
