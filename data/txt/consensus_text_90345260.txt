their safe[deletion]ly[/deletion] arrival. "Here I am at
Orange Hill actually" begins Lilly. I
hope Papa now that he is there, may
prolong his visit. Poor Margt!, I
hope her turn for the country air will
soon come. While I write, Ellen plays
at a dashing rate on the piano, Erasmus
lies at full length on the sofa, resting
his weary limbs, Philip I suppose on
his way home from Ballyman, where
he now spends nearly all his day.
I am now reading Hooker's travels, but
am making but slow progress.
25th.. Seventh day. The children went down
with Mama in the covered car to Bray
and seemed to enjoy the drive poor wee
things. Did not read much to
day, too much mending & do, this being
the day appropriated to that business.
Papa returned this evening. left
Polly very well and just like her old
self. Oh when shall I see thee again!
happy time! not far distant I hope.
