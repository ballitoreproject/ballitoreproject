19th of 12th mo 1828
My dear Elit.
I write lest you should be disappointed
in not hearing from us altho no change
has as yet taken place this is the 12th day
she lies very quietly & sometimes I
think she sleeps we keep her head
constantly wet with eau de Colong
[unclear]water[/unclear] mix'd dropping it from
a sponge, she takes very little drink
& does not like to stir at all she knows
us all but never speaks unless to answer
us except this one she ask'd to go to my
bed, she picks her poor lips till they
bleed, E Gough is as kind as [unclear]Mstel[/unclear]
can be I will never forget it to her
19th ever thy SB
