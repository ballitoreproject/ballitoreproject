O thou [deletion]art gone, beloved[/deletion] [insertion]beloved[/insertion] lamented & revered
To every heart which knew thy worth endeard
Thy virtuous race is run & thou art gone
Where pain & sin & sorrow are unknown
Pure was the splendor of thy lengthen'd day
For eighty years ordain'd on earth to stay
Walking a blest example on thy way
For whether [deletion]bent[/deletion] [insertion]crush'd[/insertion] beneath affection's blast
Thou meekly waited till the storm was past
or when prosperity's full cup oerflowd
Send on thy[deletion] thankful[/deletion] [insertion]grateful[/insertion] bosom joy bestow'd
Thou wert the same in all estates. - thy mind
Patient & lowly, thankful & resign'd
No more thy looks of love thy friends shall meet
Thy cordial welcome & thy converse sweet
But thou the Xtian warfare hast maintained
and the long conflict the reward hast gained

Thus shall they conquer who like thee rely
On Him who [unclear]listens[/unclear] to the humble cry
A present help in every deeper nigh
