York 8th month 13th 81

My dear & honoured Friend
	In remembrance of thy kind request to hear from me & a grateful feeling of the favor I received by thy interesting & very instructive sentences from London, I can do no less than accept Fathers offer of inclosing a few lines in his frank, for notwithstanding I am mistress of one of my own, I have thus far looked upon it so great a treasure that (miser like) my heart could not expand enough to bear a separation  By adopting a lifeless object for our misplaced regard, how stagnant may our feelings grow? & like the substance of a contracted mind thats never turned out, can consequently never return with usury  I did however premeditate if this conveyance had not been offered me to effect by one means or other that enlargement in which I might be able to express my affectionate feelings & obligation I sensibly experience myself under to a beloved Friend & Father in the Church  many Instructors we have, but few who are qualified by having passed through the gradations, from infancy to manhood & have then received a measure of the authority & holy tenderness of the Father of the Family to nurture up Children in the admonition of the Lord  My lot is fallen in a good land & in the consideration of an unworthyness of the multiplied favors dispensed, there must a grateful acknowledgement rise, that we have large possessions  our ideas of things are often very unequal to the subjects of them & that which to the natural eye may appear but small & greatly inferior to the treasure of others, yet when it is seen in the discoveries of truth, how far is exceeds our desert & what our hearts in their natural state could have craved, the murmurings of self are abolished, the complaint of difficulties ceases & the query from renewed feelings of divine favor steps in  what shall I render unto thee
The use of our treasure both religious & social often appears to me to require ^daily^ direction & instruction from the fountain of that which is pure, that we neither prostitute it by an unprofitable exertion of the natural powers & faculties of the mind which would gladly assume authority to govern & point the course of things, that thereby self might have some enjoyments & become of some reputation in its own sight & in the sight of others; nor ^that they^ prevent the circulation of living virtue from animating the least vessels in the hidden man of the heart, by too timorously fixing our eye upon the holy benevolence of the spirit of truth  The danger of erring on the one hand or on the other & in the the [sic] most important matters of either adopting an unsanctified zeal & touching things sacred without the previous preparation of the live coal [?]; or for want of being enough bound to the law & to the testimony & attaining a state of passiveness in the divine hand, there should be a falling short in the work assigned & firmly abiding by the laws, has often affected my mind with a deeply impressed fear that by one means or other there will be a falling by the hand of the Enemy, but my attention is suddenly called to consider the lililes how they grow  beautiful simplicity indeed & a striking evidence how unnecessary it is to toil & to spin [?], when if we could be quiet & take root downwards our cloathing would not require our ingenuity to prepare it, nor our own sense for approbation  I know ^not^ how I have hit in this subject it was far from my mind when I begun nor have my doubts & reasonings of late been quite equal to what they were heretofore, but instead thereof I have ^been^ thankful to feel a little anchoring upon that hope which lives within the vail, a degree of willingness hath been wrought that the master should form into such a vessel as he saw meet whether of honour or of dishonour & an eye hath been opened to see the excellency of the Cause of Truth & how worthy it is of the reduction of self & the dedication of the whole heart may the theory be reduced to practice & the honour which cometh from God only be sought.
We have wished to hear from thee sincerely since thy return & had the satisfaction of hearing of thee that thou got well home, no doubt to the ^a^ general rejoicing at Ballitore  Thy missing us at York was not unfelt by the several branches of this family  those who have not seen thee 
with those who have ^would^ be highly gratified to receive ^thee for^ their guest & allow me to say that I believe my dear & domestic Friend could not fail of feeling an equal pleasure in seeing some plants in this House  My dear Brother Henry & our beloved Friend M.M.Scot [?] are likely in a few weeks to accomplish their design  They are to live near us, but one house between which is a circumstance highly pleasing to us  Maria is a young woman of extraordinary abilities & possessor of amiable qualifications & as her mind becomes more & more regulated & bound by the girdle of truth she will become a singularly pleasing character
	Cousin Sally Hoyland has been out some time on the east side of this County, has with her Companion E. Whetherald [?] visited Friends families at Scarbro & Whitby  it has been a trying dispensation to be cast ^to^ the seat of rebellion against the principles of our profession & have to stay several weeks, but it has been considerably alleviated by their having for about one week the company of our valued Friends S.N. & E.H. [?] who are now got westward; we were favored with their company at our last monthly meeting when Brother & Maria declared their intentions  Please remember me very affectionately to Debby  I wish her more than I say & feel myself allied to the several branches of thy family  to Peggy there seems a tie I cannot describe  indeed ^I^ should love to see her, but these Husbands & Children how we see them fetter & fasten the mind as with strong cords?  now if Peggy had not been thus bound to things almost inseparable, she might have come with thee to last yearly meeting then I should have seen her, might perhaps have had her down with us & commenced a lasting profitable acquaintance with each other, but alas the case is otherwise & contentment in such cases when [word crossed out] ^I^ can attain it seems my best alternative  My dear Mother is writing & I hope thoul [sic] either read my letter first & make up thy mouth with hers, or else lay mine bye till thou can do no better than read it, seasons which I hope do not often return upon thee  I have need to apologize for my freedom but I consider its one of the peculiarities of a 
Parent especially when standing in the honourable station of a grandsire to wink at the ungoverned liberty of their Children  with this salvo Ill endeavor to rest & subscribe myself with endeared affection thy greatly obliged Friend S. Tuke
PS Brothers & Sisters write me in dear love to thy wife & whole family

Mother tells me she cant [sic] get her letter finished for this ^days^ post & charges me to filling paper: what subject to begin on I really do not know for my fund of matter is so shallow that for ought I know I just exhausted it with the above signature  what comes now must pass under the operation of squeezing (as I remember thy Sally said in a letter to thee) like cheese curd  However to begin, I may inform thee that Father & Mother have seven Children, how many more the latter may have in your land & this I really cannot tell, but the subject of the seven is copious enough for me at present, therefore be it known that Henry the eldest a native of the inclosed Garden & an improving plant therein is just on the point of being dug about & pruned by the dispensation of mentioning ^in the experience whereof^ we trust a lilly will grow by his side  the next is a daughter whose name is Sarah & whose heart is a little of the adamantine kind, but having been hammered & broken, melted & maade again she now moves as a piece of mixed metal which nothing but the ^renewal of^ fire itself can wholly separate  she is bound to her Fathers house & her Fathers house is bound to her  William the second son is a husbandman with G.[?] Burgess, an oak of Bashan which is bending a little because the axe has touched the root  he is in want of a small but good farm  John is a surveyer [sic] of land & a little akin by nature to the cedared in Lebanon, his doors however have not been wholly shut to the essentially necessary flames, nor have some of the branches escaped their effects  he is at home & seeking to settle in business  Elizabeth the second Daughter is possessed of good common sense & industriously pursuing useful things  her residence is generally at Bradford with an honourable aged Grandmother & a valuable Uncle to whose wants she is peculiarly attentive  Ann the third Daughter is the picture & fashion of her Mother  she strongly denotes that her Education has been & still is as at the foot of Gamaliel, she is sagacious, religion & firm as a Rock but matters not wasting her good understanding upon domestic things 
Mabel is a little stirring volatile piece of stuff  is very useful in jobbing about & other good properties which render her tolerable  she has a great deal of sensibility & makes many observations, her disposition is very tender & affectionate in fine she is a lovely plant & the pet of the house  Are we not a fine group now, excluding the adopted children in the family who are all useful in their places? Do come & see us & fail not to instruct us in the use of the bow  I could wish when thou seest Lucy Strangman to be affectionately remembered to her  she appears to be one of those intended for use & perhaps feels a willingness to it when hosanna is the reigning language of the heart & the master so appears in triumph that all who see believe but how different is the dispensation wisely allotted for the trial of faith & the exercise of patience, when in the work assigned & in our sight of the cause there is neither form nor comliness [sic] that when we behold it we should desire, nothing with which our minds in their natural state can acquiesce nor their powers have any share till they are renovated in the mystery of the sanctifying operation of the spirit of truth?  By doubting & reasoning on the rectitude hereof [?] how many a wilderness journey has been protracted which might have been 
far otherwise if in strippednes of self gratification & with devotedness & simplicity of heart the query had been made.
	What good thing shall I do  How many a stroke do we need to accomplish a death to ourselves, to experience a life hid in the immortal deed & a feeling that is is [sic] our meal & our drink to do the divine will?  there is no doubt but our dear Friend is on the way to this necessary knowledge & my mind has often nearly sympathized with her under the apprehension that the bitterness of death is not past. Cousin G.[?] Hoyland desires to write me in dear love to Lucy to thyself & every Branch of thy family  farewell affectionately & if freedom allows thee favor me in future not only with thy sweet remembrance but with tokens thereof  I am already more than I can express thy obliged & very affectionate S. Tuke
