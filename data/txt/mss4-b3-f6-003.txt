My very Dear Friend/
	after long expecting a line ^to hear^ from thee, I at last received thine, & was glad thou had not forgoten [sic] me: but our Good Remembrancer is still mindful of his People; at times causing us to receive of his favour, & inlargeing [sic] our hearts, & then can we desire the welfare one of another, which I can truely [sic] say has often been the case with me, for thee, since we parted, & oh I still greatly desire that thy good master, (in whose cause ^thou^ has been engaged) may support thee thro all the difficulties & as it were walls of opposition, that his & thy enemies may cast in the way: & my Dear friend [words crossed out] thou knows he will thus help his, while their whole repentance is on him, & while they abide in his counsel & wisdom
Oh that we could be as wise a [sic] serpents & harmless & [sic] doves, & I believe the nearer we keep to our wise teacher, the greater measure of this state we shall witness, may we ever do so, & look deeply , & listen attentively, to see & hear what he requires of us, that so we may act to his honour; I have often thought of the hard work thou had to do in this city, & suppose has been thy lot some time since thou lift [sic] it, hard indeed, but he that commands, can give strength to obey, [sic]
	Our dear friend Samuel [illegible] came to town the day thou left it, & was led to back what thou had dropt, in a perticular [sic] manner I think, & to continue doctrine of pritty [sic] much the same sort, which I was glad off [sic] & several more, for thou has friends in this place for all thou may think so many seemed the contrary, our dear friends J: Churchman & companion, M: Miller & his, are come to town to this meeting, & several other dear friends who I was glad to see, among whom was those thou mentioned in thy letter, & Richard whose dear love is to thee. I have likwise [sic] seen the friends that lives near thee whose name is Fargason [sic], & thy Brother, I wish many more in a general way was concerned to come up to these meetings & I doubt not but they would find benefit in it.
