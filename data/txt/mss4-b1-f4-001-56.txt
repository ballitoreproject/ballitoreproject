the testimony of Jesus. They despised that shame and false
delicacy, which was for saving self, and the honour and
reputation, and estimation of self: they made a sacrifice
of all, a whole burnt-offering, unto the Lord their God:
they chose rather to suffer affliction with his people, than
to enjoy the transient, unsubstantial pleasures of sin for a
season: they patiently bore the cross, and, doubtless, now
wear the crown which fadeth not away, as all earthly
grandeur does. Let my dear Cousin Mary M. read this.
I love her, and the numerous good qualities which she is
possessed of. I wish her to join thee hand in hand, that ye
may go up together to the house of the Lord, (the place where
his honour dwells,) rejoicing in feeling the approbation of
Heaven to your spirits, and cemented in a spiritual as
well as natural union. ***
And now, my very dear Lydia, farewell. May thou
and thy husband be graciously continued objects of Divine
regard and help, prays
Your truly affectionate father
R. S.
