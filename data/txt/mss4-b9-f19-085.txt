My dear E- I rec.d thy
this enc & send this by M
Byrne I hope my father's
leg continues to mend, we
had no idea here how sore
it was till thy letter came
Mt is very crop shile & in great
pain occasionally with her teeth
tho' none have appear'd since
we left Ballitore I intend
sending D's clothes trunk
by M Wright [unclear]&[/unclear] I miss E & D
greatly we are quite silent
& lonely, I hope my mother
can come soon she could
get any book she wanted
here on the spot from the
Library which may be an

inducement to her to hasten
with dear love to her & my
father I conclude as Mick
waits thy SB
dear love to Deb tell her how
I miss her
Winny takes her
