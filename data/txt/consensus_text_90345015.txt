Margt. at the meeting
house where business
detained her, returned
home executing some
little shopping on our
way home. Coming
up Britain street we
met Thomas H White
who had called to leave
a little box which he
borrowed for his watch
which was broken at
Fassaroe. Aunt E &
Uncle Thomas dined
with us; the former
was asking me if
I had got permission
to go down to the North
with them, when
they are going.
