& also thy sauce tureen but cannot send them
at present as Eben goes in the night Coach
Willie is much better I was frighten'd

his bowels which lasted two days, I hope
my father is better Edw brought a pretty
good account of you, - M Chambers mends,
his spirits are wonderfully good I have
not heard any account of things I sent by
M Barrington & also some paper to [unclear] M White[/unclear]
I hope they got safe to Ballitore
the china came quite safe jelly & apples
for all of which I am much obliged I have two
baskets of thine [insertion]one of[/insertion] which I would have sent home
