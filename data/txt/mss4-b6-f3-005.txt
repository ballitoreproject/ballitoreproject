Lisburn 7 mo 23rd 1809
I am much obliged to thee, my dear Friend, for copying
Betsy's dialogue, & for thy very kind & acceptable letter. The
dialogue & poetry were immediately forwarded to Belfast,
& are both inserted in the July magazine which will be
published in a few days - My Father intends sending one
number of all the Magazines published to the proprietors
of the Ballitore Magazine in return for their kindness
in sending so many things to the Belfast Magazine -
This may serve as the commencement of their library, as
thou knows all literary societies should have a joint
library. I have not succeeded yet about Betsy's
gloves; however I am not despairing, so I will hope for
some success. Please tell her that immediately on receipt
of her letter I wrote to Betsy Johnston mentioning the
price of the gloves & I have had a note from her which
says "I am sorry to say that Miss Allen declines taking
the gloves, as the price is exactly Ferriar's, an eminent
glover in Dublin; he gives 6 months credit which makes
them a little cheaper. I will do all in my power to serve
your friend, & will call at some other shops, but I am
not very sanguine in my hopes of success, as the gloves
as loud in their praise; but I can assure her the praise is given by the liberal &
most respectable party, the others say that 1797 & 1798 ought to be for ever
forgotten, & blotted from the remembrance of Irishmen; but Irishmen's
memories are not quite so obedient, & they cannot readily forget their sufferings -
Please give my dear love to Betsy Shackleton & tell her I will
write to her very soon - The gentleman that my father lent the Reports
for bettering the condition of the poor, lost the volume which gave an account
of the Straw bonnet manufacture; I have got my father to write to London
for that Volume and as soon as we get it, I will copy what Betsy wishes -
I have written a sad scrawl for my throat is very sore & writing has made
my head very ill, so thee will excuse this miserable scrawl - With love
to Elizabeth, Deborah, Mary & Mary Shackleton I am my dear Friend most
sincerely thy affectionate S Hancock
If any of the books I have mentioned answer thy plan please let me
know, & I will send them the first opportunity

which are sold in the Repository (a charitable institution for
the benefit of genteel families who are in poverty. & [insertion]who can[/insertion] support
themselves by doing fancy work &c) prevents the shopkeeper
from getting much sale for that article." I have written to
Moyallon about the gloves, & Betsy may be assured that if
I do not succeed it will not be for want of zeal & exertion
in the cause. We have not any of the books thou wishes
for except Gordon's Rebellion - Thou will be very welcome to have
that book & any of the following thou wishes for. Hay's History
of the insurrection in Co. Wexford. O'Halloran's History of Ireland.
& Leland's History of Ireland. I think I could borrow two books
for thee if they would answer thy purpose. The first is entitled
"Pieces of Irish History" written & published in America by Thomas
Addis Emmett & Dr. McNevin - it gives a history of the [deletion]of the[/deletion] first
organization of the United Irishmen - & many [insertion]other[/insertion] very interesting things.
The other book is written by Counsellor Sampson who was
obliged to leave this country for one not at war with
England; he chose Portugal, but he was soon put into prison
there, he says by order of the British government; after a
variety of romantic adventures he got to France, where he
was joined by his wife & family, but upon the death of
Pitt & C. J. Fox coming into administration he came to
England, but was obliged to go to America, as he would not
be [deletion][/deletion] [insertion]permitted[/insertion] to continue in England. He now follows his
profession of a Counsellor in America, & his wife & family
live in Belfast. I can furnish thee with two anecdotes
which puts the noble disposition of the Irish in a most
amiable point of view. I do not remember the facts, but I have

often heard the anecdotes from undoubted authority. During
the rebellion of 1798 several people who were supposed to be
[deletion][/deletion] [insertion]concerned[/insertion] in the insurrection were hung in this town - among
the number was a man of the name of Armstrong who,
when he was on the scaffold, was entreated to turn informer,
he refused, threats & bribes were then used, but to no effect,
His wife was then sent to say his life would be spared if
he would inform & entreated him to do so: his answer was
"I will not turn informer, if I die I leave one widow & one
orphan, but if I tell all I know I will make make many widows
& orphans." He was hanged & his head, according to a savage custom
was put with two others on spikes on the market house,
where they remained until the Earl of Breadalbane on marching
thro' this town with his regiment, ordered [deletion][/deletion] [deletion][/deletion] [insertion]them[/insertion]
down. On the 16th of May 1797 four of the soldiers
[unclear][/unclear] Monaghan militia were brought from Belfast to the
[unclear][/unclear] at Blaris two miles from Lisburn, to be shot
for being United Irishmen - They were repeatedly offered
pardon & rewards if they would inform on their associates -
They chose death before doing a dishonorable action, & met
their fate with firmness - The father of one of the men was
desired to interfere, but he would not as he would never
encourage his son to turn traitor. The un[insertion]i[/insertion]ted Irishmen
made a handsome provision for the families of these men -
some soldiers of a Highland regiment were desired to shoot
these men, which they refused to do - This circumstance
occasioned the following Impromptu, which is generally attributed
to Dr. Brennan.
When bid to take aim at the Irishman's heart,
The stout Caledonian recoil'd with a start; -

"The first of my country, the first of my clan,
"Ever ordered to fire on [deletion]thy[/deletion] a blindfolded man;
"You'll find fitter tools to perform such a deed,
"And by Irish hands let the Irishman bleed,
"In the spirit of Cain let them murder each other,
"And the United fall by his United brother."
So the Irish went first, and the Irish went last,
And guarded by Irish the prisoners pass'd;
On their coffins knelt down, took a silent farewell -
The United men* fired, the United men fell.-
*The author of this impromptu had supposed that almost all the
militia were United Irishmen -
It would gratify me very much if Deborah would let the Address
to the Sun be sent to me - Please tell her that I gave her letter to
Betsy to read, but I did not like to disfigure thy letter by cutting
Betsy's letter out. Mary Shackleton's dialogue has caused a great
deal of talk, as one party are violent in their censures, & the other
Single
