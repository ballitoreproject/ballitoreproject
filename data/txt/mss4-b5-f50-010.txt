30 Aungier-street 3 Month 11 - 1819.
My dear friend,
I received thy letter dated the 10th ult.
with respect to thy message to Joseph Humphreys about Anne
Frank, as it is doubtful whether I shall write to him at all
& if I do, it probably will not be long before his return,
I intend to snd it to him through Joseph Gayle, Doctor before
or some other of his correspondents, when I know of
one of them writing. I am glad thou hast received favourable
intelligence from my Aunt Harvey, with respect to
Catherine Fratton's prospects, I heartily hope she may be
successful, as her design springs from much excellent motives
It is not likely that I shall see her to confer with her
about this affair, as I am never in or near that quarter
where she resides - Are you likely to receive a visit from
the philanthropie Bonhams, I think I heard something of
it? - Joseph Humphreys left a parcel of [unclear]Camparpe's[/unclear] with
me before he went to give to [unclear][/unclear] together with some divinations

from thee which we did not seem to understand. I have
them at present under my care & shall be glad to receive
thy orders [insertion]as to [/insertion]what I am to do with them - I hope
thy under[insertion] as to[/insertion] what I am to do with them-- I hope
thou doth not let Lydia [underline]totally[/underline] neglect her Latin, amidst
the multiplicity of her other studies, she will find such
knowledge very useful in her scientific pursuits. - I have
seen a work of Crabbe's lately advertised, entitled "Tales of
the Hall;" is that the same as " Recollections" or a separate
work? - Hast thou been able to snatch any time for the
perusal of Madam de Stael's admirable "Reflections on
the French Revolution." - At the last meeting of the Literary
& Scientific Society, we had an essay from Joshua Abell
on the "Antiquities of Ireland." - I gave the letter
for New York (inclosed in Lydia's to me) to Joseph Todhunter
to forward by the next vessel - Joseph Fayle, Edward
Alexander & I drank tea last week at Anna Fayle's
in company with Lorenzo Dowe & Doctor Johnson. I was
very arguably disappointed with Lorenzo, we all found him
an exceedingly entertaining & intelligent companion. He wears
a beard, which is certainly no [underline]ornament[/underline] to his face, & that, together

with his long hair which he suffers to grow down his shoulders,
gives him a slovenly appearance, which is not at all
prepossessing - I had a letter on third day from my father,
he says of my grandmother that "she is much as she has
been for some months past. She has not gone out since the
winter set int, but she receives visitors, & seems to enjoy them.
winter set in, but she receives visitors, & seems to enjoy them.
Her speech is not improved, altho' electricity has been
resorted to." - He says also: "The last account from
Jacob Harvey was I think about a fortnight ago. He
got quite stout after his illness." - Hast [unclear]th[/unclear]
Buxton's admirable speech on Capital Punishments?
thou wilt soon reply to this " currente calamo" not
"viva voce" I remain thine affectionably
If thou canst not interpret
the Latin, I refer thee
to Lydia's [underline]head[/underline] not her [underline]dictionary[/underline].
