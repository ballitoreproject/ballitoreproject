imagine a more enviable character, than an Irish
landlord, who resides amongst his tenantry, and endeavours
both by example and precept, to lead them
into paths of morality & virtue. - who institutes schools
for their mental improvement, & distributes premiums
to those, who merit them, for agricultural advancements -
Thou knows full well how such a man is
adored, & how amply he is repaid, for [deletion]t[/deletion]his philanthropical
endeavours, by the exuberance of gratituide
which a happy tenantry lavish on him!
The fourth of this month, being the 42d
anniversary of American Independence, was celebrated
with much noise & nonsense, in every
city, town & village throughout the Union. In
New-york we had our full share, but as I had witnessed
the ceremony before (& once seeing it sufficeth,)
I was glad to escape the bustle, & spent
the day quietly within doors. Thou must know,
that this is always a holyday - & if thou can imagine
an Irish Fair, without business, crowded to excess
by the Country lads & lasses for miles around, (allowing,
however one third to be [underline]blacks[/underline]), well variegated
with tents, booths, stands &c, flags flying
in all directions, squibs, pistols & small cannons

keeping up a continual hedge firing - it will give
thee a pretty good idea of this National Festival.-
however it is necessary to add, that ten or a dozen
Societies of [insertion]the[/insertion] different kinds of tradesmen, bearing their
emblems &c, march in procession after a grand
model of a first rate Ship of War, which is drawn
through the streets by six horses. After a sufficient
display has been made, & half the City perambulated,
the Members of the Procession, form a sort of Congregation,
in a Building prepared for the purpose, where
some person appointed before hand, reads the original
declaration of Independence, & [insertion]perhaps[/insertion] extracts from
the speeches of their most noted sages. - If the gentleman's
oratorical abilities admit of it, he generally
concludes the meeting with a fulsome oration, in
which, the extravagant praises lavished on America
are only equalled, by the dreadful picture he
[underline]most feelingly[/underline] draws of the tyranny excercised in
Europe! The loudest plaudits ascend the skies from
the enraptured audience who, catching the Inspiration
which imboldens the speaker to foretel
what [underline]will be be[/underline], regard as [underline]certain[/underline], the unparalleled
encrease of American prosperity, which he
[underline]modestly[/underline] pictures, in the distant prospective!

Honourable mention should also be made of the
Soldiers, or Citizens transformed, who add no little
to the spectacle of the day. These worthy "Sons of
Mars" (hundreds of whom never heard a gun fired,
but on a review day - of which there are 3 or 4 in the
year) accoutred in various uniforms, are forced into
ranks, & measure half the streets in the City, being
allowed, however, to kill time by smoking Segars
& talking to each other - they cut a very picturesque
appearance, & were it not for the firelocks, might
pass for any thing, as well as soldiers!
It is very proper to continue the annual celebration
of this day, inasmuch as it reminds the people
that their Forefathers once fought for the Liberties
they now enjoy - a circumstance which might
otherwise slip their treacherous memories!
About 11 miles distant, on Long
Island, is a small town called Flushing, where
there are so many Friends, it may almost be
called a Colony of them - something like Ballitore -
with the exception, their houses are farther asunder
than yours. Most of them once lived in the City,
but having amassed considerable fortunes, have
retired to this sequestered spot, in order to enjoy
the remainder of their days.
"From the tumult & smoke of the City set free."

This is a place of great resort, for those Citizens who
have any acquaintances there, particularly during
the summer season. It is usual to go up on seventh,
& come down on second day. What renders it very
attractive to the young men, is the number of fine
girls residing in the neighbourhood. - I spent a
most agreeable day there, not long since, & received
so much hospitality, I could almost fancy myself
in Ireland. The friends are very hospitable in general,
& keep open house for the Citizens, to whom, they
say, 'tis a luxury to enjoy the fresh air of the Country
for a few days. - Their farms are highly cultivated,
& the surrounding scenery rich & picturesque. -
Were I to settle as a farmer in America, no spot
would please me so much as Flushing, or its neighbourhood,
both on account of its proximity to Newyork
& the charming Society it contains. Opposite
the Farm-house of one Friend, are two large, venerable
Oak-trees, under which George Fox preached while
in this Country - they are preserved with great care
& 'tis usual of for Strangers, to take with them some
of the Acorns, as mementos of the event.
We have just witnessed a splendid
Public Funeral in this City, which is something
uncommon. The remains of General Montgomery,
(killed 43 years ago in an unsuccessful & rash attempt
