that the people were in a great
fright in Kingstown having
felt it very plainly. Mama
who happened to be awake
at the time felt the bed shake
under her, [unclear]but[/unclear] thought it
was the boys who had to be
up at that time to send Murphy
to town - None of us out
here but Mama heard it -
It was the talk of the whole
town and indeed no
wonder. Poor Margt [deletion]heard[/deletion] felt
it in town, and was so
much frightened that she
jumped out of bed thinking
the house was coming down
on her.

and no sign of it clearing
