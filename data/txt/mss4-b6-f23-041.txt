When from the beautious parent tree
The opening bud was sent away
All rudely shaken might you see
Her dewy leaves bestrew the day
Ah[insertion]las[/insertion] what hand that wound shall find
Or call the bloom of hope again
What can sustain the drooping mind
Stung with unutterable pain
Represt the pangs which pierce his heart
Connubial Love will sooth the wo
and filial fondness would impair
all that such fondness can bestow

To
the Post Master
Ballytore
Sir
You will much oblige me If you
will forward any Letters [insertion]that may be[/insertion] directed to me (to your office
at Ballytore) to the Post office Kilcullen Bridge, where
I shall go tomorrow morning I hope you will excuse
this trouble, I am your obedt Affte
Servt
