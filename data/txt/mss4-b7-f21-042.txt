Tent Lodge Decr. 14 -
1818
Yes, my dear Friend, you did direct Thomas
Wilkinson to inform me of your Brother's death, & I
should have offer'd you, & his amiable Wife my condolences
had my health permitted- - I have been suffering from
a severe attack of Cholera Morbus, & after the most dangerous
symptoms were conquer'd, frequent relapses have
reduced me to so much weakness, that yesterday was the
first of my venturing out to Church - your sweetly soothing
Letter so interests [unclear]me[/unclear] I cannot suffer it to remain
unanswer'd, altho' writing is somewhat irksome to me -
The account you give of your family, is as good as
can be expected in this sublunary state - it is painful
to lose those we loved, but we must not sorrow as those
without Hope; - we trust to join them hereafter, & every broken
tie

makes us more willing to follow - your Schools of various
kinds must surely be productive of much Good, for they
all seem [underline]right[/underline]; I trust the benevolent Founders will be
gratified by witnessing their effects,- if not, there is a reward
in store for them, which Human ingratitude cannot injure
I thank you for Mr. Henry's lines; I have frequent testimonies
of the esteem attach'd to my Elizabeth's character, &
the Public have proved their opinion of her Works, by [insertion]their[/insertion] affording
a clear profit of Â£2,000 - My late Friend Elizabeth Hamilton
was a great Invalid, [underline]never[/underline] free from one sad disorder, &
frequently attack'd by other [unclear][/unclear] painful nature,- no wonder
then, if she sometimes express'd a little irritability,- but I
positively deny the charge of her "being impatient if not the
chief object of attention" - She had a great share of Wit, which
enabled her to make any subject she attack'd, so truly ridiculous
that those who felt conscious of deserving her [underline]just[/underline] - but playful Satire
never forgave it - Many a bonny Scot, & perhaps some of your Countrymen

will never pardon the Author of the Cottagers of Glenburnie - great
Talents, commonly excite Envy in little Minds, or now that Mrs. H
rests in peace, they would forget -
"The slighting words, thro' heedlessness severe,
Wounding the spirit that it ought to cheer,
Die buried in the Grave! or if they live,
Lie buried in the Grave! or if they live,
Remembrance wakes them only to forgive."
A 2d Edn. of her Memoirs is just coming out, with several addl.
Letters, I hope it will sell well for her Sister's sake, who is not
I fear in very affluent circumstances - I was promised a visit
from Mrs. Fry, & was greatly disappointed in receiving her excuse
instead of herself - No Charity that I ever heard of, bears the [unclear]leg[/unclear]
compar[unclear]ed with[/unclear] her exertions! I am told she nearly lives [unclear][/unclear]
scenes [unclear]of[/unclear] [unclear]dness[/unclear] & Guilt, & that her skill in touching the [unclear]le[/unclear]
hardest hearts, is truly wonderful,- She must be something Super-human!
I have often heard of Priscilla Gurney, & of her
human! I have often heard of Priscilla Gurney, & of her
sweet attentions to my darling Kitty, I wish I may ever have
an opportunity of personally returning my thanks- Dull, as
this Epistle is, if you knew my present weakness, you would
not be surprised - I will only beg you to remember me most kindly
to all my Ballitore Friends, with the assurance that their kindness
never is forgotten by Yours most Sincerely
The Cous. & Ju: are well, & so is
c[unclear]devant[/unclear] Turpin -
