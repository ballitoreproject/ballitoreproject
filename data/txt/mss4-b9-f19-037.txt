My dear Elizabeth
We can now breathe [deletion]after[/deletion] having at last had
a fine explosion for the Goodwins Rawsons & Davis's
yesterday evening- a fair display of figure & fashion
& I hope thou wont send us word to ask any other party
till thou art here to entertain them.
I know thoult be shock'd to hear of poor Biddy
Cody's death she had been a week ill.
A poor man a few days ago was found dead
in the Sandpit we did not know he had been there
till we heard of his death, this month's Magazine has
taken notice of the circumstance [deletion]s[/deletion] both in prose
& verse I will give thee the verse now if Lydia's
memory serves it is written by Richd Webb
The Wanderers Requiem 
Know, ye who seek for worldly fame,
Whose hearts are lifted up with pride, -
Among the people - without name
This lord of the Creation died
Twas from a friendless dying bed
No one to say- "Oh live for me"!
the spirit of the poor man fled.
To God & immortality.

Upon the Rock he laid him down to die,
Upon the Rock he threw each wearied limb
His Canopy the gloomy sky,
The roaring winds his funeral hymn!
We grow fonder of R W as the "time of his departure
draws nigh", my father is now reading the magazine
The time changes, it is now after tea & the 2 Editors
are here Richard very uneasy on his chair Theodore
sitting opposite to him, mimicking Jack Walsh.
My mother spent the day at the Mill.
Eliza Gough sends her love to thee she is
very comfortable in Molly Haughton's parlour.
As burdensome as J Lennons children [insertion]are[/insertion] to her
she hopes soon to have another. [deletion]thy[/deletion] many thanks
for thy enquiries about my toothache it is quite
gone. Tell Deborah that Eliza Thos Mary Anne &
Charlotte Poole went to Narraghmore last 1st.
day & there met Eliza's father & mother. there was
weeping & wailing but not wrath or blame Eliza's
father brought the coat on him that Eliza gave
him & thank'd her for it, she says it makes
him look quite young :it is very well made
even Thos cried both at meeting & parting. Eliza
says that the meeting put her in mind of the
meeting between Joseph & his father, -

M Moffett came for little Maria & took her
away she is a very sweet goodhumour'd little
creature We have got the 2nd vol: of R L Edgeworths
life & like it still better than the 1st I hope thoult
meet it before thou comes home.
John Byrne heard that Matt Nowlan was
dead & went to his wake & was much surprised
to find him putting down his supper intending
no doubt to live a little longer, I wish you'd
send Eben & Deborah home I think they have
staid away quite long enough. E Gough
who is here at present, tells Lydia that [unclear]she[/unclear]
[unclear]till indebted[/unclear] to Elizabeth for knowing [unclear][/unclear]
write a letter, I dont know how thoult
like Charlotte she is not near so smart or
clever as Jane but is very good humour'd
we had poor Hetty for a while & liked her very well
she looks quite picturesque particularly when
running after her little brother who is like a
young Hercules, Apropos we hear poor
Hercules Cambell has lost almost all his
property & has some prospect of getting
into the Army Bessie Coddington
paid us a visit to day I think her greatly
improved she has lost a great deal of her

scorn indeed I think all, Catherine looks
extremely interesting, we hear that Annie is
most admired perhaps for a fine pair of black
sparklers, Mary Green has lent Lydia Caroline
of Lichfield it is in french
Tommy Harvey is gone alas! alas!
Mary Fitzsimmons is come on a visit to
Sally she call'd on us last 1st day & said
how much obliged she was to thee for having
written to her, she speaks exactly as if she
was reading & used very hard words. We
had no singing last night as the Doctor was here S L
Thy books are perfectly safe were aired wiped, &c
