10th.. Fassaroe - Margt and I spent
a few hours this morning together
in the Exhibition where we met
Uncle Francis Aunt Lucy Reggie,
Frank, and Bancroft who had
come up this morning. As they
wished to take round through the
whole building, we did not stay
with them long but pursued our
own plan, that of inspecting the
beautiful china from Worcester,
which greatly pleased us. We saw
the plate which Prince Albert had
ordered; it represented Cupid &
or in other words the the
Bridal plateau. I think I should
have passed it over without giving
it a second look such my bad
taste. Polly & I have just come
out here with Papa - We expected
the Roberts to tea but they could not
come I believe
11th.. Went to meeting this morning
