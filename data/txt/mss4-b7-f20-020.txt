September 3rd 1818
Dear [unclear]Mrs[/unclear] Mrs Leadbeater
I am indeed very much concerned at the
loss which you so pathetically describe, it is a very [unclear]severe[/unclear] one, but
the death of the righteous ought not to be a subject of continued
regret. You seem to be able to look back on the actions of your
Brothers life with pleasure, which though for the present it increases
sorrow must ultimately bring consolation. I sincerely hope that it will
please God to support and comfort the afflicted wife and family,
who are bereaved of so near and dear a Friend.
I grieve to think that you have that terrible scourge the Syphlus
in Ballitore, I trust that divine providence will give efficacy
to the means used for eradicating this severe and dangerous
disease, and that it will respect Mr Shackleton, who deserves
universal thanks for his philanthropic exertions
I had the pleasure of being introduced to Mr Crabbe this
summer at Mr [unclear]Hoares[/unclear] at Hampstead, where I think we
heard that he would soon give another work to an admiring
World
I am very glad to hear so good an account of all your
Schools, and also of the Finn Family - I like much to have
them mentioned. It is a very particular pleasure to me that
Owen turns out so well. I hope that he will continue to be a useful

and worthy member of society, blessing and blest where e'er
he goes. What does he now now get a year for his employ. I suppose
that he is now nineteen years of age. Is he fond of reading? and
to what books has he access?
The pencil marks upon your manuscript were made by Mr Smith, perhaps
some few by my eldest Daughter.
Respecting Mr Shackletons communication to the Society for the
Encouragement of Art Manufacturers &c &c - Mr Smith says that
it was received with approbation, but had there been a reward,
he would in all probability have heard - something however may
perhaps yet transpire, but should your Brother chuse to enquire
by letter - we will forward it. It may be directed under cover to Mr Smith.
Adieu dear Mrs Leadbeater I am with much regard
Sept 3rd 1818
[unclear]Parndon[/unclear] House York
This is now our address
Sincerely yours
Frances Smith
