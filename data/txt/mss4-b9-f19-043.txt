Dear Elizabeth might
I not say sister - your
note, which I only received
yesterday relieved me
from the feeling that
through some inadvertence
I had offended you. This
indeed did, gave me pain
I could never do so willingly
there is nothing therefore
I can have for which to
excuse you. Permit [insertion]me[/insertion] to
thank you, to say I feel
your very kind attention
to me.
Would that it were [unclear]uneasy[/unclear]
Elizabeth Leadbeater

power to dissipate for ever,
or even alleviate the [unclear]unhapling[/unclear]
feeling you allude to.
If it be right to have them
[unclear]with[/unclear] why mind them.
My sister Lucy sends you
[unclear]momentel[/unclear] "me as'" as I
told, you would like to peruse
them. If you think the
three volumes of Florian
which accompany it worth
what [unclear]acceptancy[/unclear] it worth
your acceptance, for any
keep them for my sake
and thus convince your
brother Edward that you
think he has done nothing
for which he ought to
ask your cause.
