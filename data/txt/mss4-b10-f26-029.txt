and early when we started so that we could tell a little about the town, and
the people we saw in the morning seemed somewhat like the Bernese, only in their
working dresses - The Village we stopt at yesterday [insertion]to rest the horses & dine[/insertion] was small but in
a very pretty valley & at the Hotel at wh. we were there were stopping at the
same time 3 other large carriages full of tourists one of them with English
I think two - & whilst we were there there was a wedding of some of the
townspeople took place & we saw the Bride & Bridegroom & company walking
from the church to their house just opposite the Hotel - We arrived here in very
good time last evening - nearly the first thing was to try the port when we got Elizth
and the Doctors letter - we then had tea wh. we enjoyed very much, we then went
out to walk to see the town &c&.. our Hotel wh. is not [underline]a tip top[/underline] one is very
pleasantly situated between the bridge & the Grandest Hotel the 3 Kings (an
immense place enough to frighten one) - we have very nice rooms looking
out on the river - the Bridge seems the evening promenade & was quite
gay with people walking by moonlight last evening - Thos. & I took 2 or 3
turns on it last night after all the rest of our party had gone to bed -
Olivia & her family have gone out to pay a visit
she having acquaintances here & Emy & I sat down
to write tho' I think we shall not post the letter
 until we see shall we get [insertion]a[/insertion] letter from Dunlavin
today - 6 6th Sept We did not do or see much
yesterday Thos. & Olivia had many things to talk
about & arrange as we part here - She & her two
children remain here for a few days, at least
until they fix on some other place or hear again from the Doctor - we
are going to Paris from this by Strasbourg & are I believe to start by the railway
between 12 & 1 - Thos. has to go to the Bank for money - We had all an invite
out to tea last evening by some of Olivia's friends but we did not accept it
The weather has been very fine - I wish we had had it so amongst the
mountains - we have seen much less than I expected when we came
over but there were various reasons for not going to the most interesting
parts - I do not think Olivia either liked the fatigue or expence or the cold, and
as the chief object or one of them was to bring Georgie to his mama & to consult
about her affairs - another to see the Doctor in wh. we failed altogether - everything
else was only subservient to these & we must only come again to see the
parts we have missed if we lived & are not too old - of course I mean Thos. & myself in
the last remark - I think my enthusiasm about such things will outlive my bodily strenth

There are very many drawbacks to travelling that require energy to overcome
and one great one is the not being acquainted with the foreign languages
I wish I could persuade the young people of this & stimulate them to learn
[underline]whilst they are young[/underline] & when it is comparatively easy - but the English generally
are greatly behind hand in such things - it is surprising what a number of people
even of low rank we have met that could speak well both french & German & some
both Italian & English besides - I do not yet know what day we shall be home we
intend to stay a day at least in Paris to see the large gallery of the Louvre wh. was
closed all the time we were there before - it being under repair we could not see it
and I think we shall stay a day in London as [insertion]neither[/insertion] Thos. nor I have ever been at
the British Museum - but it will depend on our letters from home wh. we
expect at Mrs. Morres so do not let us be disappointed - Emily desires her love
& will be obliged by her letter being put in [underline]the very first post[/underline] after you receive
this - as yet she has not got the letter she expected here from Dunlavin - Thos. joins
me in dear love to you & all the home circle whom I trust I shall find all well
on my return - & how rejoiced I shall then be to be at home once more safe & well
after our journey - believe me my dear Mother ever your affect daughter
EHenry
 you will please to let Elizth see this
