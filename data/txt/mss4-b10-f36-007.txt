My dear Eliza
As there might chance to be an opportunity to
send thee a letter, I think it is a pity not to have one
in hands so that it might be ready at a short notice
I begin therefore this sixth day of the week, I do not recollect
what day of the month it is, and the almanac
is not here at present, I wrote to thee on fourth day
I believe it was, didst thou get it. We are here just as
usual all after our best fashion. Edward came
out to us last night to tea and staid to day untill
after dinner, he seems finely, and in pretty good
spirits. he intends going to England on first day I
believe; he did not tell me so himself, for when I
asked when he was going, he said he did not like
fixing any time it was so often put off. today
after breakfast my Mother Edward, little Richard &
myself went on the car to Moss's factory, [insertion]we[/insertion] went
by Lough Cavetown and the Smelting house road which
I believe is twice the distance; Moss himself
was not at home, but we saw his wife, a fat
comfortable looking woman, she wanted us to go
in and take a cup of coffee or some bread & cheese
thinking I suppose we had come from town, we
did not see the spinning to advantage at all
as they were only using up the dirty cotton to prepare
for a fresh stock. we are to go again when

he is at home. It is a queer see-saw place dirty
enough, we came home by Carrickmines & Cornelscourt
so that thou sees we were going round the
world for sport. there is scarcely a sign of spring
yet, the fields and hedges are as bare as need be.
I suppose you are not much more forward down
there. nothing strange or uncommon has happened
here since except that there was a young man
came here on seventh day last and asked for
me, it happened very fortunately that I was very
busy at the time making brown bread, with
my hands all over meal so that my Mother
had to receive him, when lo! & behold! all he
wanted was [underline]money[/underline]. he had been appointed
to collect a subscription in which the women
were never asked to join before, so I frankly told
my mother that I really had nothing to give
& so he had to go away not much better than
he came. guess who it was now, only James Webb [unclear]&[/unclear]
not thy James but my brother-in-law that
was [underline]not[/underline] to be!! thou wilt think this great
nonsense, but thou wilt excuse it, my Mother
took a use out of Frank she told him how a
young man came to ask for me, and said he
might tell it in town, so thou may be sure the
story did not lose by the carriage. but sure

let me condole with thee, [underline]thy bachelor[/underline] poor
fellow is all the way in London my Mother
wrote to him about business and the answer she
got was that Thomas Henry was in London but
that the Doctor opened all his letters while he
was away. did Frank tell the comical story
of the little English tailor and of Papa & Mama
leaving it all to Mr Linton. I am sure he made
us laugh heartily on seventh day when he was here
telling it. It is a good joke too and may be after
all if it goes on might turn out better than
many a match that is long considered about.
 I suppose thou & Eliz[underline]th[/underline] are all alone
tonight, Betsy & J Calvert being gone to
the meeting. I hope thou wilt take care
& not do any thing to give thee cold these
dreary evenings I am sure are not fit for thee to
be going out, Is Henry Allen very attentive and as
 fond of a bit of chat as ever, does he often pay thee
a visit. who is the Hannah Fisher thou mentions
I do not know her is she in Ballitore still.
Did Eben & Ellen go see thee yet, or wert thou at
Moone and didst thou see handsome [unclear][underline]Lack[/underline][/unclear].
So Thomas [unclear]Boakess[/unclear] is not tired of Byron or [unclear]Henours[/unclear]
and still spouts away, ask Elizabeth has he
spouted for her much since (he was one night
at M Doyle's very busy at it.) I think it speaks very
well for him & his [insertion]step[/insertion]mother that they like each other

so well. I told thee already I believe that we
were well here, and Arthur said they were well in
town. Emy is finely poor little thing she has a great
 frown, and looks Uncle Manliff says as cross as ever
she can, but I am in hopes when she gets all her teeth
that she will lose that fretted look. My Mother
intends going to town tomorrow if the Day be fine and
as I am so near the end of my sheet I may as well
send it in by her, she might chance to hear of some
one going, but for that it is not worth the postage except
to let thee know that we are all well. my
Mother sends her dear love, and I am sure I may
also say the same for Manliff & Arthur as I cannot
ask them at present thou mays also accept a share
from me thy affectte. Sister Selina
Eliza Barrington
Ballitore

be sure to write soon and give me a full & true account
of all thy proceedings my love to Elizabeth & Cousin Betsy
farewell. Didst thou give me a belt for the [unclear]tablinet[/unclear]
frock for I cannot find it any where & I do
not like to cut up the piece thou gave untill
I know please tell when thou write next.
