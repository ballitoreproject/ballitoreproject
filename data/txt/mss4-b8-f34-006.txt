Dear William
Phillipstown 8 mo-10th- 1797
With reluctance I write to thee this time and
can hardly expects any relief from thee after all thou has done
for me, yesterday Jno. Carty that liv'd with me some time
back obtain'd a Decree against me and put me in the Gaol
the sum is Â£4-7s besides the cost now Will be one Guinea more
though I write to thee I do not expect thou can be of any use
to me but per adventure I write, if opportunity serves send
me an old Coat if thou can, at present I have no prospect
of getting out my wife apply'd to my sister Harper
and its not likely she will do any thing for me so I
dont know how I'll get out fare well Jno. Leadbeater
