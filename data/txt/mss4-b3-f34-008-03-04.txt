Ballitore: 3/10 month 1790


My dear friend, 
        I know whether I told thee that I was obliged to thee for thy letter to Youghall  I am glad thus to hold a place in thy remembrance  & I hope & trust that the cementing virtue of Truth, which many years ago united some of us, who are now pretty far advanced in life, is still operating according to its [sic] own nature, drawing the children of the one family, whether alike or differing in age, into a lively fellowship, & union of spirit. That time I well remember was a time of love  & this time I feel to be the same. Indeed I think I feel an increase of it, both to individuals, & the family at large. And I rejoice in spirit at thy increase in devotedness, & willingness to become yet more vile. Thy honest, simple stepping forth with thy worthy companion, & in the depth of humiliation following thy Guide into the waste, dismal, gloomy spots, which are to be met with up & down, as well as exposing thyself to the censure of the rich and full, who seem as though planted in the wilderness, in a dry & thirsty ground, I say thy faithfulness and dedication herein I believe is acceptable in the sight of the great Lord of the harvest, & will tend to the confirmation of thy peace, & to the enlargement of thy coast, thy field of labour. Salute me also to thy dear companion  may she meet with best encouragement [page number] 134 and renewed ability to persevere in the honest discharge of thy ^her^ duty to the end of her exemplary, well-spent life!
        ++++++++++
        Farewell, my beloved friend,  & when inclination prompts thee to commune with me in this way, say not, Go, & come again, & to-morrow I will give; when thou hast it by thee.
        I am, with frequent, solicitous & renewed desires for thy welfare and preservation, & increase in all Good,
        very affectionately thine
                Richard Shackleton
