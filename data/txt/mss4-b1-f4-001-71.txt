are our duties. Much severer trials may yet await us, than the
translation of the spirit of an innocent child, from a scene
of conflict and danger, to everlasting safety and happiness.
I think thou art quite right in paying all proper attention
to the facilitating thy husband is leaving home, and getting the
benefit of solemn feasts, as well as thyself. Those who are
often much hampered with worldly cares, are necessarily covered
233
with the dust of them. They want to be often shaken from the dust,
that it may not lie so long as to sully their garments Turning the
back to the world for a season, and giving up to those solemnities,
I believe, are often attended with beneficial consequences. The women
dwell more ex officio, in the quiet habitation - are less
exposed to the spots of the world. *** I am glad to be well
assured that thy husband and thou earnestly seek each other's
improvement in the best things, and are as desirous each for the opportunity
of the others spiritual advantage, as his or her own.
