Respect & gratitude demand
The [deletion]exertions[/deletion] [insertion]tribute[/insertion] of my head & hand
And if my generous Patron's smile
Approves - rewards mine humble toil
What pride, what pleasure to my heart
Shall that benignant smile impart
And while unutter'd feelings swell
My bosom, there the thought shall dwell
Which prompts my efforts to excel.
