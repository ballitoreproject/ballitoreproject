Moone 13th of 8th mo 1829
My dearest Sarah
We were as thou may well suppose,
much troubled on hearing of Nezer's illness, but hope
that it may be something of the nature of the attack
little Johnny had in Ballitore when teething. I have
been intending to go to you next week, but waited for
a companion. Eben talked of sending the car on early
a companion. Eben talked of sending the care on early
to give the horse time to rest & bringing me as
to give the house time to rest & bringing me as
far as Naas in the gig, which if Edward would meet
him & come down (while I would go to thee) he
would fix on 7th day which would give time
for answer, which I know must depend
on the state of the child.
farewell till I see thee
thine DS:

My dear Sarah I am exceedingly sorry to
hear dear little Eben has been so attacked,
I hope it is only caused by teething, remember
how Johnny was here, & how they
never returned, dear Sarah do let us
know how he continues.
Thy EL
