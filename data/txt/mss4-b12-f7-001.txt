Extempore by Margt. Shackleton on

Peculiar to our modern fair,
But Modesty will be display'd
In this little smiling maid.

Mea pictura non est similis mihi. Illa[deletion]t[/deletion]est
quidem imago tua, quia emebas cum, sed non est
imago tui, est venustior facie tua gradibus multis.
Desideriuim tuu[insertion]m[/insertion] mei est forti[deletion]an[/deletion][insertion]us[/insertion] desiderio meo tui;
tu amas me, quia sum retilis tibi; sedes indignus
amore meo, quia es inanis virtutis omnis
