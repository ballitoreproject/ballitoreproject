It will undoubtedly appear very strange to John St. Leger to receive
a Letter of this kind from a simple Woman, & perhaps will be a subject of
ridicule; but if thou knew what pass'd in my mind within these three days
about thee, I believe thou wou'd give some attention to it: I heard thou wert
very ill not like to be long in this life, I felt compassion & concern for
thee, & wou’d have been glad to be with thee at that time, that I might
endeavour, if it was possible, to persuade thee to seek thy own good at his hand
who created thee in his own Image for a purpose of his own Glory & thy
own happiness, gave thee strength of body, a rational understanding, a
suffeciency of the good things of this life for thy own support & the relief of
others, & above all favours, a Gift of his divine & saving Grace to instruct &
lead thee safely thro. Life, for the Apostle declares, "the Grace of God which
brings Salvation has appear’d unto all men, teaching us, that denying
Ungodliness & worldly Lusts we shou’d live soberly, righteously, & godly in this
present World. "Now I desire thou wilt examine thy own heart whether thou
hast turn'd from it into Wantonness, Excess & profaneness, not regarding
hast turn'd form it into Wantonness, Excess & profaneness, not regarding

the fear of the Allmighty, who is the dread of Nations, & to whom thou art under
so many & deep Obligations, who cou'd have cut the thread of thy life when in thy
full strength, if he pleas'd: yet has spar’d thee in mercy to see if thou wou'd return to
him: And now perhaps the Abuse which thy Constitution has got, may cause
Nature to fail, & thy Body to return to its Original Dust, when the part in thee
which is of eternal duration must appear before the impartial Judge of Quick &
Dead, there to receive a Reward according to the Deeds done in the Body: Therefore
I beseech thee as a Christian, as a fellow Creature, as one who has felt something
of the Terrors of this just Judge for Evil, that thou wilt lay aside all Intemperance.
Consider these things seriously, & humble thyself in the Sight of the great
Lord of Heaven & Earth, before whom things must bow, & the Potentates of
the Earth lay down their Crowns: that so thou might find Mercy with him
who willeth not the Death of him that dieth in Sin, but rather that all
shou'd return repent & live; which is manifest in the Expressions of the
Prophet, when personating the Allmighty he says, " Wash ye, make ye
Prophet, when personating the Allmighty he says, "Wash ye, make ye
clean, put away the evil of your doings from before mine Eyes, cease to
do evil, learn to do well: Seek Judgment, relieve the Oppress’d, Judge the
Fatherless, Plead for the Widdow, Come, let us reason together, saith the Lord;

tho. your sins be as Scarlet they shall be as white as snow; tho. they be
red as crimson, they shall be as Wool"
that leads to Destruction, yet it seems my Business to persuade thee not to
be discourag’d (by thinking thou cant find mercy) from turning to the Lord,
"who wou’d have mercy, & to our God, who wou'd abundantly pardon."
