(5?) May, 1833
I think it full time my dear Eliza to get a
letter from thee it is now a week but I suppose thou
art going to pay me in my own coin, I think thou can
not have put it off longer than today however and I
need not yet despair as it is not yet over. the thing of
greatest importance I have to tell thee is that the big
house is let to the [unclear]Sunells[/unclear] my Mother was in town
yesterday and concluded the bargain, one hundred
guineas and half the gardiners, they wish for it as soon
as we can give it, so I suppose next week we will be
as busy as can be, I am very glad thou art out of
the way of all the bustle, I hope thou art now quite
well of that little attack thou had since Cousin Betsy
came. She has been very poorly all the week I saw
her yesterday in bed, she seemed heavy and said she
had not been so ill these forty years [deletion]when[/deletion] and then
she had had a fever, it is a curious complaint some
it attacks lightly and some very heavily, our people
seemed to have escaped finely, Frank's cold being
nearly gone, My Aunt Fayle has had it and been obliged
to be in bed for two or three days Sally also had it
but not confined to bed. in fact there is scarcely any
one has escaped it. I have very little news to tell

thee of the meeting. I have been in town since second
day & did not like leaving my Mother for so long, but
she wished me to stay in, she did not [insertion]want[/insertion] me she said as
Arthur has been out most of the week and Lucy seemed
to think I might stay in so I staid. I expect my Mother
will be in tomorrow & then I will return with her, she
desired me to tell thee she did not wish thee home
untill she wrote for thee so keep quiet, I told Cousin
Betsy so yesterday. It is fixed that Frederic is to sleep
at Dominick street, I think we will [insertion]miss[/insertion] Mary street greatly
I am sure I wish all our settling and moving was over
but that seems as [insertion]if[/insertion] it never would be the case.
Josiah & Debh. drank tea here one evening this week
Debh. is a nice little woman she is so free and agreeable
Jos [underline]might[/underline] be a little more thawed. they do not lodge
at my Aunts but at F Webbs. my Aunt has Ellen Haughton
who I suppose will be laid up as usual. I have
seen very few strangers this meeting scarcely being out
at all except at meeting, it was over last evening the
parting meeting to be tomorrow. F W has got the influenza
I suppose it is it he has. I have not heard to day
how he is but I hope I shall, and that I will be able to
tell thee particularly how he is. I believe I told thee
in my last that Joseph Jacob was in town he was asking for
thee. his wife was prevented coming by the illness of their
child, Mary he says is a good deal better. Jane Calvert
was also enquiring particularly for thee, she is as nice

as ever and looks as pleasant as usual. I dont know who
is the belle of this meeting, I think Louisa Greer the finest
girl I saw but women thou knows are no judge of each
others perfections. I was invited to Saml Bewleys one
day and guess how many were there only [underline]fifty seven[/underline]
but I was not one of them I am sure I am glad I
did not go; a great many of them had to stand there not
being seats, untill dinner was ready when they got forms
thou did not say how thou liked H Bewley's wife
she is certainly not very prepossessing looking but I suppose
makes up for that in agreeability, I understand she thinks
the Irish very rude, and made some remark
to some one about their staring at her, and the
answer she got was "[underline]well one look was sufficient[/underline]",
I cannot vouch for the truth of it
indeed I think it was scarcely said to herself for no
one would be likely to give so severe an answer. I have
just been to see FW - who complains greatly of his
head, Dr Henry has been to see him and ordered
him something, he is confined to bed, poor fellow his
spirits are very much depressed, and have been this
some time, He said he had a letter from thee about a
week since and that he never could get to answer it,
I saw Sam there who [deletion]never[/deletion] seems to think it is the influenza.
I hope it may be so and that it wont signify.
Lucy desires her dear love to thee and says there is no
use in her writing as she supposes I have told thee
all the news, and I am sure it is but little I have told
or had to tell. Frank also joins in love and accept a share from
thy affecte. sister Selina

Richard & Elizabeth are to begin their moving on second
day I believe as they must leave the house empty [unclear]on[/unclear]
the eighth Jane Stephens is with them. Frederic's things
were sent yesterday to John's. I dont know whether or
not we are to dine at Britain street tomorrow. Lucy
and I are going to take a little walk so I must conclude.
We had a bachelor here this morning to breakfast
Saml. Dudley - on going away he made an apology for leaving
us so soon. where as Frank said he thought he never would
go. He had a good deal of chat, but did not look to advantage
as he has got [underline]the cold[/underline].
