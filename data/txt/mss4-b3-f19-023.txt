Waterford Twelfthmonth 1st 1790


Dear Uncle


        At the request of a James Cassidy of Great Placentia Newfoundland to our GP, I have to trouble thee to have inquiry made for his mother Dorothy Cassidy alias Byrne [?] of Crooks town, who he mentions to have been formerly a Servant of thine, & pay her a Guinea, which he has sent here for that purpose: I can re-imburse thee at some future opportunity; perhaps I may find my way to Ballitore soon, as I have got the Accounts in greater forwardness than they were ever since I came to Waterford.There is at present no prospect of Frank being sent to your School, as his mother is prepossessed against your Assistant Dennis Noonan, whom she had an opportunity of knowing here; as he attended her children in capacity of a private tutor.
        I hope the School is in a flourishing state; & that Cousin Abraham will not suffer by any competition in the new branch of business he is about to embark inTis said that others in Ballitore are to follow his example in erecting mills. What a change! for the once peaceful village to converted into a bustling resort for busy faces. I suppose the vicinity of the Grand Canal is the inducement to those adventurersNow I am on the subject of mills I may inform thee that James Daniell has taken Mayfield Mills, a pleasant situation up the river about 7 miles distance from hence. It will be well if the country afford gust [?] enough to keep them all going [sic]
        I hope thou, my aunt & the rest of the family enjoy good health, & that Cousin Abrahams children are quite recovered. I suppose Sally is still in Clonmel with her sister: the last account I heard from thence was favourableAnne Penrose has added a son to Williams family who & the mother are likely to do well
        Please present me affectionately to all at home & to Cousins T&D Chandlee when opportunity serves & believe me to be
        thy dutiful nephew
        William Rayner
