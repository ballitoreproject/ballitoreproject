11th- mo 1827
My dear E- dont blame me about the china when I found
that the large basket wd not hold all I had the other
sent there that night & there it lay till I came
to town & went to Dawson street to rummage it out
they seem'd rather ashamed of themselves I hope
the Coachman brou[insertion]g[/insertion]t it to thee his niece said
he would that basket is to be return'd when thine will
be given up instead I wish thou wd make a
little bill of all I owe just for myself I send
some towels & 1/3 postage which I ow also[insertion] 1 1/2d[/insertion]
we are at home again & will soon be
settled, Did thou get the striking for Johnny
and the Coffee Mill for Deb, I write in haste
as Ed goes by to night Coach I wish i
could see thee here.
