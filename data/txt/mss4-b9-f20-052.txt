My dear Elizth
2nd of 1829
Jane W call'd to'day [unclear]& gave[/unclear] me some account of thee
& thine also of Ballitore in general which I was glad
to hear as I have heard very little of late of you, except the
good news of Deborah's improved health, poor Magt. seems
to mend tho' very slowly which I believe is safer than
if she recover'd more rapidly as it keeps us on our guard
as to giving her food or letting her talk too much she is
rather inclined to exceed the moderate bounds in both
cares. I have sent to S Wright for the calico I hope
it is not lost, we have moved magt. into the room
next ours up stairs which we have defended from a
cold blast by a screen so that we hope to guard her from
a cough, she has a light cough which we hope to
remove by keeping her from [deletion]draughts[/deletion] [insertion]the cold[/insertion] [deletion]of[/deletion] air, she sits
up for a little while each day in the lazy chair, which
pleases her greatly she also sits a good deal in her little
bed playing with her babies &c, she looks very old-
fashion'd she was asleep when her parcel arrived & has
not yet waken'd when wilt thou be done [unclear]kindly[/unclear] for her
I long to see my poor Willy
