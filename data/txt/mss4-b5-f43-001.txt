Mrs. Leadbeater,
I have recd. your Note, and return you and
the Master my sincere thanks for the many Obligations I have
been under in being so troublesome to you in calling for (rep
answering) trifles on my Acct. which I fear is the cause of your
not having the Children taught. I should feel myself
extremely Sorry in giving the least cause to incur any
persons displeasure, particularly a family for whom I always
had very great esteem - as to the Tuition of the Children,
I am conscious of having endeavour'd (as I should) to forward
them in the best manner I could, & I felt regret if at any-
time I found them inattentive, or unwilling to do as much
as I wished they should, there is no family I could attend
with more pleasure, nor shall shall when convenient to you.
you'se please to remember that there is nine visits unsettled
for, that is every day [deletion]before[/deletion] the week before last except the
seventh, and last week except the fourth and seventh.
I am with due regard Madam
your friend & well wisher Thomas Doyle

Mrs. Leadbeater
