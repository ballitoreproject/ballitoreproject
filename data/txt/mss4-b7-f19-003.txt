My Dear Molly
Having now got a little sperits to write, after
receiving thy sympathysing letter; which I think
requires my notice, for nothing at this time cou'd
give me more satisfaction, than a line from my Dr..
friend: & cou'd I have [insertion]had[/insertion] company, when in my
Affliction, I thought it wou'd have affoarded me
some relief, tho to be sure every one must bear their
oun troubles; in which throw mercy we have[deletion]ing[/deletion]
been wonderfully supported; & I hope will to the end
considering we have had, so great a loss, a loss my
Dr.. Molly, which can never be repaird & which we
have reason ever to regret; may thee my Dr.. never
witness, what I have seen & undergone, this some
months past, oh! my Dr what a malencholy scene
it was, to see a tender Parent, pining under a
pain[deletion][/deletion]full sickness; for so long a time, & his three
latter days, was deprived of speech, only in great
Pain nor did he eat one bit: this relation goes
two near my afflicted heart, well my Dr.. we
have a secret hope, that all his sufferings was in
this troublesome world, & I hope is tryumpling now
in that which is everlasting, & full of grory: may
his kind exertations, & his Dr.. Image, be ever before
my view; I am sensable, we are all born to troubles
& are all to have a share, either more or less, sooner
or laiter; I must endeavour to quite a subject
so near to me, my Mother, is as well as can be
expected & so are we all, except my Brother, Tom:

who is complaining a little, which I believe is occassioned
by cold; E. Pike & C Beale, arrived from month:rath
meeting yesterday, & since that Joseph Pike,
has being confind to his bed: while he was out in town
about business, he took a disiness or lightness in his
hear; to day the sent for a Dockter, which ordered
him to be bled, at present the are in hopes it will
go off, as he has no other complaint, but the Dockter
advises him to lie; which I hope will restore him;
ah! my Dr.. what a loss would such a man be, both
to his family & the publick.
my Mothers love, & Sisters joyns mine
to all your Family & all friends & I hope
my Dr Molly, allways to remember thy friendship

& good nature, to me at this time & at all others
which I have experienced, & conclude thy Loving friend
