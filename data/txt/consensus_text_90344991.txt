11th march
11th moth.
[extra line]
Philip went to [unclear]out[/unclear] soon after
tea and here am I all alone
by myself just thinking of
adjourning to my chamber -
The rains I think had ceased &
it seems [unclear] to be blowing pretty strong
so perhaps we are near fine wea[unclear][/unclear]
12th alas! I am mistaken for [unclear]again[/unclear]
this morning there is nothing
but rain rain rain - a dreary
prospect. I was determined
I would make use of the day
and get several odd jobs done
which I had on hands - Poor
Philip does not seem much
better - he has gone to bed long
ago -, and here am I all alone
again by myself - waiting for
them to come out - I am afraid
in vain for it is such a pouring
wet night I am greatly afraid
each night I am greatly afraid
[extra line] I am greatly afraid
[extra line]
they will wait till to-morrow
oh! I hope they will come -
