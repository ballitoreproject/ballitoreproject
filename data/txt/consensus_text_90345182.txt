the day away mostly with Lucy
Go[insertion]ff[/insertion][deletion]ugh[/deletion] who is a great friend of hers
and in town at present.
29th A wet gloomy day - Polly & I went
out notwithstanding for a while before
dinner - Papa received a [deletion][unclear]lett[/unclear][/deletion] newspaper
from Melbourne, and as of course
we suppose it is from Ned, it was very
welcome indeed - Uncle James called
for a few minutes to tell us Aunt
Liddy could not come in & spend
the evening with us, as she had
hoped - for which we were very sorry
Papa went out to Fassaroe after tea.
30th. Papa, Margt. and Liddy came
in this morning - and soon
after Polly L & I went to [unclear]Glukmans[/unclear]
to get Polly's daguerreotype taken -
After dinner we went out again,
to see about getting our fur cloaks
Elizabeth and Jane were in town
to day and Ellen also called -.
