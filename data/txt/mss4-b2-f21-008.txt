Dear Friend, I Left home Some days agoe principaly to Settle in Company with the rest of our deceasd friend John[?] Hancocks 4 Months / This looks &c, and came here yesterday Evening to see my Brother Bradshaws familie, but in particular Cousin James, who I had been informd was Wasting very fast, I got here about 6 oClock, just in time Spake to Jimmy, and stay by him in his last moments, he was Sencible and Spoke affectionately to me about half past 7, and a Little after Eight last night he departed this uncertain life, for, I trust one more Glorious as I had a Little time on hand this Evening, Tho am persuaded the Tidings will give concern to Thee & Betty & in particular as it must awaken sympathy With his Parents, but more Espeshaly his afflicted mother I concluded to Write Thee a few Lines to acquaint thee thereof, not doubting but thoul brake the matter prudently to Bob;
As I Expect to see thee soon, perhaps its not material now to tell Thee how I fare, nor indeed is it an Easy matter to give a discription thereof, my journey Through this Life I move and move see is to be a path of deficulties and many besetments, sometimes I am favored with strenght to Climb as on hands & Knees to such places of Prospect, that I think I see Glimpses of the better Country, but at same time I see it out do for me to fall asleep on these Assents; but that much of the path is yet before me if I attain the desired Haven, this leads to fresh Thoughtfullness requires new resolution, and renewed dedication of Heart, fresh besetments attend, between assent & assent, fear on one hand, danger on the other, deficulties before, and darkness if I look backward, the Small glimer of Light I find by Experiance, is the best guide and that it has never yet deceived me; but then faith at times appears at a distance, had I (some times think) this Invincible Shield allways, upon me, I would be able to combat with Wild beasts, Remove mountains, & Quench the Voilance of strange fire, at other times I see its necessary I should Know a being stripd as well as Cloathed that I may Ever Retain in Rememberance Whose is the Robes, as well as the Horse, to Continue Humble Sup^p^liants in the days assignd for Humiliation, is certainly Profitable, here we Receive dayly bread, & that, Such as is most profitable for us, tho sometimes, that of bitter herbs I have Some times been redy to think, I had gained som Strenght; so as no more to be Reduced to so low a state as in times past; and some thing has been redy to Insinuate, there was no longer a necessity for it, the Idea of which, for a time as been pleasing; but by and then I have seen whose Language this was, and the Result has been, a Senceire desire of [crossed out] that my hands & heart might be afresh Washed in Pure Water by the Word; Finaly Dear friend I perceive of a Truth, that its not the who girds on the armour that has the least Right to boast, but he only who Indures to the End of the Afflicting Fight and with this mortal body lays it of
My Love to Thy Wife Father Mothers &c Allso to Cousin Bob: whom may Inform his Father and Brother Thomas are well; I am in a good dale of pain for my sister she looks very poorly, is much Reduced as to flesh; has Little apetite, and a Very hard cough,  I begin to fear the Consequence if she dont get a Turn for the better very Soon 
Thou Some times used to Write me & Some times Thy Wife favourd me with a few Lines; dont Let the Expence of Postage cut of our corrispondence
I Write This in Company of Many friends & others in Conversation, take it as it is, & believe me Amongst the Number of Those who Wishes Thy Increase in strength & Stability, and am Senceirely Thine
