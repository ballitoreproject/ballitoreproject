Limerick 4th Month 25th 1787
It was comfortable to find by my dear Marys accepble
letter that I was thought of by my friends, altho' I feel myself
unworthy of that as well as other favours. - In reply to
your kind enquiry after this family & me - may inform, that
we have been enabled to bear [underline]our recent & great loss[/underline] far beyond
what coud be expected - yet it is an event that will at
times be felt to the last period of Life - no Child ever loved
a Parent better than I did him who indeed merritted it from
me, & had it pleased Providence to remove him, before I had
another Object of tender affection to look to - I know not
how I might have borne it - But amidst my sorrow the
sence of this great favour, (not only on my own acct: but his
who used often to say were he spared to see it accomplished
he coud then lay down his head in peace) called for gratitude,
& the fear of Offending - the fear of this dear substitute being
also taken if I did - restrained my grief - & I have great
cause to be thankful, as well as to mourn the absence
of one of the tenderest & best of Parents whose greatest
Joy in Life was to see the Prosperity of his Children,
& whose consolation in Death, is I trust the being removed

from a World of Uncertainty & trouble - to one of Endless happiness
& peace - Where O! may we be enabled to Live [insertion]here[/insertion] so as to follow
him thither when our times comes - is at times the fervant
breathing of my Spirit. - I shall refer thee to my dear
Joseph who intends with Wm MccAllister & cosn. T. Taverner
for the ensuing Meeting of Dublin - for further perticulars
concerning the dear deceased &c. - I expect some
(if not all) of them will call at Ballitore, & fetch me a
particular acct. of dear A Taverner whose continued indisposition
gives me concern - whom I often think on with
affection & whose [deletion]it woud be a[/deletion] company it woud be a
great gratification to me to partake of - I believe
she partook in our sorrow, & doubt not but we had
her Sympathy. - do break to her in as tender a
manner as thou canst, the removal of Arthur Murphy
who' departed at 2 O'clock on 7th day &appeared sensible to
the last - his remains were interred on 2d day Evening,
his complaint suppose you have been informed was a
consumption [deletion]in[/deletion] he bore this tedious illness with much
patience considering the Man - seemed perticularly fond of

his Wife during it, & made a [unclear][/unclear] in her favour (which is to
be opened this day) leaving herself & Wm. Odle Exrs Edwd. Hatten
& my Joseph, Trustees - I have not yet heard the purport of it,
[deletion]nor so[/deletion] he used to often say [deletion]in[/deletion] [insertion]during[/insertion] his illness that he never coud be
sufficiently thankful that he had Becky & that she was supported
so well to attend him - which she did very close - the
day he was removed, he said woud be the last, & frequently
looked at his watch (which hung to the curtains) when he
was unable to speak. - Please remember my love
affecly to dear Anna, to Ann Grubb, Thy Father & Brothers
family in which my dear Joseph joins - requesting thee
to accept a large Portion thyself from thy obliged
R Harvey
