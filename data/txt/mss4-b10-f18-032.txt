Dunmore [insertion]East[/insertion] Harbour
On board Norma 26th 58
My dear Mamma
I just write a line
to tell you that we are here
yet, and I think likely to be
so till after Sunday at least,
we made an attempt today
to sail for Cork, but found
such a [unclear]dreary[/unclear] sea, and the wind
direct against us that we thought
it better to turn back - Manliff
desires his love to you, and to

say that he is quite well, and
hopes you are the same way -
 we intend to leave this the
very first favourable change
in the wind - we often see
Huldah but she cannot bear
the sailing it makes her so
sick, also the children, little
[unclear]Anna[/unclear] has not been very well -
I must go on shore with
this to get it in the office
in time, so must say Farewell
with dear love to Lucy and
all. ever your much attachd
MJB -
