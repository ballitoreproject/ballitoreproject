London 9 September 1790


Dear Sir/


        The following is the copy of a Letter which I this day received from Mr Bolton
        The late Mr John Shackleton of Pasture house near Colne died possessed of a very considerable personal Estate and also a real Estate of the Value of near 400 per Annum.
        At the time of his Death in the Year 1788 he left a Wife & two Daughters the elder about 5 or 6 Years old. Having made his Will which was properly attested for passing Real Estates he gave his Estates in Yorkshire (which he acquired upon his Marriage) to her Heirs & assigns, in case of the Death of both his Daughters under Age without Issue.
        As to his own original Estates which had all been acquired by himself & his father and amount to near 300 per Annum he gave them in case of such Death of his Daughter [sic] without Issue, In trust for such one or more of his Relations of the name of Nutter & his or their Heirs and Assigns as should be nominated by his Wife by her last Will & Testament.
        The older Daughter died lately of a very violent infectious Disorder, which also immediately attacked the Mother & carried her off in a day or two, & then the other Daughter.
        Mrs Shackleton having made no appointment of the latter Estates, it is apprehended they will desend [sic] to Mr Shackleton Heir at Law.
        There is no Question as to the Personal Estate, which goes to the nearest of kin of the two Daughters, they having a Grandmother (their Mothers Mother living)


        I wrote You a few evenings since, with a copy of the advertizement [sic] as it appeared in the Gazette ^28 August^ which presume You have received safe.
        My Grandfather Jeremiah Shackleton coming from that Neighbourhood & my Grandmother from Clithero [sic] where I understand she was married from  My Father Roger Shackleton Educated likewise near the Spot at Skipton induces me to suppose that we are in some degree related to this family
I have no doubt but your goodness will trace back the pedigree & give me every Information in your power, or put me in a method how to attain it.
        My Grandmothers Name was Shiers & came as I before mentioned from Clithero, William Shiers purchased the Estate of the Clock House near Bradford. I only mention this, as I think it corroborates my opinion that Family coming from & residing on that Spot, I have at least some right to suppose that some part of our family has a claim
        Mary [word crossed out] ^is^ charmingly recovered & is likely to do well, who together with all our Family desire to be united in kind respects to You & Family & believe me to be
        Affectionately Yours
        Thomas Shackleton
