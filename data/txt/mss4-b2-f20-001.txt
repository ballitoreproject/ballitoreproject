From Richard Shackleton to  
Ballitore: 23/ 1 month 1763
Dear friend,

	I make no doubt but thou hast at times thought hardly of me on account of the correspondence being dropt between us, yet I believe it failed on thy side, though it is true my wife & thou have since exchanged a letter with each other: however that be, as I always thought & still think the correspondence of my good friends a favour done me, I have many times thought of endeavouring to revive that between us. And indeed I rather hope that such an intercourse between us would tend rather to good than any hurt, for I think a frequent conferring together, & the having a passage open & the way clear for a friendly & brotherly communication of sentiments & one anothers feelings, would be found of more general service, if more generally practised: whereas distance & shyness between friends is not good, & does no good: yet still charitable allowances are to be made for spiritual exercises, worldly business, constitution, habit & temper, which may any of them at times clog the wheels of a correspondence, where often inclination & disposition are not a wanting. Some of these causes may perhaps plead our excuse with each other. But the main thing worthy our chief recollection is, how we have spent the intermediate space of time, & what improvement & advancement we have been making in the work of religion for our own growth & preservation: & in a capacity to be helpful to others, & to promote the Lords cause in the earth, which can only be done by shewing forth his influence upon our minds by our lives & conversations among men, as well as by the same influence, publishing the doctrines & precepts of his gospel. For my part, when I consider the variety of religious professions that are in the world in general & that part of it called Christendom in particular, when I think that they all ert in this most essential branch of knowledge, & that even those who profess Christianity itself are quite out in laying the very first foundation of their building, & in learning the first rudiments of [word crossed out] ^true^ religion: and when I am led to believe that our fore-fathers in the last century were called (after as ^so^ many centuries passed in apostacy, error & superstition) to hold forth again in their lives & principles that most holy faith, even Christianity in its purity, which Christ Jesus taught to his immediate followers, & established on earth to remain to the end of the world; & when I ponder that we are the successors in the same faith of those dignified ancestors & illustrious sons of the morning of our day, & that the same cause is now committed to us to be maintained in the same spirit, & by the same power, I say, when these things are brought under my solid reflection, I am at times weighed down into the deeps under a sense of the awful station I am placed in by the wisdom of Providence, even to be a professor of this religion of Christ, so that I am ready to say, How dreadful is this place/ &c.
If then it is so awful a matter to profess this holy religion as a private member of society, how much more so must it be to be set apart as a chosen vessel to convey the quickening virtue of it to others? How great degrees of purity & holiness are requisite here, not only in a private capacity to be enabled to set an example of performing the will, but also in publick & private to declare the whole counsel of God. These have not only the temptations to grapple with, which are incident to all in general, but as they are of particular use in carrying on this glorious work, the grand opposure opposer of it plays his engines in a particular manner against them, & formed ^forms^ schemes deep laid in the mystery of inquity, that if he cannot utterly destroy their faith he may render them less useful than Infinite Wisdom intended; so rob them in some part of the weight of their present & future crown, & the church of the benefits which might acerne [?] from the perfection of the gifts & graces bestowed upon them. It is this enemys grand employment, dear friend, to be constantly endeavouring to defile this vessel, through which the divine intelligence is, at times, communicated to the people, & divine life conveyed, for there is no other excellence required in the instrument but that it be clear & clean. It seems to me [struck through] as though he had principally three ways by which he strives to effect this purpose. First, he would (if he could) entirely begrime the vessel, or pipe, so that none at all of this precious liquor should enter it, but [strike through] that which was once a vessel of honour should be laid aside as useful useless. Secondly, there is danger lest the vessel, though in a good measure clean, & free from filth of any kind, for want of being sufficiently imbued with the savour of the liquor passing often enough through it, should impregnate & adulterate the liquor with some quality inherent in, or accidental to the vessel itself. And lastly, the pipe may be polluted by the sediments of this same precious liquor, which should be entirely cleansed out, or will be like the manna gathered yesterday, & loathed by those, whose health, and appetite is good, & who can only be satisfied with wine well refined off the lees.
I doubt not, dear friend, but thou hast anticipated, in thy own knowledge & experience, any broken hints which I can effect on this subject, though I thus indulge an inclination of freely communicating my sentiments to thee I own I do above all things love this most noble cause, our holy religion, & I do believe that thou (among many others) hast been called & qualified to bear public testimony to it. I fear also that several, who have been thus called, have by one means or other been prevented from coming up in that degree of buoning & shining lustre which was intended, and so our poor Society has [strike through] missed of the benefit which it so greatly wants, of the full degree & measure of instrumental help designed it, to its very great & apparent loss. My hearts desire is that all of us, who are touched with a sense that these things are so, many diligently wait at the fountain-head of wisdom & strength, that we may, by fresh supplies from thence, be enabled to come up nobly in the stations severally allotted to us; neither going before, nor staying behind our proper ranks; not going forth in the arms or habit of another, nor in the presumption of strength aforetime experienced, but which ^with^ the effectual, though to ourselves & others seemingly slight & contempteble weapons, which for the time being it shall please Divine wisdom to furnish us with. So shall the Lords strength be made perfect in our weakness, our own souls comforted & encouraged to go on, trusting in the sufficiency of every present supply, & the Church ^be^ edified by successful labour.
I commit us both, my dear friend, to Him who alone can preserve us alive in the root, & in his own time make fruitful in the branches. I do very sincerely desire thy preservation, stability & advancement in thy own particular, & in a capacity to be more & more serviceable in the general, I am in love g ^true^ brotherly affection

thy faithful friend
Richard Shackleton
