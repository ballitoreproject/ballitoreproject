Only two of whom were very sick looking,
two gentlemen both in consumption I think.
Doctor Barter paid me a visit at half past
8 or about 9 - And examainned my back -
found that an indenture had been
made in one of the [insertion]little[/insertion] bones of back - but
wound up by telling me he thought he
would quite cure me - The Mistress
went home by the night train - I
felt lonely after her- am ordered a bath
8 Monday - [underline]Fine[/underline] - Took my bath
and quite enjoyed it - Hannah Pim
is extremely kind - indeed so are all
the friends - I will soon pick up
acquaintances - have a matrass brought
out and laid on a wooden seat in an
airy situation under a tree -
9 Tuesday - [deletion]Bath[/deletion] - Breakfast, bath -
dinner and Tea - are the principal
performances during each day - I was
partly expecting Margt but she did not
come - Who appears but [underline]Mr Carden[/underline][underline][/underline]!!!
10 Wednesday - Margt came to day -
it is very pleasant to have her-
[underline]August 1859 -[/underline]
Mr Barter
has gone
for a week
[underline]every day[/underline]
