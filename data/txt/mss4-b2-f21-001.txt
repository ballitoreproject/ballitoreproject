Dear Richard, I would not have thee Entertain an Opinion that I have resolved against corresponding with Thee, no, for I have not, but on the contrary could with much freedom Write to Thee, and that frequently, were it the pleasure, of the, Great Kay of David, is to open the Everlasting Store house and thereout give me to cumunicate some what, that might be satisfactory, but from an apprehention that it Has pleasd Infinate Wisdom (for sometime past) to Withdraw in this (and in great Measure) other Respects, I have According to my small Experience in Christain Progress, Ever found it Safer to lay still, than let to work and by the strenght of Human skill Endever to force a passage when neither Wind or Tyde favourd, However there is a Recomendation in the proceedings of our last National meeting which I have more than once thought of and which I had thoughts of mentioning sometime soon, to Thee Which I think I find freedom now to do, its Recomended to the Three provinces to preveal upon Some Sutable young men to go over, with Others, as Representatives to next yearly meeting at London, now I confess the word (young) as Stuck a little with me, & I think I have never thought upon it but Thou & Thomas Wily of Cork, Came into my view, I would not choise to say much upon it at present, but just leave it to Thee, to Degest, its True I several times thought when Viewing over in my mind the present condition of the Church in this nation (so far as has occurd to my observation from the Knowledge I have of it) there seemd to me to need for such of the Youth as have been Visited & a Willingness begot in, to Inlist themselves, & have so done, I and has Received the Kings Bounty, and has been calld to Duty, and find the Weight of matters comeing & Settleing upon their Shoulders, I and finds their Hands Tied to the Testimoney, and the Law Spread before them, I say I think the Times Calls upon such to Exert themselves in the might and Wisdom, that is from aboves and in it go forward, following their Captain who leads his forth and goes before them &c,
