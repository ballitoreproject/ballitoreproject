My dear Lucy
As there may be
a chance of an opportunity tomorrow
I just take my pen
to tell thee I was much gratified
by thy note, I am glad
to hear you are all getting
on so well as Frank told us
and now thou hast got a right
hand woman thou wilt do
valiantly. Eliza is going to
town to day to stay for a few
days perhaps they may as
usual be lengthened into many.
I have not been out since except

to meeting we paid a
visit at the Parade where they
were finely and were asking
for thee, afterwards called to
Dalkey and sat there. I will
not say a very short time they
were most particular in their
inquiries about Mrs Malone
and were as kind & as cordial
as ever. Miss Gaston & Bessy
were here yesterday they came
over in the little gig drawn
by Jenny. Bessy has not yet got
the honey though I am persuading
her to do so. Mr Thomas
is in Banbridge and they told
us yesterday they were afraid
he was laid up with a swelled
face, how very interesting poor
fellow I will not laugh at him
for I have rather a regard for him
tho I fear it is not mutual,
I think I could scarce give my
consent to Eliza's marrying a
man who has [underline]nine children[/underline]
if that is the number which
Mr Dickson has got so we will
let that speculation end in a
bottle of smoke, J & [unclear]Mace[/unclear] to
spend their three holidays at
Christmas here, Edward & Richd
have been asked, but whether
they will honour us or not
cant tell, I am glad thou
liked the little frocks for Regy

I suppose you are very busy and I need scarcely
expect to hear from thee untill the hurry
is over but when it is and that there is an
inclination to do so I would like to hear from
thee. tell Frank with my love that he must
not disappoint [underline]me[/underline]. I have no news to enliven
my epistle so dont blame me if it is dull &
heavy for I am very much so myself after
the stupid wet weather we have had with
dear love to thyself & Frank believe me thy affecte.
Selina

I did not tell thee I had a very great
job mending the Music books & putting
new coats on them they are nearly finished
please send me the bill of the calico
I have not made it yet but hope soon
to do.
