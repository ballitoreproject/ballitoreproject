4th.. Sunday - We did not go to meeting
which was my fault - the morning
was a miserably unpleasant one to
me - but it brightened just before
dinner. After it we sat round the
fires and had coffee and after
tea we had quite a sociable little
party round it - There are two
new comers a father and son
who seem to be from Scotland.
to judge from "Papa's" accent -
He and Mr Matterson had great
talk about clergymen &c &c of various
descriptions. Mr [underline]Scriven[/underline] and Mrs
Studdart were there when I left also
