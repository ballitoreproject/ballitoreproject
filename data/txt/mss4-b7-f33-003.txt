I shou'd have answer'd my dear girls
letters before this some way or other but for sore eyes
I had for near two weeks & a sore mind tossed as if I
were on the mighty ocean now surely a mind in such
a situation can produce nothing that can be profitable.
only crave the sympathy sympathy of their friends
even of those that can feel & sympathize with such
apoor creature I realy have been in such away that
words cou'd not set forth nor a pen describe to the full
but he knows that knows the secrets of all hearts &
knows the sincerity & integrity of all our minds, the time
seems drawing nigh when I believe there will be a seperation
from this land oh the awfulness of the prospect is
enough to sink one if possible lower than apit, it has
often appeard wonderfull to me that the Almighty shou'd
[unclear]m[/unclear]ake use of such a creature as I if it be he that is making
mind I wou'd desire to be affect. remembered to all your family but as they
wont know of this I expect it might make a discovery
I may now say farewell my belo[unclear]ved F[/unclear]riends I remain your sincerely affect. poor

use of me & this sometimes seemes a doubtful case and
oh how I dread a delusion but this much I may say it is
an exceeding hard task to make a total surrender of all &
much more so when I consider my family is poor in [unclear]Inanassth[/unclear]
& I the least in the fathers house if I am but one of the
right family this is all I look for all I desire or seek after
but the cry of my poor mind is if his presence goes not with
me oh that he may not send me hence
but how came I to write after this manner to Children of
the first family of the first rank in church gov[unclear][/unclear]
I hear abundance atalk & much more than is agreable about
gover[deletion]n[/deletion]ment & regency about the kings son but not a word about
the kings daughter that we read was Glorious within
I sometimes think in my passing from place to place there is
so much talk about this outward goverment that it rather dims
and obstructs thy inward governer even the prince of peace that
this glory wou'd be within more, if outward things was less attended
too I dont mention this as hinting at any particular but

I sometimes think I hear more of it than is agreable to myself but to be sure
I have not a taste for those things you know my ignorance so well that I need not
tell you but you may say as the poor pilgrim said well Ignorance wilt thou be
ignorant still you know that paper will take any thing & I hope as soon as you
read this you will burn it & let no one see it for I have not wrote a word to any
one or told in such plain terms to mortal besids my Dear Companion nor do
I think it is worth paying postage for because as I said I am in such a situation
as not to be fit to write to anyone only I thought I wou'd just acknowledge
the receipt of your agreable lines as it will be always agreable to me to hear
from you is poor sally Haughton still spining out the tread of life wonderful
how long she continues please remember me affect. to her & her sister that will be
apoor lone creature but there is a Comforter in the most needful pinching time
"apoor lone creature but there is a Comforter in the most needful pinching time
may she be favour'd to feel him near to support her is the sincere desire of my
mind I wou'd desire to be affect. remembered to all your family but as they
wont know of this I expect it might make a discovery
I may now say farewell my belo[unclear]ved f[/unclear]riends I remain your sincerely affect. poor
