Fassaroe 5th of 4th Mo. 1847
2nd day morning
My dear Eliza
I wrote to thee on the 19th ult. & again on the 26th,
for Arthur to enclose in his letter to Thomas. Thy mother
contributed her mite also, & I believe Florence & Emy,
so that, by this time thou must be in possession of those
dispatches, & perhaps several others, which, with the one
exception, contain good accounts from home.
Thy two letters from Dresden are now in my pocket,
& that of the 24th & 26th ult. was read here yesterday
morning by Richard, who came [deletion]here[/deletion] from Glendruid to
breakfast. He said it was received the day before.
When you got to your journeys and before your [underline]own[/underline]
letters announcing your intention of going [insertion]there[/insertion] it was no
wonder I appeared tardy in writing, & that thou looked
long and anxiously for news from thy native Country.
Thomas was right in saying there could not be one so soon
unless I wrote almost immediately after your departure.
You really got on most rapidly & must have enjoyed
your pleasant company highly. I was glad to find
you did not lose your muffling, which was a valuable
parcel. I saw it made up, & noticed Thomas's plain
direction on the strap of the apron, & thought if it went
astray & fell into the hands of honest people, they might
easily find the owner.
When I was on the Continent first, I saw more to interest
of a novel character in Holland than Germany -

In my last note I mentioned poor Dickeys increasing delicacy
& that I was here taking care of him for the present, [deletion]&[/deletion]
thou wilt see by the date of this that I am still at my post as nurse,
not feeling easy to relinquish it, untill I see some amendment
in my patient, or, till some one else takes my place. - I am
sorry to have been obliged to leave thy mother at this juncture,
but as my services appeared to be required here, &
she after her best fashion, ventured to come, knowing she
was [underline]not alone[/underline] & that I could go to her on very short notice
if necessary, She herself thought I ought to come.
The weakness that I alluded to Dr. Moss said, was more
apparent than real, & that the inability to move was
caused by the stiffness of the joints, from the tendency to Dropsy.
If the swelling continues, [insertion]or increases[/insertion] he fears his breathing will be affected
as it was at the Commencement & if violent would
soon terminate his existence. As it is, he does not now
look forward to his ultimate recovery, & says all we can
do is to try & prolong life within the last few days he
has not lost ground, & we think has been relieved by [insertion]Blistering[/insertion] & applying
a few leeches near his heart twice. I also rub him
well night & morning & keep him very quiet. He does not
get up untill near two oClock, & then either sits in an
easy chair, or lies on a sofa, wrapt in a blanket & dressing
gown. His pulse varies from 98 to 110, & towards night 120,
sometimes but it is strong. The doctor thinks the heart,
is enlarging & that his lungs are sound.
Eliz. B. has got back to Ballitore much improved - A. & A. B. have
moved to Eustace St. & are busy getting the house cleaned & painted.
As I think this letter will be [insertion]more[/insertion] acceptable by a little addition
from others, I shall conclude with best love to Thomas & the girls
& remain thy affectionate sister E. R Barrington -
I intend calling to see thy mother this evening, on my way to Town & leaving this
with her. Mr. Malone is to be married the 7th. too -
4 oclock Dick really seems better this evening & the swelling has
subsided a good deal in his hands, so much so he was able to wash them
a while ago, without any assistance, & he also got out of bed with only
a little help from me instead of having one of the Boys or his Father
The weather has been very severe since I came here - first rain
for three days, & then frost & snow, enough to make every thing quite white.
I heard from M. Davis to day. Eliz. B. continues pretty
well since her return from Blarney, but Sally is threatened
with another sore leg. Charles is come home from school
& not likely to return there again He is a little indisposed but
Moss says his indisposition will not signify & only requires attention.
Ewd. has got a housekeeper in Britain St an elderly woman

Glendruid 5 of 4th month 1847.
My dear Aunt Eliza
Emily and I wrote to [deletion]tell[/deletion] thee last week.
but I will write again now as Mamma asked me. Emily is laid
up with a swelled jaw since 7th day, but she did not
stay in bed untill to day. Every body was saying yesterday
that we felt very lonesome without you. We had only
Aunt Martha, Uncle Fred, and Uncle Arthur in addition to
ourselves. Mamma came to tea here this evening on her way to town
in Uncle Edward's car. Grandmamma is [deletion]up[/deletion] up town with
Emily, Aunt Fayle knitting and I thinking what I shall say
to thee. I hope you will soon come back and tell us all the
news. I must stop as somebody else is to write I believe.
Farewell with to thy self and Uncle T. I am thy affectionate niece
H. Barrington.
My dear Eliza there were two letters sent
from this to you before this one which I hope you have got before this if not
I fear this is making thyself very uneasy it is not right to give way and fretting
for no purpose, I was at [unclear]Glengeary[/unclear] and I [unclear]Worry[/unclear] Mooney seems anxious to have
every thing right for you, the weather is so completly wet and cold that one
can get very little done either in the Garden or Fields, I have a Letter from
you written as soon as Bessy' wedding is over telling us all about it, Emily
is better and I hope to have her down stairs tomorrow with Love to Thomas
and the girls I am dear Eliza
thy Loving mother

Tell Bessy I wish her a happy marriage, and a prosperous
career, and many happy returns of her wedding
day as I dont know her birth day, it [deletion]as[/deletion] is all one,
and the same which it is. I was glad to hear you
got your cloaks as I was interested in them when
I heard you lost them. Believe me your affec. Nephew
Richd. M Barrington.
My Dear Aunt. Here I am now in the armchair
in my own room, just after getting up. I think
I am getting stronger and in fact a little better. Aunt
Elizabeth is nursing me this great while, which
is the consequence of my improvement. She read
to me thy letters, which I enjoyed very much
