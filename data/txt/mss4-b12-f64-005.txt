Extract from Saunders's NewsLetter.
Paris, Febry. 10th 1791
A Diputation was received from the Society of Quakers, intreating
that they might be indulged in the uninterrupted exercise of
their religious principles; that the simple registry of their marriages,
births & deaths, might be considered as valid in Law, on a
declaration being made before a Magistrate; that they might
be absolved from all form of oath, & that the simple affirmation
shod. be deemed sufficient, as in England & the United
States of America; that they might not be constrained to
take the Civic oath, at the same time declaring, that they
would continue faithful to the established constitution, &
consenting to submit to the punishment of perjury,
should they be convicted of making judiciary depositions
contrary to the truth -
M. de Mirabeau, the President, in answer, among other
things, observed, that the intercourse of every man with the
Supreme Being is independent of every political institution -
"What Government, said he, shall dare to interpose between
"God & the heart of man?"
"Estimable Citizens! continued the President, you
have already taken the Civic oath, which every man worthy
"of being free considers rather as a pleasure than as a duty.
"You have not, indeed, taken God to witness, but you affirm
"according to your consciences - and is not a pure conscience
"the Temple of Divinity?"
The answer of Mirabeau was frequently interrupted by
the applauses bestowed upon it, &, together with the speech on
the part of the Quakers, was ordered to be printed -

Deputation of the Quakers
in France.
