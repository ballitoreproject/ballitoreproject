Dublin March 23rd 1829
My dear Elizabeth
As Sarah is still at the
Glen with Magt I think I may take it
upon myself to reply to that part of your
letter relative to a servant girl whom we
have here from Stradbally. I believe it
is Sarah's intention not to part with her
provided she is herself satisfied to stay
here. At least this was her determination
on Friday last. I think I heard Sarah
say that she spoke to her of going to
you as a thorough servant and that
she at once declined it. Your letter
by L Wright came safely. The little book
R Webb was printing is nearly finished.
Miss the receipt of your letter this
morning I called at [unclear]Crogans[/unclear] house
he is from home, but I learned that
Murray himself is in town and I
intend trying to see him before post
hour.

The secret to be mentioned before I close
this. With respect to the division of the Legacy
duty amongst the Legatees, it seems to
me that you might fairly divide
it amongst them as follows -
Elizabeth _____ 6.. 6. 8
7 . 6 . 8
Lydia _____ 6 _ 6 _ 8
[underline] 2 .. 6 [/underline]
Deborah ____ 2 _ 10 ____
4 .. 2
Lonah _____ 6 _ 6 _ 8
Sarah --------- 6- 6- 8
Richard none
£ 21 . 10 - 0 Total Amt paid
The value of three of the bequests as
far as I can estimate nearly equal
and the value charged to Debh bears
the same proportion to £21..10s--0d that
her share of the property bears to the
entire. The fee to Notary ought to be
charged by you to the estate generally
like any other expense attending it.
take out [unclear]orloss[/unclear]
I have just returned after a fruitless attempt
to see Murray however I expect to see him
before he leaves town and inform you

accordingly I remain
yours affectionately

Maggie still looks and is delicate
