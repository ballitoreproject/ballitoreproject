after a short interval there is some
bustle outside and at the Platform door
and presently in walks the President
and his Excellency the Lord [unclear]Lieutenant[/unclear]
accompanied by numerous aid de camps
and two young ladies the hon miss
Lascelles. Of course there was great
clapping [unclear]P.P.P.[/unclear] and at last Doctor
clapping &c &c &c and at last Doctor
Lloyd addressed the [unclear]assembled[/unclear] company
it was a long and learned [unclear]address[/unclear]
indeed and I fear rather beyond the
comprehension of many. When he
had finished it and sat down amidst us[/unclear]
great applause [insertion]The lord lieutenant spoke at some length[/insertion]many many little speeches on
different topics relating to the Association
some made and Roberson Philips read
were made and Professor Philips read
[insertion]us[/insertion] some account of the financial department
which seemed to be in a flourishing
condition. I think he also stated
that more than 1500 tickets had been
[insertion]already[/insertion] issued for this meeting and they
expected more - and gave L some
information respecting the arrangements
