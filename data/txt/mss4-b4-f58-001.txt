My dear Sarah/
Allow me to commit these
Notices & memoirs concerning
Henry Grattan to thy care:
Thou wilt find them worth
perusing: but let not little
Johnny get a grip of them.
When thou hast read them,
thou will oblige me by enclosing
them to Fanny Grattan
York St: Doctor Henry would
have them safely delivered
if left at 15 College Green
at some time please to
convey my thanks to Fanny
for the pleasure I have had

in seeing such beautiful
relicks preserved and accompanied
by so honourable
a testimony
I was at the Carlow meeting
where I got cold or
something that put me out.
something that put me out,
not having been able to
bathe while there.
I had very little of Edwd's
company at all- but I
suppose twas my own fault
thine very affectionately
Richd Shackleton
Love to all from mistress to maid.
