Pat Brady to James Costello
Dear James,
I hope you do not think me ill ill-natured for not having let
you hear from me for long a time. When I wrote last you know I was
going a journey by my myself without my father's company & help, &
my mind was so tossed that I could only send letters home to let
them know how I was getting on. But I believe a day never past, but
I thought of you, dear James, your good father & mother, & the dear children
& remembered the kindness shewn to me by every one of you. I wanted to
have something pleasant to tell you, & I could not be sure of it till I
came home. You know I mean the wish I had to gain Rose Bran for a
wife & I was in great dread about that. I was afraid I had not made enough
of money to undertake housekeeping, I was afraid too that if I had what
I [deletion]meet[/deletion] wished for more than any thing else in this world, I might
grow conceited, & careless how I behaved myself - & sure I dreaded that if
I had ever so much money & was ever so steady that may be
Rose would not take me, for I could never find out whether she liked
me or no as a companion In life, tho' I knew she [deletion]regarded me[/deletion] [insertion]had good with, to me[/insertion] as a
friend & neighbour. Those thoughts filled my mind, & I wondered how
little delight I took in looking at curious places, compared to what
I used when I had my father with me, to bear the burden of the business
& to case my mind when he saw I was fretting, I will not, tell you of my
lonesome journies, & the sorrowful thoughts I had, though I strove to put
them from me, to [deletion]mind my[/deletion] act fairly & honestly, & to hope for a
blessing on my endeavours, It was hard to be resigned to a desappointment
from Rose, but I strove In that too When I got home
several of the neighbours asked me if I had been sick I looked so badly
& wondered when I told them I was never better in my health.
When my father had examined into my profits, & made a little division
with me of his own; he came with me to Rose's father & made the proposal
of marriage. The old man left the matter entirely to his girl he
said - she had been a good daughter to him, & good to all the family &
he would have a sore miss of her, but would not stand in the way
of a good husband. Her grandmother also gave her free consent & said

my good natured things of me. All this was a comfort, but still
I did not know Rose's mind, & she grew very dull I thought & I was
frightened - however I know now it was thoughtful she was about her
change of condition, & she consented to be my wife We were married
the 16th of last May. A few of our neighbours were with us, & we had a
decent wedding such as we could afford. I took a pretty little house between
our two fathers houses & about six acres of land, which Rose can
manage with their advise when I am away from her which must
be often - but then the earning for her, & the thought of coming back will
be so pleasant. And now, as reserved as Rose was, she has told me
since we married that she loved me sincerely In a long time before I
asked her for a wife, & preferred me to all other men for a husband
Now dear James I hope you will write to me soon, & tell me
how you all are, & how your farming business is getting on: My
father had great good of his Mangel Wurzel, & not a neighbour
of ours who has an acre of land, but has sowed more or less of it
& you may be sure I did so too, & we mind to have the rape
plants ready to put in afterwards. Rose has got a present of a
stock of Bees, & I made a little house for her as like your's as I could
& about two weeks ago the hive threw out a very fine swarm
which we put into it, & they are working finely & my dear
girl is greatly delighted with it. How happy it would make
us all to see you or any of your good family at our little place
& tho' we could not entertain you, as you entertained us, we
would [deletion]manage[/deletion] do our best to make you comfortable, & you
would put us in the way of making the most of our little bit of
land. My father desires his kind love to you all, & Rose
sends her hearty service, & I am in great truth
your affe.. friend
