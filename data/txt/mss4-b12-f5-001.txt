Dear Cousin
Tho' I have not the Pleasure to be personally
acquainted with thee; nor any of thy Family, yet I can't well,
in point of Gratitude, excuse myself from addressing thee, to
return thee my sincerest Acknowledgmts. for thy very kind
Present send me, by thy Husband, to London & from thence,
by Cousin Birkbeck, at whose Hands I receiv'd it - I impute
thy Remembrance of me (I assure thee) to the right Cause, not to
any Merit of my own, I attribute it solely to the regard thou
had to my dear deceas'd Father being too conscious of my own
Misconduct to imagine I [unclear][/unclear] not
but thou [unclear][/unclear] to a Person of a different
Profession, about 4 years & a half ago, by which tho' I have very
[unclear][/unclear]deservedly forfeited my unity with Friends, yet my Love is
[unclear][/unclear] I hope ever will [insertion]be[/insertion] strong towards them, & I sincerely desire it
may please the Father of Mercies to restore me, in his own
good Time, once more a not altogether unworthy Member to
his People - . I can't well express myself to thee in a manner
adequate to the grateful Sentiments of my Heart for thy
[unclear][/unclear]unimented Kindness - for be assured, it is not thy Present,
handsome & generous as it was, that so much affects me as
the Circumstances attending it - to be so kindly acknowledg'd
[unclear][/unclear] my Situation, at such a Distance & by a distant Relation
[unclear][/unclear] one whom I have never seen, was [unclear][/unclear] an unexpected
[unclear][/unclear] even uncommon Favour - As to the surviving Part of
our Family, My Brother is yet unmarried, has a good School
& my Sister keeps his House, & is very serviceable to him -
With regard to myself (as above hinted) I have been two years
& a half married have had 3 Children the first time two at
a Birth one of which died [deletion]the other a Girl[/deletion] & I myself narrowly
escaped with my Life, having a very difficult Time the other a
Girl whom we call'd Elisabeth & is now near a year & three Quarters
old I have also a fine Boy about 20 Weeks old, but I find myself

so incapable of doing almost any thing for my Children, thro' my
unhappy Defficiency, that I am at times greatly discouraged, but
hope thro' the assistance of Providence to be enabled to get 'em up,
as my Husband thus far is a sober industrious Man - he leaves
the Education of my Children to me, but alas I am very anxious
how it may be if I shou'd be taken from 'em, in their Infancy, my
greatest Desire for 'em being that they may be brought up in the
Fear of the Lord, & amongst his People - my Brother & Sister
join me in dear Love to thyself & Husband & Son & Daughter &
Cousin Barnard, - Dear Cousin under a deep Sense of thy
[unclear][/unclear]unmented Kindness to me, in my present desolate Situation being
a poor Outcast, an acknowledg'd Member of no Religious Society,
permit me to subscribe [unclear][/unclear] Esteem thy
[unclear][/unclear] Eliz Hall
