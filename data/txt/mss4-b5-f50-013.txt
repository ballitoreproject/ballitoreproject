Helen Gillers's 2 Hay's street Edinburgh 7 Mo. 8 - 1820
Thomas Fisher to Mary Leadbeater
I received thy letter dated the 9th of 2nd month
I am glad to find [underline]one[/underline] to concur with me in my [unclear]mood[/unclear]
of commencing letters, it is not always that a man can get
even [underline]one[/underline] to agree with him in opinion.
Yes, I shall endeavour to make a friend of Margaret
Bonham's friend, Henry Saulter - [insertion]both[/insertion] Joshua Harvey & I are
now pretty well acquainted with him, & we have many
more opportunities of cultivating our acquaintance with him
now, than we had the busy winter.- He has been lately
in London, & has brought a little brother with him, who
is a nice little lad-
Thou hast by this time I suppose read Peter's letters
to his kins kinsfolks it will give thee a pretty good idea
of the [underline]nobs[/underline] of Edinburgh, but it is too highly
coloured, but it has been evidently published as a [underline]puff[/underline]
to Blackwood's magazine & its supporters, & to injure, if
possible that most excellent work, the Edinburgh Review,
& the holders of its enlightened principles.- I am often
does the reality which follows appear cold & dreary! How often do even th[unclear][/unclear]
grieved to see us depart, grieves more to see us return, & how often do we ourselves
encounter nothing [unclear][/unclear] but sorrow, on again beholding the once happy, gay
promoters of our own hilarity, now mournful, disappointed, & themselves needling
what consolation we may bring.-
Im am much pleased at thy having commenced a correspondence with
Henry Dawson, [deletion]partly[/deletion] [insertion]both[/insertion] on account of the advantage which he will probably
decide from it. & on account of it keeping up a communication between my
uncle's family & [deletion]Ball[/deletion] you in Ballitore, whom I wish to become more &
more acquainted with each other. I hope Thomas Harvey continues attentived
to his studies, & that the fine summer weather & your company & conversation
are not weaning him from them.-
Tell Sarah that I am [underline]not[/underline] in London, & that I am very much obliged
to hear for the pleasure she has afforded me; as a slight acknowledgement of which
I send her with thou a Scotsman, which contains some judicious remarks on the education
of the poor, & an article which, if she has studied school economy, must
be interesting to her on the [unclear]tender[/unclear] with the [unclear][/unclear].-
Edward Alexander has written me an account of a first [unclear][/unclear] hand[/unclear] visit which he

astonished [deletion]that[/deletion] [unclear]this[/unclear] when I think that the northern [unclear]tract[/unclear]
which is read with such a delight every where but in Scotland
should issue from this ultra-tory metropolis, when
every one who allows the Review or the Scotsman into his
house, he is denounced as an enemy to his religion, & a rebel
to his king.-
Gloomy indeed is the present aspect of public affairs,
it becomes more & more gloomy every day, & will probably
continue to do so, till the dreadful crisis comes at last, for
come it must: - I certainly do not believe that so disgraceful
an act as the coronation of the king [unclear][/unclear], will be
allowed to take place on the first of next month in London
without some violent popular commotion. The public
mind is strongly interested, & with reason, in favour of our
persecuted but noble & high minded queen. I should like
to hear what Melesina says on this subject in such a
political question as this, women ought surely to be allowed
to declare their sentiments Oh! if our lamented
Princess were living how differently [unclear] would our rulers [/unclear] act . Oh!
if she were living how differently would her time-serving
husband act, who has now shown himself unworthy of such
a woman.- - I think many parts of Cowper's poems are particularly
lately paid to Athens: He says "I never felt a visit to Athens more grateful:_ -
contrasted with the world I live in, its [unclear]cases[/unclear], intentions, & appointments, it seems
a little spot set apart to give the weary rest, where like the sacred territory
of this peace should always reign -
On fifth day week, on going [deletion]to[/deletion][insertion] to one of the lectures, I was agreeably surprised
to meet James Henry.- The next day we attended several lectures together
& he came to take tea with me in the evening, after which we took a walk
round Salisbury Craigs _ he admires Edinburgh but will not allow that it is
as fine a city as Dublin. He told me that he ascended Helvellyn, saw
Juliet Smith & Thomas Wilkinson & his sister, was surprised at T.W's T. W's activity,
could not keep up with him in walking &c &c [unclear][/unclear].- _ On first day he called on me
to go with him to hear Alison preach - he disliked the sermon & I was so
much pleased with it. On second day we took an excursion on foot to Boston
castle romantically situated about 8 miles from this on the North Side, the banks
of which present a display of rich & beautiful scenery _ That evening, he took
tea with me again. On fifth day he called on me to take me to the courts to
[unclear][/unclear] not to me Scott & Jeffrey whom he had previously seen.- Just as we [unclear][/unclear]

entering, we saw Sir Walter going [unclear][/unclear] for his hat, & we stopped at the door
to let him pass close by us.- I did not perceive any thing remarkable in
his appearance, except his lameness which is much greater than I had supposed _
I do not think he is like any portrait of him that I have seen, not
even as much so as that I should have known him on meeting him in the street.
We then proceeded through the courts in pursuit of Jeffrey whom at length we
found sitting along with several of his fellow advocates, all of whom soon left the
court but Jeffrey & another, so as to leave me a pretty good view of the former.
Each spoke but a few words, & Jeffrey was arguing for a cause being postponed which
He thus wished to be brought on immediately. He has an uncommon kindness
& quickness in his manner, & while his adversary was speaking, I observed him
evidently [deletion]impatient[/deletion]express impatience both in his look & manner, till he should use
to remain as long as I [incorrect to see a line] more of these great men. After
& refute all his arguments, which when he did, he rattled on with such extreme
rapidity, & with such a Scotch accent, that I could scarcely collect half what
he said - whatever it was, however, it had its effect on the judges for the cause
was postponed & they both retired - James Henry soon after went away, but I resolved
to remain as long as I could to see a little more of these great men. After
walking up & down the room for some time, & watching Jeffrey closely when he happened
to be present at length I observed Sir Walter Scott walk up
to Jeffrey to speak to him & they continued in conversation for some minutes
& dreadfully applicable to the present state of public affairs
[unclear][/unclear], especially that tender lofty & (I think I may say)
prophetic one, entitled Expostulation -
I was much pleased with the papers thou sent me, as a
memento of good old times, when I was a schoolboy.- Though
I then had many pleasures which I now do not possess,
yet I do not sigh much after these past enjoyments, as
I have now many new sources of happiness, of which I
never thought of then.- Surely the Author of our being has
distributed happiness [deletion]pretty[/deletion] equally through [deletion]ea[/deletion] every
season, as well as through every [deletion]station[/deletion] [insertion]rank[/insertion]
of life.
Have you yet seen in Ballitore Anastursius
or the Memoirs of a [unclear][/unclear] supposed to be written by
Lord Byron the hero is a bad character [deletion]until ne[/deletion] & attended
by a constant sun of prosperity, until near the conclusion
when he becomes a penitent & then misfortune attends him to
his death;- but he dies happily. The following extraction possesses
much of the tone of Lord Byron's writing: Ah how often does it happen in life that the most moments of our return to a longleft
in life that the most blissful moments of our return to a longleft
home, are those only that just precede the instant of our arrival,
these during which the imagination still is allowed to
paint in its own unblended colours the promised sweets of our
reception, how often, after this glowing pictures of the phantasy

each opportunity of seeing them both again.
In the last letter
which I had from my brother James, he
denies great enthusiasm on behalf of
the [unclear][/unclear] - Joshua Harvey & I left this
early the morning on an excursion with professor
Jameson's pupils along the coast of Fifeshire
We crossed the Firth of Forth in a
steam boat & breakfasted at a little village
on the other side. We saw several very
delightful sea & land prospects & had
on the whole a very agreeable excursion.
Joshua said as is such his affectionate
remembrance, & desires Betsey Shackleton to be
informed that her letter was exceedingly acceptable,
& that he has not yet received
the packet of letters which she mentions
having left with Joseph Humphreys.
He is soon busy printing his thesis of which
he has given a dedication to James White.
I hope thou wilt not wait for a part
or [unclear][/unclear] opportunity to write to me
Salute all my friends
Farewell
little man who appears so dwarfish by his side, the quiet Reviewer
of his works, is that the man, whose oracular judgements are listened
to all over the world with [insertion]such [/insertion]admiration & reviewed. - While engaged in
these aflictions the two mighty men separated. I went out, & going
down the High-street, I stopped at a shop window, & I soon after saw
Scott again pass me & thought that, but for his lameness, had I met
him there the day before, I should not have even suspected who he was._
walking up & down together _ I did the same & passed & repassed them
several times_ I felt almost as in a dream when I considered that
I was looking at two men, whose writings had afforded me so much
pleasure. Is it possible "thought I to myself as I looked at Whig
& Tory in apparently friendly conversation. Is it possible that that magestic
& stately figure, lame in his gait & heavy, & at times rather morose
countinance is the Author of Waverly & is that lively French-like
