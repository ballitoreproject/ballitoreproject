Dear Madam
I have just received your note, but
fear you have been hurried in returning Darwin's
Botanic Garden — That you have been charmed
with it, affords me much pleasure — His imagery
is beautiful, but, I fear, his Philosophy would
not in some instances stand the test of criticism —
I am happy to inform you that your request in
favour of Miss Costello is succesful — I send it
back at your disposal & hope you will be so
kind as to return it as soon as convenient - Mrs
Power having asked for it — I remain, Dear Madam,
Monday Evening
very truly your's
John Paul
