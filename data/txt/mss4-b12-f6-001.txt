Clonmel: : 21/1 mo. 1785.
My dear friend
I take the liberty to address thee with a few lines to request
thou wilt be so kind as to get for me from Polly Stokes some papers,
I lent her before she left Clonmel, if thou hast opportunity so to do.
When I was last in Cork I suffered in my mind beyond the
power of words to describe a horrour of great darkness seemed to fall upon me,
when hints were given me of that wretched girl's misconduct - and because
I had thought that I felt a little ability to send her a few lines by way of
encouragement, I doubted for a time all my feelings, & as if the light of
the sun never shone upon my mind - I thought of Jonah, who said in his
distress, that the weeks were wrapped about his head - & I longed for an opportunity
to open my mind to thee - I rejoiced however that she was not
received into outward membership with us, & that the innocent youth
escaped her snares, whom it seems she wanted to be connected with her, to cover
her shame - but that which is done in secret will be proclaimed upon the housetops,
& the things which hypocritical minds would seek to cover shall be
revealed - There is a penetrating eye from which no secret can be hid - This
affair shews me more strongly the propriety of the apostle's advice to his
son Timothy (as he calls him), "Lay hands suddenly on no man" - and
indeed what follows also strikes my mind, "Neither be partaker
"in other men's sins" - keep thyself pure - for there seems like a contamination
to the soul, in touching with such polluted creatures, unless
in bringing judgment over their transgressions, that the camp may be
kept clean, & the precious Truth & it's testimony may be kept blameless.
I sincerely wish the poor unhappy girl may be favoured indeed with the
gift of repentance, & experience that washing & that contrition of heart,
which cleanseth from all defilement, & reconciles to a Being of purity - but
as she was so deep in art before this was discovered, no doubt but she is
capable of the same art still, to deceive, if it was possible, the very dect.
[marks x x x x] I conclude, with affectionate nearness
thy sincere friend
Margt. Grubb.
