Newyork 1st Month 4th 1822
My dear Friend
Thy very acceptable letter of
8th mo 15th, was received some time ago, & has remained
unanswered longer than I had intended;- but
owing to business, & temporary absence from home,
I have been obliged to procrastinate from week to
week, until at length "conscience goaded," I [deletion]could[/deletion] [insertion]can[/insertion]
restrain my pen no longer. -
About the time thy letter arrived I was enjoying
myself very agreeably at the house of a gentleman
in the Country, about 100 miles from this City, near the
banks of the Hudson river. -
I joined a party
of my most particular friends in an excursion of
pleasure to the Catskill mountains in the early
part of the 9th month, after which I went to the place
above mentioned. -
Those Mountains are situated
above Westpoint, & form one of the most picturesque
objects, as they are approached either in ascending
or descending the river. - Thou no doubt remembers
the description given of them in the "Sketch book"
where the story of poor Rip Van Winkle is narrated,
& may suppose, that as the spot where he slept so long

has been made classic ground by the celebrity to which
that spirited work has attained, I felt a double interest
in visiting it. - I fancied that we had
discovered the identical brook & bank near which
honest Rip became the victim of supernatural sleep,
-but I looked in vain for the relic of his gun or the
bones of his faithful dog.-
Upon the top of one
of the Mountains, there is a very beautiful Waterfall
whose height is nearly 300 feet perpendicular; but in
Summer the quantity of water is trifling indeed, & rather
forms a Caricature, when compared to the splendid
Amphitheatre into which it descends. The scenery is
just as Nature made it,- wild & woody & peopled with
the various animals that are usually to be found in
the interior of this Country.
I regretted that I possessed
no taste for Sketching, for I never saw views which
struck me as being more appropriate for the pencil, than
some in these Mountains- & I should like to have presented
my Irish friends with specimens of my taste &
execution, to accompany my descriptions.-
As our time
was limited, we remained but one day at the Mountains
& therefore were not able to explore them properly,- for
it requires several days to visit every object of curiosity
in that neighbourhood.-
The great Mammoth
skeleton, which has so completely puzzled both American
& European philosophers, was discovered in one of these

Mountains, & it is presumed that a diligent search
would result in further discoveries of a similar nature
The gentleman at whose house I spent several days
is married to the widow of the celebrated Robert Fulton
who is really a superior woman - accomplished in manners,
& well informed.- She is from one of the first
families in this State.- Fulton left four children, three
lovely girls & a boy, to whom I became much attached
while I remained with them, and indeed I could hardly
get away, their solicitations for a longer visit, were so
pressing.-
Since then, the whole family have gone to
France to spend the winter, intending to return in
Spring.-
I went to Albany, for one day, to
hear the debates in the Convention, which was then assembled
to frame a new Constitution for this State,-
the good people thereof having become tired of the
old one.- I heard no eloquent speeches, however, altho
a vast deal was [underline]said[/underline] in the Legislative hall, & I returned
rather disappointed with the collective wisdom of the
State.-
One member who is remarkable for coarseness
& vulgarity, made an abusive harangue against Quakers
because they would not either do militia duty or pay
a commutation, & he endeavored to carry an amendment
to the existing Constitution, which was directly
levelled against them.- but fortunately the House had
too much liberality to act in concert, & his motion was

therefore, lost.-
Afterwards, however, an article was
adopted, which obliges persons who are conscientious
against bearing arms, to pay a fine annually, if
they refuse to serve as Militia men.- This will
operate severely upon the members of our Society, but
as the Sovereign people [underline]will[/underline] it so, we must suffer.
I paid a visit to Hannah Barnard in Hudson
as I always have done, when in that place. - She begins
to look old & worn, but still has a great flow of
spirits, altho' she has to bear many domestic afflictions
against which few can successfully contend.- She is
very entertaining in conversation, & fond of argument, or
relating her own history - particularly that portion of
it, which all her friends must regret.- I was informed
by some friends in Hudson, that she occasionally attends
the Universalists' meeting - but makes no open profession
with any particular Sect.- Her husband, who is a
plain, simple man, attends Friends' meeting & has the
chief seat in the gallery - he is a Carman by profession.
Hannah was very much offended, some time ago,
by an article which was extracted into some of our papers
from a late History of Dublin, in which her name
is too freely, & in some particulars, falsely abused.-
She wrote a reply, which was published in one of the
City papers - a copy of which is in my possession - it goes
into a detail of her troubles in England - but must necessarily
have been unintelligible to most readers, out of the Society.
