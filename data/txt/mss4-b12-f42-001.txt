Stramore 1st mo 10th 1785 -
Thy last letter my very dear Cousin, was short yet truly acceptable, we
were beginning to look anxiously for it, & I feared thou wast waiting till I wrote
again as I gave thee expectation of doing it soon, I forget now what prevented
me, but I know it was not want of inclination, nor matter, the first I seldom
want for writing to thee, & the length of my letters shew that I still find materials
of one sort to stuff them with, [deletion]but[/deletion] to be sure of their quality I cannot
boast, but thou are So kind as to express thyself satisfied with them. I am sorry
I let brother Richd. see thy letter as it was not agreeable to thee, indeed I
did not much like it at the time but was overpersuaded. I have a guess from
what thy objection proceeds, indeed he is one of the last men in the world that
it would be safe to trust if anything of that sort could be made out, but I
believe he knows thee too well to entertain a thought of the kind; thy affection
for all thy friends male & female, & thy openness in expressing it is so generally
known, that I think they must be either very illnatured or very suspicious
that would accuse thee of any particular attachment from this circumstance,
yet my dear Molly I have sometimes wished thou could practice a little more
disguise. I know it would be a painful task to one of thy open candid disposition,
yet the World in which we live is so censorious, that it seems quite necessary,
for one can hardly shew any particular civility, or express any particular
regard or esteem for a young man but they are charged with being in
love, & such is the ingratitude of the young men themselves that they are
very apt to place it to this account too. But I am far from meaning this
to any thing in thy letters to me, or respecting any person in particular.
I sent a pacquet some days ago to Susy Bewley's care for thee, it was wrote a good
while before & I expected would have gone sooner, it contains among other
things Betty Pim's letter, I am concerned it was so long detained from thee,
but I cannot charge myself much with neglecting it, neither dost thou.
I am rather uneasy my dear Cousin about what I said respecting your Doctor,
as I fear thou hast taken it amiss, & I was far from intending to give any
of you offence, but people will have different opinions, & when any thing
is in my mind, I am not easy till it is out, but I shall hereafter be silent
on the subject I intend, to be sure I know nothing about him except by
hearsay, but I have heard many speak of him who thought he treated his
patients very improperly, & that Sally's jaw was kept longer ill than it
would have been had you been the Doctor yourselves. Now I request thou
may not be angry this time, & I shall say no more.
I do think what thou mentions about Anna Taverner is miraculous,
I suppose you don't expect she will ever regain the use of her speech, but
who can tell, I wish Sally Haughton may respect the advise as an immediate
Thou hast not sent me the poem on Edmund Burke's place, which I long to see, & shall be much obliged to thee if thou wilt send me. I had a letter lately from
D. Prell she desired her dear love to thee, admires thy farewell to the North very much. She enclosed me an elegy on J. Scott by thy friend Wilkinson, hast thou
seen it?

immediate message from Heaven. Poor Anna has had a tedious & distressing
illness, but it is a great favour she is preserved in such a sweet frame of mind.
I have had a comfortable account from Nancy Shannon of the last awful moments
of our dear Mary, what an inexpressible satisfaction must it be to her friends,
to see her so well prepared [insertion]for her change[/insertion] so sensible of it's near approach & so resigned to it,
poor thing she suffered at times exquisite pain, but I trust she is now out of
the reach of pain & sickness, I wish her Sisters may be warned by her early removal,
but alas! the impressions which are made in times of sickness & affliction
are generally too soon erased. Poor Nancy if she was in a favourable situation
would I believe be a valuable woman, what a pity she should lose a good state
she is now I do believe in a tender state of mind, [deletion]of[/deletion] [insertion]when[/insertion] thou writes to her perhaps
thou could say something which might help to strengthen her. Poor [unclear]Jeremy[/unclear]
Clibbern I wish he may be preserved, I believe he keeps steady as yet, I think
with thee my dear Cousin that this is a remarkable time, & that the hand of
Heaven seems more & more extended for our help if we will but embrace the
gracious offers. I exceedingly admire Betty Pim's remarks to thee or wishes
for thee, may thou look at [insertion]it[/insertion] dear Molly! the latter part I thought applicable
to [underline]us[/underline] too, as we are placed in a situation so favourable for improvement, we
should not I think be content to keep pace with any but feel & know for ourselves.
I was exceedingly pleased with thy mention of an unusual gravity being
over thee, 'tis frequently the case with me, I wish we may be enabled to make the
proper use of such seasons, I always look upon it as a call to retire from the World
& endeavour to seek after that knowledge which it cannot afford us, but indeed
I am not fit to speak of such things. - We were all grieved to hear of dear
John Pimberton's being so ill, I hope [deletion]he[/deletion] [insertion]the use of his hand[/insertion] will soon be restored to him, we are
expecting to hear from him soon, it was a sad thing for the poor dear Man to
be deprived of the satisfaction of writing. We have heard of Mahetabel's
being [unclear]in[/unclear] the small pox at Samuel Neale's, it was hoped in a favorable way
I wish the worthy little woman may be restored to health, she is in a good
place for being taken care of. On looking over thy former letter which I had
not time fully to reply to when I wrote last, I find thou mentions an
opportunity at J. Smithson's & desires to know whether my Mother remembers
it, she does but did not think either then or since that that part
respecting afflictions was addressed to her, but perhaps it was notwithstanding
but I suppose some of what he said her diffidence or humility
made her think too good for her. Jenny Watson had something to drop in
opportunity I believe at Mt melick that my mother did take to herself,
which was of the same nature. - James's health we hope is pretty fully
established, [insertion]&[/insertion] I wish the impressions of good which [insertion]I believe[/insertion] he received during the time
of his illness were as much so, but alas it is too much the case with us all, in
times of affliction perhaps we turn a little to Him who can only help us, but

when health & prosperity again shine round us, we are too apt to forget
what we then felt. James wants but the one thing to make him a fine young
man. Did I ever tell thee what H. Barrington & S. Stephenson had to say to him
I believe not, for thou wast I think in England at the time. I cannot now recollect
the words, but I know I wished thou had heard them. They knew nothing
almost about him at the time, & yet spoke as clearly & suitably to his
state as it was possible, recommending the study of Heavenly more than
earthly wisdom & described in a very lively manner the effect which that
wisdom that the World admires is too apt to have on the minds of those
that possess it. I write to thee my dear Molly without reserve & trust
thou wilt be careful not expose my letters, for besides that I may say many
things I would not wish others to see, my letters are not worth shewing
to any one, I am sensible of thy prudence, but I know thy openness, & that
that thou art loth to refuse when thou art asked to shew thy letters.
There is melancholy accident has happened in this neighbourhood about
a week ago, which is at present the principal subject of conversation here - one
attorney who lived in Tanderagee (brother to the one employed by our fam[unclear]ily[/unclear]
 his name W. Crozier had been at Banbridge seeing his brother and returning necessar[unclear][/unclear]
thro' Guilford stopped & drank some at a publick house, one of his acqua[unclear][/unclear]
saw he was not in a state capable of taking care of himself, therefore [unclear][/unclear]
difficulty prevailed on him to let a man go with him, but he presen[unclear][/unclear]
him back, it was then about seven o'clock in the evening, & [insertion]as he did not care[/insertion] between [unclear][/unclear]
his wife sent two men to meet him or look for him, for as he was near[unclear][/unclear]

went home.
she was the more uneasy about him, the men I think deserve to be half[unclear][/unclear]
for instead of going on they stopped at a ale house near the Madden bridge [unclear][/unclear]
there drinking, in the morning the country was alarmed, & it seemed to be the
opinion of many that he was murdered [insertion]all[/insertion] the waters about were sea[insertion]r[/insertion]ched for his
body, & after four days search it was found, a surgeon was sent for to examine
it who gave it as his opinion that he was strangled, several circumstances seem
to corroberate this, tho' his watch & money were yet in his pockets, but it is
supposed by his being stiff &c that he was but one night in the water, & that
these were put in his pockets again when it was found his [insertion]friends[/insertion] were not like
to give up looking for him, the awful villains I suppose thought it would be
given up that he had fallen off his horse & was drowned when his watch & money
were yet in his pockets, I do not hear of any person's being suspected for the murder,
but I do believe they will be found out yet. He left a wife a sensible
discreet woman who is much to be pitied, & one child by another wife. -
+Wilt thou excuse me for so long deferring to mention the history of your visit
to Edmund Burke, I am far from thinking it tedious, & have examined Johnson for
the definition of [underline]rhapsody[/underline], & find according to him it is not rhapsodical either, tho' I
had thought it was, but be that as it may I am very much obliged by it, I read it
I think thou had need to have had a good stock of humility which I hope
thou hast not be set up by thy visit to Edmund Burke.+

to my Grandfather & to all the family, & we were all exceedingly entertained with it,
& it was agreed by those who least esteemed the [underline]Hero[/underline] of it, that "Molly could act off any
subject," indeed I think it is a very fine piece, for I look upon not as a letter but one of thy
prose writings. I was sorry when I got to the end of it, it diverted my Grandfather highly
he desired me twice since I began to write to give his love to thee & also to the rest of
the family. I could say a deal more to thee if I had time, but I must prepare to go
abroad, for we are to drink tea at my [unclear][/unclear] Sister's this evening, previous to poor
Nancy's lying in which is expected almost every day. All the large part of that
family have their dear love to thee, they are always rejoiced to hear from thee as are
all the neighbours. I fully intended to have wrote this on 7th day whether I had got
thine or not, but I was so bad with a headach that I had to go to bed instead of writing.
All the family are now in pretty good health except that Aby is frequently
ill with his stomach, & that Williams leg which I believe I mentioned being
strained is still lame, he got it at Mill-park during the frost. Peggy [unclear]Dinton[/unclear] is
much better, my Sister Pike thinks herself better, but I think she is yet far
from well, she cannot certainly tell whether what I mentioned in my last be so or
not, her breast & stomach are both affected at times yet & she has a cough, but she
is better. Dear cousin James continues weak in body, my mother intends going
to see him this week. I must bid thee farewell tho' I part with reluctance
All our family join me in dear love to yours, but particularly I am with
cordial affection my dear cousin ever thine,
Margt. Pike.
