Dublin May & June 1821
Dear Eliza
Richard came back pleased with his visit, as a supplement
to it, you have had my father Edward and RJ. down with you
fishing. I heard Manliff was very proud for catching a larger trout
than either Edward or my Father caught. Do you see Manliff often and
how do you think he is getting on both in disposition and learning?
I have read the Doge of Venice Lord Byrons new tragedy, and
have been greatly pleased with it. The plot is founded on a circumstance
in the history of Venice sometime in the 14th century.
Marino Faliero was a man greatly respected by the Senate and
people of Venice, on account of his great talents as a warrior and
statesman, being always appointed on business where the welfare
of the State was concerned. They made him Doge without his
seeking the office, it was the interest of the Senate after he was
made Doge to restrain his power as far as they were able; he
being an old man was married to the young daughter of his deceased
friend [insertion]she was[/insertion] called Angelina It [deletion]is[/deletion] happened at an assembly given by
the Doge, that a young Senator behaved in a manner not suited to the
place, he was turned out by order of the Doge, he in revenge wrote
a lampoon on the wife of the Doge, and left it on [deletion]his[/deletion] [insertion]the Doge's[/insertion] seat in the Senate
house, with which he was so much hurt that he brought it before the
Senate, who punished the author so slightly, that the Doge in

revenge, conspired to overturn the State, in which he did not
succeed, he was therefore beheaded. This forms the plot of the tragedy.
Though I am after writing down all this I dont know but you knew
it as well as did myself.
Do you think it generally the case that those who talk most, manage
to fill up letters fastest, that is if they are not fretting about what the
person they are writing to will think of it; you know I do not talk
much, nor have I opportunities either to see or hear much, therefore
I find it very hard to fill up a letter, it is, judging from my own case
that makes me ask the question?
The summer is going over fast, there is no sooner a resolution
formed than it is broken, I am afraid I shall never be good for
anything; I make a resolution to do a thing and it is either not
done through forgetfulness, or for want of perseverance to perform it, I will
see the great propriety of doing it, at one time and another time, I
will think it may not be worth doing. I will think in the evening
a thing of great consequence and in the morning I will think it a
trifle. It is this thinking and feeling what is right and not
acting up to it after, that is the source of all the errors committed
in the world, people are satisfied with themselves when they
have the passion when it is action they ought to have.
When I read over this I am tempted to blot it out it is so

confused, but even take it as it is and make the best of it.
I have read Thompson's Spring again, [insertion]his descriptions[/insertion] [deletion]it[/deletion] seem[deletion]s[/deletion] quite alive
to my eyes, it pleased me more than his Summer, his descriptions
of nature are a great deal better, than his descriptions of art and
characters of great men.
This is the time for the country, I hope you enjoy as much of it
as you can; have you taken any excursion anywhere yet?
At the time I am writing this, I am sitting by myself in the
drawing room, looking out at the reflection of the setting sun
on the Clouds. Edward being in Glendruid and Richard & Lucy
at S Gamble's. How has D S got her health since she returned
and how are all your friends there. You ask m[unclear][/unclear]
Sir Charles Grandison makes use of disimulation, [unclear][/unclear]
he makes use of it, as Lord C means, in the scene with
Lady Beauchamp. I think whatever difference there is
between you and me with regard to dissimulation is only
in the meaning we attach to the word.
Have you finished Stewart and what are you reading
now answer this as suits your pleasure
