My dear Cousin,                                                 Ballitore: 10/6 month 1777.
			As I expect to go to Carlow to morrow to attend our Meeting of discipline, & perhaps affairs of that sort may detain me some successive days from home, I thought I would send thee a line before I set off, though perhaps a letter may come hither from thee to morrow. We understood by thy Letter to Peggy that thou had got well home, &c. We are favoured here in general with tolerable health. Thy Mother & sister Carleton set off to day for Athy, from whence thy Mother & daughter intend (I suppose) for Derrygarran. Thy Mother was complaining of a pain in her hip, for which Aby electrified her yesterday & to day, & hope it will have its wonted efficacy with her. Mary Watson of Blakefield rather better by last accounts, perhaps may hold out some little time. Eben Miller has had a variety of symptoms seemingly better & worse: on the whole I believe not likely to last long. Aby returned from Edenderry 8th instant, his success still uncertain, his love I believe no way abated, & his hopes not diminished. I still think it will do: but probably Tribulation & Patience have not had their measures yet full. I hear Robert Dudley has presented his marriage. Amby Greenhow still fluttering about Sally Pim I suppose, John Grubb waiting for his departure, to make trial what he can do for himself. Jimmy Abells proposal for Betty Pim taken into consideration. William Leckys daughter Jenny to be married 12th instant at Killconner. Robert Leckys to be the Wedding-house. John Conran (I hear) gone lately to Mountmellick, but I dont hear with what success. Thus the people are marrying & giving in marriage, or doing their best towards it. Sister Carleton, Betty Shannon & our Sally intend a visit to Peggy as soon as they well can. We hear lately from her: she & her son bravely, he (by accounts) thrives finely.
	I herewith hand thy Sons Account, please strike the Balance, which may be remitted me as most convenient, along with the Twelve pounds, which thy Father had to send me. John is (thank Providence) well & hearty, & I hope will make a good scholar & a good man. All our dear love attends you all. Thy truly affectionate Kinsman
Richard Shackleton
