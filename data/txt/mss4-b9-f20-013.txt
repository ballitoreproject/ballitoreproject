10th Mo: 1827
My dear Elizth- I read thy very acceptable letter by
Edw I would wish to have the large bedstead & bed before spring
to it I dont suppose the [unclear]pillinsser[/unclear] would be worth the
carriage but thou canst judge of that if it be
a bad one it wouldnt, I would like to have another
bed the one thou mentions with soil'd tick wd do
I think it would be best for thee to keep the little
bedstead as it can be open'd or shut occasionally
if thou want'd, for company it belong'd to
[unclear]Grettan[/unclear] so that I have no veneration for it
& I think the curtains of it were thy own
I would like to have some pillows, what thou
can spare from thy own & Richd's use I suppose
[unclear][/unclear]does not want any thou wilt know the value
of all I get, would it not be well for D to keep
the furniture in the Retreat that she might
set it, but why do I speak who knows nothing
about the matter, I have been teas'd with
a to shake like thyself & kept my hed a
day lonely enough it is now better I mean to
get it onto if I am let I mention'd thy having
a room or two or 3 to let to several I think it
is quite likely thou'd get one or two quiet females
to occupy them, I suppose my aunt will go the 1st of
dont be displeased with anything I have said about the furniture
I mean her knows best just wrote as I will speaking to
thee I hope soon to see thou when thou comes to administer
[deletion]Edw[/deletion] I hope & Johnson will find an [unclear]a/c[/unclear] for this one
Maggie is almost as well as ever sit quite thy SB
to story but her tongue is cleaner than ever it
has been since she was an infant Willy's long legs
still run to troublesome little Nizer bravely
dont thou think the bedstead should be put up to
make them look well for [unclear]the as time -[/unclear]
The pencil for Lydia I left in John's case to send when
an opportunity would offer & thought he had sent it Deb
I return'd from Ballitore where to my dismay I found
it still at our house, I then sent it to M Gough
thinking she was more in the way of leaving of
opportunities to Limerick
Jane Chandler would be greatly obliged to thee to open her drawers
& send her a cloke of my aunts which is in there & which
she wishes to have for the winter. I told her I thought thou

the month, she & thou wilt be come good friends
as soon as you jiast & I daresay she will
often come spend a day with thee, I forgot
to tell Edw to pay thee for 3 or more letters which
I ow'd for Deborah has an account against me
she would pay thee, I hope to get letters by Jane
Alllen who I hear is to return this week is it
true that Henry Allen is going ot take a Mill?
I has written the above when Ed brought me thy letter perhaps
all is for the best & that the little bed stead may be of more use to me
than to thee for company at a meeting time I wish I could see thee to
have a dish of chat, I w'd like an other good bed if convenient & am quite
satisfied with the price of feathers or to buy it at the auction which ever
thou thinks best I think the large bedstead high enough I would get
a handsome new one such as our own for 5 guineas it is a queer
thing to be bargaining about it as if it were not all one in the end
I did not want curtains as I meant to get new ones & those were too short
perhaps they might sell well by auction in the country I will tell of
the blankets when I see them
5th day
would do so much
for her with pleasure
she & Debby send
their love to
thee
Elizth Leadbeater
Ballitore
