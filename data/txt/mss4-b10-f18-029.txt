Queenstown - Cork
July 7th 1858
My dear Mamma
Though I suppose
you are not uneasy about
us now, as you know we intend
keeping the yacht safe
in this nice harbour till after
the Regatta, I just write
this to tell you we are quite
well, and we hope you are the
same - it was very pleasant
to meet Arthur yesterday

Evening, he came by a steamer
from Cork, just as we arrived
by another, from being to
see Ballincurry &c at the
end of the harbour -
Arthur says the weather has
been very cold with [insertion]you,[/insertion] and
except the first two or three
days it has been like winter
with us, though we are in
what is considered such
a mild place, it has been
showery and blowing latterly -
this harbour has a great
number of vessels always
going in or out - we had
five vessels of war in it yesterday
- and the American
vessel Niagara is here after
her mishap about the Cable
I had a letter from my
sister Mary in which she
mentions that her Sam is
only very poorly, he sleeps
at Mrs Gamble's every night
for change of air, and goes
in to the Bank in the day

time - and now I must
say Farewell as we are
preparing to go out - give
my dear love to Lucy, whom
Arthur says is still with
you, I hope you have got
your carriage to keep you
both from getting cold, also
love to M - G - & Frank &
believe me your much attached
MJB -
Manliff bids me open this to give
his love to you & he hopes you
got the carriage all right
