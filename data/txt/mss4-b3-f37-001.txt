Dear Cousin
Richard Shackleton


        As we think it is not unlikely but thee or some of thy Family may be in London, and having this Oppertunity [sic] thought I would not miss it, to let thee know how we are at present, My Father & Mother is much as they have been for some time in health, my Father as [sic] them fits as Usual, this Morning he had one we did not see him till he was set on the ground with his back agane [sic] the Wall, but he his [sic] brave again now through mercy. which [sic] I hope we are thankfull [sic] for, I have been poorly my self but am agood [sic] deal better my Sister Jane came to see me last Fifth day week & we had a little talk, it is the first time I have spoke to her to have any Talk, she fret much and I believe will have reason to do so, but my desire is that I may mind my self and desire Providence to go along with me in chouseing [sic] a Wife, but I believe if Jane and some others had thought I should have been so poorly they would never have been for it  for I can truly say I have no pleasure of my Time at Selby, & to leave my Father & Mother now I cannot think of it except I was going to Marry, then I believe it would be a great pleasure to my Parents and would be the greatest means to make me not think so much about my poor Sister, which I believe there is nothing frets her so much as thinking about me taking it so ill  but Providence is all sufficient. it [sic] may be for my good, & I hope I shall allways [sic] have it before me & let her harms be my warns, [sic] We had the Month Meeting at Selby last month I whent [sic] to York for my Aunt Shackleton she stayed 2 Days with us then I carryed [sic] her to York again all Relations pritty [sic] well there. I was at Tadcaster a piece since Cousin R. Holborn & Familys well but have not been at Leeds latly [sic], should have gon [sic] last Markit [sic] day but was not well enough to venture ought [sic], thinks of beeing [sic] there next Third day if all be wellIf it should sute [sic] thee and any of thy Family that may be in London, at this Time to come down into Yorkshire we shall be pleased to see you, I think my Cousin Mary mentioned in one of ^her^ letters that it did not sute [sic] you to come last year, but you had it before you at some other Time so   wishes it may be at this time,  My Cousin Sally Armitage has been very poorly in her Eye this Winter but it is better now and she desired me to give her kind Love to thee Sally, and often wishes with myself for thee to be at Selby [paper torn] walk with us for Selby is quiet [sic] dull, and I often thinks Jane as [sic] taken all away with her, Joseph Overend as [sic] left Selby and gone to live at Hull he as [sic] got well fixt there and desired me to give his Love to Cousin Sally when I wrote, I think she will remember him it is that young Man that she paid such alarge [sic] Compliment to, by saying he was the most like the great man Edmund Burke of any she knew, My Father & Mother joines [sic] with me in Love to thee or any of thy Family
