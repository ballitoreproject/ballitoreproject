Waterford 25th 3rd mo: 1823.
My dear friend
I hope the contribution expected from
me, has not inconveniently delayed the publication contemplated
of a selection of they excellent fathers, excellen - 
letters: those he favoured me with in the early per[insertion]i[/insertion]od of our
correspondence were laid up so carefully they could not be
met with for a considerable time, nor am I yet dear
that - the whole are brought to light: this [insertion]is[/insertion] one cause why
my engagement has not been sooner fulfilled: I have selected
twenty, & would observe for thy information that such
parts as are marked by straight-pencil lines in the
margin are intended for insertion in thy collection, should
thou consider them desirable, & possessing sufficient
varrity to excite interest in those class of readers we
may most wish to be profited, & yet [insertion]who [/insertion] are desirous of meeting
with something new: his communications were
to me invaluable when first rcvd_ often peculiarly adapted
to my situation at the time: -- and now, after the passing
of many years, the same precious influence seems to
attend their reperusal: wincing, altho' his subject was
frequently that, which is most ancient, that was even
from the beginning, yet is ever new through the
animating virtue which giveth life: this venerates
object of grateful remembrance, still stands
unrivalled in my estimation, as a letter writer,

the matter, the manner, the [unclear]ello altogether [/unclear] were
remarkably corresponding! Those paragraphs crossd
by the pencil, are not intended for the public eye,
Perhaps thou may find several parts of letters
without marks the disposal of such are left to
thy discretion, more particularly into only as some especially
relate to his own immediate family, & our dear
A Savernr[/unclear] &c. in whose welfare I felt & continue
to feel an affectionate concern. Individuals
still in the body, whose warfare is not yet fully
accomplished, naturally shrink from the idea of
an exhibition even of the initials of their names
in such a work as that now designed. I have so
felt for myself, & others; and am unacquainted wth.
thy intention on the present occasion: nevertheless
have reason to apprehend the method pursued in
the former publication in this respect has excite
& increased a warm interest with many in its
contents: Initials [underline]only[/underline], I expect will be given, should
it be concluded even so far to discriminate
and now my dear friend may I take a little liberty
of remarking on a very delicate subject? I knew something
of the intimacy that subsisted between thy
honoured father & E Burke, of the esteem the latter
was held in by him; I am also aware of the respect &
regard manifested by him to thy fathers family, and to

his memory [deletion]since[/deletion] which naturally produced reciprocation
of feelings grateful & affectionate - by such
impressions preoccupying the mind, the Judjement
is sometimes biased to an appreciation of things
beyond their merits: on that field of action where
EB spent the greater part of his life & where he was
well known, his character did not generally neither
now does stand in so favourable a point of view, as it
does at Ballitore. The inference wch. I would draw
from this suggestion is, that so much mention of EB in
the valuable publication alluded to does not in my apprehension
add to its value; similar sentiments I have heard
other express! his letter on the decease of thy father I
think was not wanted; it's operation on the mind is widely
different from that produced by the genuine expression
of worthy T:Wilkerson on the same affecting occasion: I
should be pleased when another edition is printed that the
letter in question might at least be omitted: I trust this
freedom will not offend or influence farther than it
ought - and that the motive will be fully understood.
& Not knowing how to direct to thy nephew at Clonmel
being unacquainted with his first name, have concluded to
forward this & the packet intended for thee, by some friend
to MountMilick wch hope will reach safety, and altho' it may
be a little longer delayed: among the letters I expect one
will be found to me especially precious, as thou will
conceive when apprised it - was addressed to my dear
husband years before I was acquainted with him
It was pleasant to hear of the safety on thy daughter,
lately become a mother, also of the agreeable prospect

respecting her who has more recently left you
we hear but poor accts of thy dear Sisr. Grubbs health
offer affectionate salutations on behalf of my Jane, & myself
self to my sisters Sarah [insertion]Chandler[/insertion] & Shackleton to thy Elizabeth
[unclear]R.S.[/unclear] & such other Branches of the family to whom it may
be acceptable: also to my long dear A Taverner with her
faithful companion and our kind frd. E Bammeson &c.
our valued neighbour & frd. William Blain is in a
fever supposed the 8th day: Julia, wife of Josh Jacob
is similarly affected: they are both very ill, yet the
physicians do not announce any unfavourable symtoms
Richd. Jacob is convalescent, but much weakened.
I remain thy affectionate frd. M Watson
Having understood that tho Greer Jacob was possesed
of a considerable number of letters from Richd. Shackelton
Address'd to his father & Sr and father (S:J's) my daughter
address[insertion]'d[/insertion] to his father & Grandfather (S:J's) my daughter
applied for permission to inspect them on behalf of the
publication now preparing: he declined: if thou thinks
it expedient, an immediate application from thyself
to him might be more efficacious.
