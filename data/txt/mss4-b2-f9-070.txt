Ballitore: 5/9 month 1784.

My dear Cousin,

	I acknowledge I am in thy epistolary debt, but there is not now time nor convenience to balance the account -- however, I was loath to let this frank go (which I got to cover the inclosed) without a line -- Mollys letters will have given some account of our travels, & of our safe return home through the favour of Providence -- We expect to have the pleasure of thy company ere long, which makes me the less anxious to write to thee -- A great deal may be said in a little time, which would take up a great deal of time to write -- Tommy & Debby have lost their little innocent child -- it must have been a sore trial to them, as they were very fond of it -- By last accounts their little Jane had not taken it ^the Small Pox -- Our Sally is at Athy now -- We have Letters lately from Cork -- thou hast heard (I doubt not) of Thomas Ross (a native of the County Tyrone, who left this country for America when about five years old, & is now about 76) being landed at Cork from Bristol, to visit his own country -- Jonathan Pemberton & Thomas Cash have been going on prosperously in their line of service in those wild, uncouth places towards the South-west of Ireland -- A correspondent writes me that they have met with a good deal of kind treatment, particularly from some of the established clergy, who have accommodated them with their worship-houses -- but the Romish priests have (some of them) shown much envy & malice -- Thomas Ross is expected to be at Waterford Quarterly Meeting this day week -- the destination of J: P: & T: C: was uncertain -- they were lately I suppose at Cork -- I know not where Edward Hatton & Joseph Garratt are now -- If thou sees them, my dear love to them, & to Mehitabel Jenkins -- Rachel Malcomson, &c. & John Grubb called here separately, & gave us a good account of you all, which we are always greatly pleased to hear, hoping the friendship among us will be lasting, may I say everlasting -- John Grubb seemed but poorly -- I understand dear James Morton was lately of his best fashion -- Our dear love to him, to Joseph Nicholson & his wife, & to all our dear friends in Lurgan, to John & Lucy, & to every branch of your family from the Patriarch thy father down to Molly MccLaughlin inclusive -- we are favoured here with tolerable health -- have the company of Anstis Sparks -- When I heard last from Peggy Grubb I suppose they were bravely -- several of her children over the measles. Molly Dudley has got a young daughter -- had a favourable time -- [paper torn] bad fit of the Colick afterwards -- grew better again -- Tom Fayle & Anna Sparrow are about committing matrimony -- Jo Dudley likely to marry Nancy Danckes [?] the convinced young-woman -- Molly Stokes not received into unity with friends at Clonmel, but removed to a Gentlemans house near Cork, where probably she will be admitted into ^our^ society & be married to Nathan Beeby -- Eben Pike recovered wonderfully -- Farewell, my very dear friend & cousin.
