My dearly beloved
Anner Mills 2nd 2nd mo 1823
Mary Leadbeater
I fear that my hesitation may be held
unfavorably in thy view - had I thee with me
then thou wst have the perusal of every letter
in my possession but as the [unclear]deposit[/unclear] abounds
with ingenuous disclosure of thought respecting
divers characters and most interesting matters which
probably would not in general have been communicated to
any other individual I am under difficulty how to act -
A small parcel of extracts - one submitted to [underline]thy[/underline]
selection I entreat that care may be taken to return
them to me, the originals are [[unclear]Hubine[/unclear]] answered
it has been my wish to do so with the whole
collection of letters and I have obtained an amanuensis
though to part with the beautiful writing gives
a pang for I must confess that even the hand
gives strength to the subject - Those thou wilt
find [unclear]tacked[/unclear] were retained for the [unclear]fortification[/unclear] of my
family & thou wilt perceive how cautious I was
even to erase the name of the residence but in
an [unclear]arrival[/unclear] of the writer thou canst [unclear]receive[/unclear] the names

I am not clear that thou wilt publish the lively letter
pretty much addressed to me it exhibits a true picture
of the writer though the subjects are perhaps too important
to obtain publicity whilst the person addressed
exists a poor creature compared to what the path
[unclear]struck[/unclear] out would have lead into. I exceedingly admire
the production, the step to communication with his
beloved [unclear][/unclear] and to be [unclear]punished[/unclear] for his sister, then
to the family so on to E. Cope & T. Lynes - I keep
that in his own hand. but the part to my sister
was I conclude buried. Shouldst thou give it to
print thou wilt not give names -
I value the letter or extract respecting the
Watsons, that was written to my sister and
I should like the World thy Fathers testimony
for Mary Watson - be [unclear]round[/unclear] the divine choice
to love her before she was publikly adorned
with Gospel dignity - I suppose what is stated
of the favoured state of the brothers may be
understood to describe their [unclear]expressive[/unclear] in
sickness and at the approach of death -
our sister Margaret sent me thy letters
could

could it be possible to suppose that I should discourage [underline]editions [/underline]
of the memoirs? no I should rejoice that every rational
being could have frequent recourse to the previous[unclear] volume[/unclear]
I [unclear]presume[/unclear] by thy letter to our sister that the address to
A. Wraghtson is comprised in one beautiful letter - I had
understood the object was to have way of that description
which [unclear][/unclear] would tend to lessen the [deletion][/deletion] the [unclear]craving[/unclear]
for which has been considered so sparingly given forth
I enter very much in thy Various concerns - my beloved
friend and to the utmost of my ability I wish thee
best help and support through all - it is a heavy
weight of care for dear Elizabeth, as [unclear][/unclear] as for th_
I am thy fellow under anticipation about our [unclear]duty[/unclear]
E. C- had threatenings the last week but they
have pretty much subsided and she bequests to [unclear]thee[/unclear]
she will hold up 'till the middle of the [unclear]Week,[/unclear]
thy niece Eliza & cousin Sally White are alike
claimants on the [unclear]accoucheur[/unclear] - Our dear sister Margaret
suffers in her breathing - I feel for your sister Charlotte
& for A & R Widdows - present my love to them
all and to thy dear sisters Lydia & Sarah - our
Mary Hetton seems returning to the World clothed
with a Heavenly spirit. - It looks as if our Valuable
Sarah Watson would soon enter her prepared Mansion
I am in dear love to thee & thine- thy constantly attached
T..S
