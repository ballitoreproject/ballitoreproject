Copy of a letter from Thomas Eyre to Margret Shackleton,
(alias Grubb) from St. Lucia 1779.
My dear Miss Peggy,
Presuming on our former correspondence & long acquaintance,
I take the opportunity of a packet to write these few lines
to you, which if you are not very much altered, I flatter myself will
not meet with your displeasure, tho' I have some right to be diffident
in that idea, as this is the third letter I have wrote to you since I
crossed the Atlantic, & have never had the happiness of an answer.
I assure you I should have imagined the whole race of Shackletons
dead, if my Brother Sam (in a letter I received sometime ago) had
not informed me that you were all well, which information I assure
you most sincerely gave me inexpressible satisfaction - indeed I should
be the most ungrateful wretch in the world, if it did not. I hope no
false prejudice to my situation, or the opinion which I know most
people in civil life have of the Army (& especially the younger part
of them) will prevent you from writing to me, I am just exactly the
same Tom Eyre you knew half a dozen years ago, or less; & [insertion]still[/insertion] will retain the
same love for you, & veneration for your family, which neither time or
climate can alter - the only difference is I am an Officer in the army,
&, (thank God) independent of the World, which I never should, [deletion]have[/deletion]
if I had staid at home poring over the Materia Medica. I gave you
an account in both my last letters of the different rubs I have had on
the rebellious continent of America, but le[deletion][/deletion]st you should not have received
them, which is very probable, as there has been many packets
taken, I shall give a short sketch, which you may draw a great deal
from, as it would take a quire of paper to describe them minutely.
My first attempt was for Boston, but it was evacuated, & very fortunately
escaped the vigilance of a Rebel privateer, by getting into
Halifax, Nova Scotia, a very dismal, cold and & poor country. I immediately
laid hold of a brown musket, & attached myself to the second battalion of
light
