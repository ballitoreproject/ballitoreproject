Anne Elly
Dear Friend,


I have many times thought of writing to thee, but (as they say) friendship hinders Business, so sometimes Business hinders Friendship, or at least hinders its expressing itself as it would.
        We missed thy husband & thee at our quarterly meeting. We heard he was indisposed, should be glad to hear of his being better^recovery +++ I had a letter lately from our dear friend Ruth Follows. She was well, & had been abroad a good deal in her Masters service, in company with Sarah Taylor of Manchester. So there are some still that for Zions sake cannot hold their peace & for Jerusalems cause cannot rest. May you & we, dear Cousins, be qualified by divine Wisdom to fill with propriety the places respectively allotted us! May we be enabled by Divine Power to resist the motions of the grand adversary in ourselves, or we shall never be able to pull down his strong holds in others! We are none of us to be Neuters or Ciphers in the society of which we have been educated members; we would all gladly hope for, & expect the answer & reward of Well-done. Let us therefore, dear friends, diligently attend to know our duty, & endeavour faithfully to perform it: that this may be our joyful sentence & portion at last when these few fleeting, uncertain, weary days of our pilgrimage are over!
