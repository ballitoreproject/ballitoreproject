fulfilling our several departments in life with propriety, & with
ease and satisfaction to ourselves and others. I write freely to
thee, my dear child, because I love thee; because Divine Providence
has favoured thee with a good understanding, both natural
and spiritual; and because thou art now going to leave thy father's
house, and to be the companion of a worthy, a sensible, and a

and comfortable settlement; and having done my duty to the best
of my poor abilities, leave the rest to our Almighty Benefactor
whom I pray to bless you together, with every spiritual & temporal
blessing, which his unerring wisdom sees best to indue you with.
