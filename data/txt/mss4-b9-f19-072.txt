My dear Elizth
I rec'd thy letter this morning still
kindly pressing us to go, but even if the Learletine
did not exist in Ballitore I could not think of leaving
this at present, my mother is here & a nursetender
my mother wholly taken up attending on my
father the boys of course extremely anxious about
him, so that I could not leave any additional
care on any of them, I hope there is no dange
of infection we have made a nursery [unclear][/unclear]
own drawing room so that Margt. is [unclear][/unclear]
quite safe, I will not close this till near post
time that I may say how my father is -
I have not been able to get out to execute
thy commissions, but thou art not impatient
about them so I make few enough to take
my time I have waited till near
post time & have nothing new to tell
of my father we do[deletion]nt[/deletion] not expect a very rapid
improvement & can tell nothing as yet

either one way or another I will
answer thee as to the music & c another
time farewell ever thy affect SB
29 th
I will let you know when a change
for the better takes place
