Turpin begs her Duty to you & love to the Doyles -
I cannot forbear feeling a real interest in poor [unclear][/unclear] welfare,
tell me therefore [underline]secretly[/underline], but tell me [underline]truly[/underline] - does he entertain
the same opinions he did? -

Feb: 19th by some means this Lre was mislaid, & not sent to
Col. Clinton in time -

my dear Friend to answer your letter as fully as I intend,
but as I fear'd you might think me inattentive to your
business (which I think I never shall be) I must tell you,
that the 4th Dragn. Gds. are now at Exeter, & Capt. S. is in
hourly expectation of being order'd to join, as he has already
received directions to hold himself in readiness - He thinks
he shall be more likely to succeed in getting you your Money
by a personal application, than by writing to the [unlcear]Regt.[/unclear], & you
may rely on his best endeavors. As he will have a March
of nearly 400 Miles, & has not yet orders to set off, it will
probably be June before he reaches Exeter - but when he gets
there, he will write to inform you of his success, let the
termination be what it may - I am sorry to perceive
the Q.masters of the 4th Dragn. Gds., are no better than those
of the 22d, & it is perhaps lucky for you that you have a
Friend in the Regt. - In haste, I am most Sincerely Yrs.
I am too much hurried at this moment,
