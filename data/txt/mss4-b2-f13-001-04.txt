Extract from Annals of Ballitore by A.S. 


        My Grandfather had a daughter who had made an unfortunate match in her youth, marrying clandestinely, Maurice R. In those days Betsy used to come to her Father for a few weeks at a time. Consciousness of deviation had induced a gloom over a mind but too reflective from a sharpened understanding, and which had not learned the right application of religious balm; her Father had given her a literary bias, and I suppose she sought refuge in books, which always proves an insufficient substitute when the basis of Christian philosophy, the sources of true consolation were wanting. They may amuse by soothing the wounds which misfortune has made; but have no sanative operation. I can remember my Aunt R. read abundance by day and by night--but as the reading was in a clandestine way, I conceive it was mostly of the lighter kind. I remember sitting beside her, fondling on her lap, playing with her hair, and loving her extremely. I believe she had a good heart; but had suffered much from a stubborn will; not yielding her heart with sufficient ductility to the cultivating hand of Truth. She like many others suffered exceedingly by the intemperate rigour of parental authority. Had the child the entire confidence of her parents mind it is probable this had not happened but wanting the sweet communication of friendship, where nature and grace would conspire to produce them, these were sought elsewhere. A consciousness in the minds of the old people of an ill-concerted system of education made them desultory and inconsistent in their conduct to their children. Her father was guided towards the child by the double principle of the severe coercive measures then in fashion, and a fond tenderness and partiality for her. She had a Son William, who shared the care of the Old Man after her mothers death, and repaid the culture bestowed with correspondent affections.
