Ballitore 2 Mo 10th.. 31.
My dear Sarah
Thou wilt be pleased
to hear of dear Elizabeth being as
well as can be expected over her confinement,
or I may say better:
I wish I could give as good an
account of the child which was
Still born this forenoon at 11 o-clock;
She had a remarkably good time,
was ill about ten hours but not very
ill for more than half the time:
poor Elizabeth! it is a great disappointment
poor Elizabeth: it is a great disappointment
to both, as it was an uncommonly
fine [underline]boy[/underline]: She desires me
to give her dear love to thee, and hopes
thou has not bought the cradle.

Thy Aunt Sally who is Spending the
day with us, joins with Mary in
very dear love
Thine truly
A Wright
I write in haste - we were
very anxious to hear of Edward,
and were relieved by hearing of his
arrival in Dublin, I hope safe arrival;
give my love to him. How are you all
and how is Sally Wright?
Though I have said the disappointment
is a great one to Elizabeth, yet she
bears it very patiently.
