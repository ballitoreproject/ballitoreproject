[unclear]Rockforest 2d[/unclear] of 6 mo; 1817
My Dear Friend
I am sure thou wouldst be delighted
if thou wert with me at Rockforest it is a
delightful spot on the side of a hill about half
a mile from the [unclear]Hous.[/unclear] with a [unclear]bridg across[/unclear]
from that there is a beautiful plantation
up a gentle ascent to the Lodge. The Lake is a
serpentine piece of water which the view of
through the trees is truly picturesque, particularly
when the Swans or other water fowl are
within sight - The enterance is concave with
pretty light Gates and cut stone peers inside
it is [unclear]lushely[/unclear] planted and a neat little Lodge.
the town is extensive and the mountains are
so situated thou wouldst some time think them
very near tho several mils. distant. From
the Lodg to the house I think is about
half a mile of a [unclear]much[/unclear] gravel walk with
small plantations here & there on either
side in one of them is a rustick seat planted
by poor Lydia Smith before She was
married. opposit the hall [unclear]I saw[/unclear] is a group

plot with white pols around it & through
them are chains of Iron painted white also,
in the middle is a mount of choice flowers &
ever green shrubs on one side is a Shrubbry
enclosed by very pretty & very fanciful palisaides
The hall is pretty large paperd with Cottage
paper, on the right hand is the drowing room
very well furnished and on the left is a long
hall leading to the dining parlour the kichen
the back stairs &c &c opposite the hall door
an a flight of stairs very wide and covered
entirely with a carpet a cross the landing
place is a Gothic window opposite which the
sun sets and nothing can exceed the beauty of
it reflected in that window through a plantation
which is behind it, out of the hall
is a door into the gardens which are very
prettily laidout and stocked with fruith
and vegetables, my Aunt is very fond
of flowers of which she has a choice collection
and the green house is exceedingly pretty
The house had formerly been a Castle so I can not
say much about it only the walls are very

thick & it is very comfortable inside The
demain is very well worth a new house which
William indends building if his Wife wishes
when he gets one But I did not tell thee
ther is a very extensive view from a Green
which is in the lawn before the hall door
The wether is so fine since I came I think
every thing looks beautiful a quarter of
a mile behind the house is a large Wood
through which we tooke a most delightful
walk since I came here near the wood is a
rural villag which my Uncle got built
and gave the name of Williams Town it is
exactly at the meeting of five roads which
thee knows is rather an uncommon thing
there are two fairs held there in the year.
on the west is Tenderry the seat of Charles Heasts
a demain of demen of considerable extent plantd
& divided with much taste beond that is Timcony
the fine demain of William Hutchinson
But before I conclude I will tell thee the old Garden[insertion]or[/insertion]
has lived in this family those sixty years &
his son is as none as good as gardner as himslf

and works in the garden also who is the forth
generation of the family
I am thy affecnate Friend
