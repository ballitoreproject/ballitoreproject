Ballitore: 12/8 month 1781

My dear friend,
	I am in sentiment with thee that too free communication genders [sic] to weakness, Gird up the loins of your minds - it is not good to be too lax - When fruit is fully-ripe, let it be brought forth for use. The oven had best be close stopped till the bread is baked, then the break is eatable, and salutary food - but if the oven be often opened, there is danger of the air getting in, the bread when drawn being little better than dough, not fit for mans use, but a waste of what was originally good. If thou hadst felt easy to communicate to me, I would I believe have been pleased with the participation, and perhaps something might have come up in our communing together, which would have tended to enlighten and not darken counsel with words accompanied by a degree of lively knowledge. But thou art such a Recluse, I know not what to do with thee - When we are absent thou hast much to say to me - when present thou art dumb with silence - May the key, the right key of the spirit lock and unlock thy mind, and I am satisfied!
	My stay at Manchester was in some respects very pleasing - I was glad to find myself so favoured as to have the unity of my dear, valuable, old friend Sarah Taylor - she was very free in imparting matters to me - and she dwells so near the spring, and is so sequestered from worldly concerns, so lifted up from earth, that her conversation was very savoury and edifying. The near love which she often exprest [sic] for our Lydia, at whose birth she was, I think, present, and of whom she took a great deal of care in her infancy, was also very grateful to me. John Thorp was my near neighbour - I used to sit and chat by him, while he was at his employment - [page number] 229 he used also to take me pleasant walks - I found him a very sensible, conversible man, of deep religious experience, with whom it was very well worth while cultivating such a degree of intimacy as Truth might open a way for. ++ My intimacy with Martha Routh (formerly Winter) was revived with full force, softened and tendered by a sympathy which arose from particular circumstances +++
