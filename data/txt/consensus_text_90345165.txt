two hours there, rambling about -
We met many parties [unclear]save[/unclear] tho' so

ride, while I worked in the garden,
planting some slips &c &c -
Papa, John Grubb from Clonmel &
Thomas Henry White came out this
evening, so we have quite a full
house - Charlie also joined us at
tea time, having ridden out. I
forgot to say that he had ridden
in this morning after an early
breakfast. Papa brought me out
a long letter from Florence - telling me
of some of their proceedings at Hull -
A wet morning so at least wet
