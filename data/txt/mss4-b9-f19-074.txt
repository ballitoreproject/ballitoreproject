My dear Elizth - the strug[deletion]g[/deletion]le is almost over & we do
not expect it will last longer than to night, since
2nd day the unfavorable symptoms encreased
& my father [deletion]is now[/deletion] grew very rapidly worse
Doctor Gamble thought more assistance than his
necessary & call'd in Doctor Barker & yesterday
evening Doctor [unclear]Baine[/unclear] was was consulted
they did their best for the poor Patient but
nothing would stop the progress of the disease
& they have now all given him up - I believe
it was a spotted or putrid fever, he [unclear]seems[/unclear]
to be quite insensible at present & is given
great quantities of wine, claret, my mother is
patient or strived to be so & the poor girls
wait the event quietly in deep sorrow
the children came in to town yesterday but
went back to Glendruid, the there eldest
boys seem [deletion]the[/deletion] to suffer most [insertion]their[/insertion] kind father
was so much their companion, the
Doctor is most kind unremitting in
his good nature, Connor brought the

basket safe do thou pay him whatever
he wants for carriage as I did not [unclear]see[/unclear]
him to day thank my father for the fowl
how we should prize our parents & take care of them
& cherish them, for their is [insertion]great[/insertion] bitterness when we come
to love them bitterness enough with [insertion]out[/insertion] any [deletion]oth[/deletion]
aggravation from consciousness of neglect
or unkindness on our part
If I can I shall write to my mother
I hope Lydia has not heard of our trouble SB
Elizth. Leadbeater
