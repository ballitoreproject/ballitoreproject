Ballitore: 3/3 month 1768

Dear friend,
	+++ My mother continues to grow weaker, & apparently hastens towards her conclusion. Her the use of her speech seemed for a while suspended, but she recovered it a littleis very patient, but reckoned the old house was long a putting down. Tis true, time seems long ^under^ affliction, but hers [sic] will I believe soon be at an end, & I truest her long life of humility, simplicity & uprightness will be followed with the enjoyment of that fulness of which from her childhood she had often I believe been favoured with the earnest here. This earnest has sweetened many a bitter cup for her in her pilgrimage, & I hope will not fail her in this pinching hour. My father is at times much affected at parting with his old companion, one flesh & of one spirit with him above forty years. It looks as Sam Neale said as if she had nothing to do but to die. Her incapacity of taking almost the smallest nutriment of any kind, by reason of her narrow passage in the swallow, seems hardest to bear by her, & the thought of it very pinching to us.
	thy affectionate friend
