Tullamore 26th of 9 month 1797
Dear William the last letter I wrote to thee was I believe
a cause of uneasiness to thee but this I believe will
be more, my Son my only Son (I cant express myself for
grief) the promising comfort of my Old age is likely
to be remov'd from me, by a severe kick of the fole in
the fore head, the Doctor tells me he may recover but he
Doubts from the appearance of the wound, Brother
Harper gave me half a guinea and wrote by me to the Doctor
and says if there is any appearance of his recovery he'll
get him into the Hospital at present we are at lodgings
give my love to sister Mary, and I remain thy unhappy
afflicted Brother Jn.o Leadbeater
