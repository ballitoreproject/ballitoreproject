My dear Cousin,


        I have suffered thy very kind letter to remain so long unacknowledged, that only I flatter myself I have a more powerful advocate than common civility to plead my cause with thee, I should be afraid of thy having long since charged me with neglect, I may truly say I received thy letter gratefully and had I followed the impulse I then felt, I should have replied to it directly, but, being pretty much engaged I thought I would defer it till I had more leisure, when I might give myself up wholly to thee, this time is not yet come, and I shall not wait for it longer
        It is almost five weeks since I returned with my dear Agatha from our usual excursion to Youngs Bury London &c. I made two separate visits at Bartholomew Close much to my satisfaction, thou canst hardly form an idea of how much I enjoy the freedom of home after being so long deprived of the society of my connections, before the termination of our ^my^ last visit our enjoyment was interrupted by, [sic] the more than usual indisposition of my Mother, I am afraid that she has not yet regained her usual state of health, though they write me that she is much betterMy poor Father continues in good health and generally spends one day in the week with them, thy namesake promises very well so far, and our dear John continues to devote himself to the care and accommodation of others
        I find Norwich and norwich [sic] Friends pretty much in the state I left them in the 8th month last, except that the aged friend Anna Maria Kett and Hannah Oxley (wife of Jo. Oxley) are deceased, the latter died suddenly and left four small children behind her, since that event Mary Oxley has left her own little dwelling and resides with her son, [sic]
        Yes my dear Cousin, I do like to hear of you and the other inhabitants of your peaceful village, I was glad to hear that my Uncle & Aunt Pike had made choice of it for their retreat, There [sic] are some delusive moments in which one cannot help speculating upon future events, when under their influence my fancy always leads me to Ballitore as my last retreat in this worldI hope thy valuable wife enjoys better health than when thy letter was written  Thy account of my dear friend Debby & her family was very pleasing to me, though our correspondence seems suspended, I do not cease to love her and to be interested about herWhat a life of patient suffering poor Hannah Haughton has led!
        My dear Agatha desires me to assure thee of her affectionate remembrance, she continues to grow very tall, above any one I know of her age, and is consequently very thin and delicateThe two younger ones are fine healthy looking children & the delight of a fond Mother
        My very dear love attends thee and thine including thy good Wife, children and Grandchildren though they do not know me, and be assured that whenever thou art disposed to favour me with an epistle, it will be gratefully received
        By thy affectionate & obliged friend & Cousin
                Hannah Pim
