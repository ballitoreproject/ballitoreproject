Richmond 24th of April 1826
My dearest Sister
Received our congratulations for
your & our dear Eban's recovery, who I am happy to
hear is abroad & able to take care of himself. I am
satisfied to yield to him if he desires it that neither
he nor Lydia had any fever at all & was only bilious
he nor Lydia had any fever at all & were only bilious
with eating too many eggs, if he will allow that he
himself was confined to his bed for several days & bled
& so forth & that Lydia was even longer in bed & does
not even yet leave it for more than four or five hours
in the day that she was bled & shaved & is at this present
writing as weak "as a flower borne down by
the gale." We carried her out today in the garden
in an arm chair that we have placed upon two
poles hoping to revive her with the fresh air as she
was extremely weak when she awoke this morning &
has been so all day. She did not leave her bed until
three o'clock. She has scarcely any appetite for any
thing & we are obliged to keep her up almost by force
with chicken broth which she dislikes. She seems to
tire immediately of every sort of food, even what she

relishes at first. I am sometimes discouraged almost
at the slowness with which she regains her strength
She is carried down to the front parlour as soon as
she leaves her bed every day. She cannot walk across
the room without two supporting her. She attempted
to try this evening with my assistance alone & very
nearly fell from weakness. I had to place her back
on the sofa & ply her with hartshorn. I hope however
by degrees she will get on. She saw Joze for the
first time ere yesterday & again yesterday but was too
weak to bear him today. Mary is allowed to appear
in her sight every day. They are both (the children)
in excellent health. We are under great obligations
to Aunt Harvey for all her kindness - her care of
Joze - her old port wine, her cider, her home [deletion][/deletion] made
bread - her every thing that she thinks would be acceptable.
I am very anxious to hear about my
mother, for from Betsey's last letter to Sally I am led
to fear she is growing worse & I dare not hint the
truth to Lydia. I hope I trust that Betsy has looked
at the most gloomy side as she often does, this is my
chief hope. I was quite delighted to see Eben's writing

on the cover of the last Carlow Paper. It was the first
[underline]mark[/underline] of his recovery. Lydia is still far from being able
to put pen to paper. I hope we may promise ourselves
the pleasure of seeing you here in the summer. If not
I fear we must shut our eyes on each other for the
rest of this year - but it will not be so, I expect.
I am reading Crohoore of the Bill Hook one of the
O'Hara Tales. It opens with a horrid [underline]muwther[/underline] - the
sune is in the County Kilkenny & the story very [underline]Irish[/underline]
in the manners, customs & idiom of
the actors as well as in the circumstances
detailed. The White boys [unclear][/unclear]
proctors figure away to some purpose. I hope the
Author will write more to illustrate Irish History
& to embellish & people with his imagination some
of our beautiful & romantic scenery. Tell Eban I
long to see the forth coming Edinburgh Review as it is
to have an article in it on the Banking System - I
seldom think or talk of late finance more except on
Sunday night when Cobbett is served up for supper -
Sunday night! & Cobbett! alas for friends' children!
Lydia's dear love to you & Eban & my mother & father
& Elizabeth in which heartily joins Yours ever IIF
