My dear friend,


        I by no means forget that our epistolary intercourse stands at my door  I have thee often in my thoughts  I remember the very short space of time that I had thee last under our ^my^ roof, & I remember that it was not quite to my satisfaction  I hardly ever think when thou leaves [sic] my house that I have entertained thee as I wished  I mean that I have not had a satiety of that communication with thee, which does the spirit good. Times & seasons not being in our control, personal interviews are sometimes neither so pleasing, nor profitable as visits which are reciprocally paid, in spirit, when the bodies are absent from each other  Nevertheless I have experienced a singular gratification in conversing with thee, & I hope for a renewal of such opportunities  I presume that this will be handed to thee in  the scene of thy checkered fortunes, & probably the publick stage, on which Infinite Wisdom intends thee to act the most of thy future part in life. With the anxious, earnest, constant solicitude of a near friend I desire that thou may^est^ be rightly instructed in thy proper part, & that the good principles prompter may be ever near to assist & supply. Thou hast been a conspicuous character in that place, & many eyes besure are upon thee for good  perhaps some for evil  [pencil note] X [end note] I know no better way for us, in order to answer the just Witness in all, than to lose our own wills in the unfathomable will of our Creator, which is indeed a great deep. Let us be resignedly & submissively content not only to be any thing which he would have us to be, but also to be as nothing in the sight of ourselves & of others; remembering that it is God which worketh in us both to will & to do of his good pleasure, as saith the Apostle, & proceeds, That ye may be blameless & harmless, the sons of God without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked & perverse nation, [page number] 122 among whom ye shine as lights in the world: holding forth the word of life.  I find thou & my dear friend E. P. were companions at Youghal  That season has been spoken well of  May we be enabled, dear friend, to live in our respective, solitary, little dwellings, so feelingly retired, learning of the husband at home, that we may experience a growth in good & in a capacity to do good  If we thus live & learn, diligently reading in the book of spiritual knowledge, we shall witness that day unto day uttereth speech, & night unto night sheweth knowledge  we shall know an improvement in things appertaining to the divine life  and particularly, if any have been exercised in publick labour in a religious line  if any have apprehended themselves influenced to speak in the sacred Name  it would be well for such, as much as possible (especially while yet in a growing, not full-grown state) to avoid mixing in company immediately after; but rather hasten home, & thee consult the husband at home, whether he be pleased or not. It is an indubitable truth, that it is good to be faithful; & that wilful disobedience causes a long wilderness  but yet reverential Fear as well as Love of their Master is becoming in his servants  & there is a diffidence, as well as a confidence, which is acceptable to Him  The searcher of hearts knows every secret thought that lodges there, & the latent springs of action & repugnance to action in us  & we do not find that he disapproved of the conduct of Gideon when he repeatedly (though reverently & resignedly) requested proofs of his mission.
