a little fire place -
table and seat which
however is quite long
enough to hold six at
least, one I think
would find it lovely
enough. On returning
towards the house, Jane
Hill brought us over
a pretty bridge into a
field nearly covered
with linen bleaching
and round which winds
a pretty walk - Here we
saw a very large bee
hive built on the new
fashioned place I think
fashioned plan I think
containing several different
hives, which we could
see into by going behind
