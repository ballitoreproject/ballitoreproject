Ballitore 18th of 7th mo 1821
My dear Elizabeth
I dont know whether I am the first to tell
thee of a little tour my father & I took in the Kings
County - last first day week in the afternoon we left
Ballitore & went to Rathangan there took tea with
A Knott & slept at Isaac Gatchels that night about
4 miles farther than Rathangan Sarah Gatchel
is a lovely, little creature M A LaBatt has left
Betsy from some little disagreement between them
which I hope will soon be made up; on 2nd
day morning we set off at 7 o'clock for Ballyfow
to French's tenants where we breakfasted on [unclear]strinabowth][/unclear]
& reach'd Kilduff about 12 oclock: we found
poor old Roger with a night cap on & unshorn -
he look'd very badly & was very feeble on his
limbs Barbara looks old too [deletion][/deletion] their cousin Anne
North a maiden lady made some variety for
us - she is past the bloom of youth but very
lively, cannot walk quite so far as I can & is not
I believe much above 40 o just as we were going
to dinner in walk'd a tenant of Roger's a half

pay militia officer who has travel'd a good deal
in England & highly extols that favour'd country
after dinner we walk'd about the domain of Thos Cuff
who bought it from Roger a highly improved spot,
the owner changed its name from Kilduff to Thostown-
town - we were all to go to bed early, & we arose
early next morning & went to breakfast with Peter
in Kilbeggan Georgina not in the least alter'd & the
children a little bigger & a good deal better than
they were: after breakfast Peter show'd us the way
to the wonder of these parts the moving bog, it
was pleasant to have Peter along with us, as well
as very useful, as he explain'd the nature of the
wonder to us, brought us to what we conceived
to be a bog so completely was it cover'd a great
tract of land belonging to some of the Clibborns
we stood on what had been a hill but it appear'd
level with the plain, it is thought a great accumulation
of water under the bog caused it to burst, &
thus give[deletion]s[/deletion] itself out into a complete river of sludge
which moves rapidly, Some think that the bog will
exhaust itself in this manner & then will sink
again at present at a distance it looks like a hill

Many have suffer'd in the loss of their land but one
elderly man in particular, who had been for 50 years
adorning [insertion]& improving[/insertion] his domain, is almost in despair & when we
were there expected nothing but that his house should
have been cover'd or nearly cover'd, as the surface
of the bog was 24 feet higher than the foundation
of his house; we have not heard since whether
the house is destroy'd, but hope another [unclear]course[/unclear]
has spared it. I suppose the newspapers tell a great
deal about but I should not stay there too long
we return'd to dine with Roger, bringing Peter along with
us, & after tea accompanied by a few [unclear]gassoons[/unclear] I ascended
Croghan Hill & saw Jenny's burying ground & St Patricks
well John Flanagan & his wife follow'd us up, he still
thro' mere politeness as when I had call'd at their
house for a guide they [deletion]to[/deletion] had not return'd from
the fair of Tullamore: on 4th day morning we left
Kilduff at 6 o'clock accompanied by Flanagan
to Philipstown, he rode close beside the chaise
4 miles & when there was not room enough on the
road way then he took the ditch we breakfasted
in Philipstown at an Inn & then proceeded to [unclear]Goodhill[/unclear]
visited the church yard there to see my aunt's tomb & the
school house to see the little Murphies who look very

we saw [unclear]Bell Byrne[/unclear] & a wee infant of her own [insertion]we[/insertion] then
bent our course to Bloomville where we met [insertion]John &[/insertion] M A
& 2 fine boys a third we went to see to its nurses
house we spent that day there & the next saw us
safe at home after an absence of 4 days & a half
Now I may say what I suppose my mother is at this
moment writing to thee that My father mother Deb
Lydia RSL E Gough & S Wright are as happy as the
day is long at the Vale of Avoca my mother
took pen & ink intending to write from that to her
I never thought that expedition would take place
Betsy & Mary [unclear]have[/unclear] about mind the School for EG
M & A Doyles dear love to thee their } ever thine SL
eldest born - Ah I beg pardon for the [unclear]wobbled[/unclear]
writing I hope I shall have more time for the
next letter I have not a creature here but servants
aunt S is out & we wash while the coast is clear now
dost thou not envy me this wash I will let others tell
events of J Fisher & Lydia ever thine
