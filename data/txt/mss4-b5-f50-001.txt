My dear friend,
As thou seemed to have a desire
that we should renew our correspondence, & as I know
that it will be very agreeable to me to do so, I take
the liberty of beginning the attack.
I am very well pleased with my lodging here. Ellen
Grubb is a kind attentive woman, & as yet I have
spent my time [underline]very[/underline] agreeably since I came to town.
You were very glad, to be sure, to have Lydia among
you again, & we on the other hand were sorry to part
her. she is very much liked by those who know her
here, & we often think & speak of her. Tell her I
wont forget to write to her, but I have made a rule
to write one letter every week, & her week is not come
yet. Edward Alexander has not yet returned, he is expected
daily.
The private course of lectures begins to-day & in
the course of the day, I expect to be introduced by
Joseph Humphreys to the anatomical & chemical professions.
I often go to see Mary Chandlee, & almost
every time I [underline]know[/underline] & consequently [underline]like[/underline] her better.
The death of the deservedly lamented Princess Charlotte
has spread sorrow & dismay over the kingdom.
perhaps, in some degree over the world. [deletion]She was[/deletion] [insertion]Her remains were[/insertion] to be

interred last night, in consequence of which all the shops
in the city were ordered to be shut. Friends, I believe,
in general did not obey this order, which I think they
[deletion] [deletion]might[/deletion] not only consistently [insertion][underline]might [/underline][/insertion] have done, but should have
done. Samuel Bewley said that if he had a shop
he would shut it, which I was glad to hear.
I suppose thou saw & was pleased with Jacob Harvey's
letter to me. & also the extracts from one to James,
which I sent to Mary Shackleton. I confess, he has
cooled my ardour, & [underline] loosened[/underline] my attachment to America,
by facts &[insertion] second[/insertion] reasoning, which i think, scarcely
any of my numerous adversaries have employed against
me. They have generously been contented with
me. They have generally been contented with
assertions without proof. & abuse without foundation.
I am rejoiced to hear of my master's success, [deletion]in[/deletion]
[deletion]his[/deletion] May he & Mary enjoy many happy days together!
Does Lydia even look into a Latin book
now, if so, I shall expect some translations from
her shortly. Any account from Betsey lately?
Mary Shackleton informed me of the melancholy
news which thou had from Julia Smith. We have
had very many warnings of late; sufficient, amply
sufficient if we would attend to them, to teach us
wisdom. Hast thou heard from Melesina on any
of thy correspondents lately?
how does Deborah get on? I hope she rides pretty

constantly . Give my love to her, & tell her she may
expect a letter from me soon.
As this is my first letter to thee since my arrival,
please excuse its shortness. With love to all
my Ballitore friends
I remain thy affecte. friend
Thomas Fisher.
Mary Chandler desires her love to thee.

Mary Leadbeater
