Selby 2 Month 1st:1754
Dear Cousin
      Thine of 20th: 12 month I received the 8th: Ultimate a few Days after my wifes delivery of a fine Lusty Girl which seems thriving & likely to live and thro the Kindness of providence shes been favourd with an extraordinary good recovery.

      I believe all thy relations here were much concernd on thy sisters Account having had too much experience of the like Circumstance in Poor Sister Todd, (whose Child is living, and a fine healthy Girl) But Father holds no correspondence with James, as he came into the family surreptitiously by his Conduct in many Respects hath been very disagreeable not only to him but poor Sister, who is now releasd from many Troubles & Exercises She laboured under (on Account of her imprudent Marriage) and there is Room to hope she finished well

      I sent thy Love to Father & Rest of our Relations at York who are in usual health, also Father writes me he was about to have sent Uncle another Letter, but thine being satisfactory, shall forbear till Uncle writes: He desires his Dear love together with Brother Willys, Aunt Fords & Cousin Hamm to they self & family, Uncle & Aunt and says its likely Willy may pay you a visit next Summer, he having dropt Correspondence with his Friend Miriam as I suppose Father does not approve of it-

      Brother & sister Webster live in the house we dwelt in & seem very agreeable to each other & nothing appears but mutual love betwixt us which I hope will Continue & subsist amongst us - - - -
      And Dear Cousin can assure thee, thou art not forgot by us & shall be well pleasd to keep up so agreeable a Correspondence, the Remembrance of thee, having been many times satisfactory to us. I intended to have writ thee on my Dear Wifes Recovery, hadst thou not favourd me with thy kind Letter to which: I had wrote thee : a Direct answer if I had ^not^ waited in hopes of giving thee the above Account which (Im no ways doubtful) will be very grateful.
      I have not seen Sally Atkinson, since thou wast here, but Brother Webster met with: her about two weeks ago at The Funeral of a Friend who tells me shes recoverd Her Health & Speech She Appeard both in Prayer & Testimony, which to him seemd satisfactory so must leave the issue.
      I desire when thou sees or writes to A. Balfour, thoull remember me affectionately to him, & tho Ive not been favourd with a Line from him, yet mayst tell him Im glad to hear of his Welfare
      Father Carbutt Brother & Sister Webster, my Wife & Son Roger join in Dear Love to thy whole self Uncle & Aunt (tho to them unknown)
      			
Thy Loving Kinsman
Edward Carbutt

P.S.
I shall be glad at all Times to hear from thee when anything offers worthy thy acceptance shall be sure to acquaint thee.
