Dear & honoured Father

	Thy kind & affectionate letter we received for my part I sincerely wish to reduce thy advice into practise, I know of my self I cannot do it, nor any good thing am I capable of, but as I endeavour to be assiduous in seeking for divine help to preserve me from wholely [sic] falling away from a sense of good, & in this great point I know & am conscious I am deficient one trifling thing or other engaging my thoughts & hindring [sic] my longing as much as I ought to do for daily bread; I think I was once in a better state, I am certa^i^n I felt more satisfaction & joy in my mind, but how to attain it again as I could wish I know not; I ardently wish at times not to be totaly [sic] unworthy of the mercys [sic] of God, but indeed I can say, I am one of the least in my Fathers [sic] house, not worthy the pains (my dear Father) thou hast taken with me, I write this in tears, sensible of the mercys [sic] of my creator, & of my own ingratitude, ^in^cability [sic] I want & proper conduct: I cannot help expressing the very sentiments of my heart to thee, & I hope thou wilt ^not^ esteem this liberty want of respect, I know I am writing to a tender Father, & so I write on just as I think.
	Cousin Mary Pim is with us to day, Aunt is just risen out of a fit of the head ache, which confined her to her bed all yesterday, the rest of the family all blavely [sic].
	Poor Joanna came here seventh day night (she went first to the Mill) extremely fatigued, & the man she said complained hard at having to come up that hill again, she seems in great distress, & humbled more than when she was here before.
	Please Give my Duty to Mother & Grandfather one of us should have wrote to Mother, but as thou desired me to write to thee every post thought much more writing needless. I would be glad thou would keep this letter to thy self.
	Aunts love is to you. I am thy dutiful daughter
