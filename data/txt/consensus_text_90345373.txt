Papa, Mama go to town. Uncle Manliffe ill. Loss of the Arctic
13th.. Papa and Mama went to town this morning
calling at Glendruid to enquire for Uncle
Manliffe who has a feverish attack, he
is much the same way. There is an
account in the papers of the loss of the
Arctic on its way to America, and I am
greatly afraid poor Malohr Day and his
family are among those lost, as I believe
he was on board.
14th.. Papa had such a cold this morning
he staid in bed till after breakfast, it
did not however prevent him from going
out [insertion]for[/insertion] which I hope he will not be the
out [insertion]^for[/insertion] which I hope he will not be the
worse. They are very busy getting
out potatoes now, this fine weather is
so favourable for such work. Philip
having gone to the fair at Carrickmines
went on to Glendruid to enquire for
Uncle Manliffe who was a little better to day.
Mary Gough sent me a note answering
one Papa sent to enquire, [underline]She[/underline] says there
is a decided change for the better - and
laments the loss of Mahlon Day, his family - I wd.
[unclear][/unclear] as the other boats may not be lost
October.
