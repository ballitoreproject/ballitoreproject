Richard Shackleton to Deborah Christy
Ballitore 29th of 7th month 1759
Dear Cousin, 
+++++Tis very agreeable to thy friends that thou art situated in a family so agreeable to thyself. I had no doubt but it would prove so, & thy looking at that weighty affair of transplanting thyself by marriage into that place, in the manner thou didst & thy consenting to it without being blind to the dull side of things it, has often been the subject of my contemplation, & raised in me a sincere esteem of love for thee; which I pray in my heart may ever grow between us & that which ^what^ in our solitary moments, we have sown in tears we may ^in due time^ reap with joy. Egypt was a land of darkness in general, when the Israelites there had light in their dwellings. ++
thy truly affectionate friend & kinsman,
        Richard Shackleton
