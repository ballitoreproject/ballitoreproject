lodgings we returned to see the exhibition
where we were met again
by Jane Hatton and a sister of hers
named Elizabeth, Hannah White
and J Carrol and his mother.
Lizzie Coventry had gone home
as she had got her foot wet
on getting out of the boat at Queenstown.
The exhibition was larger and
nicer than I expected - the
organ which was there was
one that had been in the Crystal
palace - We staid there till
near six and then returned to
our lodging where a good dinner
was very acceptable to our hungry
mouths. Took tea at John
White's where we met our
morning's company again.
Came away early as we wanted
to write letters - having spent
altogether a very pleasant day
