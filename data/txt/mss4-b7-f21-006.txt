I cannot defer telling you my dear Friend
What I know will rejoice your tender
heart - Mrs. Rawdon is [underline]thoroughly well,[/underline]
& the happiness of herself & Husband is as
perfect as you can wish it.
We [underline]certainly[/underline] remain here, & I think
have a chance of being [unclear][/unclear] Tenants for
the ensuing 12 months, if we do not go to
England, & we have no [unclear][/unclear] on that subject
to day - Yrs. very Sincerely
[unclear]JM[/unclear]
I return your Book my dear Friend, as I had it before from your Brother
not the less thanks are due to you! I want to see you sadly, & called on
Friday [unclear]Eve.[/unclear] in hopes of tempting you to walk with me - but on peeping in
at your Window, I saw your room nicely swept & set in order, but not
the Friend I sought for - : I had intended this Mond. to have begg'd you to
let the Children come in the Eve. & we [unclear]wo'd.[/unclear] shake the plumb tree to them.
but I fear it will be too wet, & Louis is feverish & unwell - Will you
send & get some? they are quite ripe - perhaps you will kindly call
upon me, & if you are not fearful of the damp bring the Babes, tho' I
wd. not wish them to see Louis - I am Yrs. very Affectly.
I told you we shod. have no rain, [unclear]till yr.[/unclear] Husband
had done working in the Water - }
[unclear]JM.[/unclear]
