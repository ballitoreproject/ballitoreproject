Waterford 4th of 6th mo 1828-
My Dear Elizabeth,
My Mother having very
recently concluded attempting to be with
you at your Monthly Meeting on sixth day
the time being now too [unclear]truncated[/unclear] to admit
of any other conveyance than that of tomorrow
evenings mail we have taken our seats
therein for Ballitore whither my cousin
R: Watson proposed accompanying us: this is
a formidable undertaking for my dear
Mother on many accounts - & understanding
the coach does not reach the inn till
after one oclock I have to request thou
will be so kind as to use thy influence
to have [deletion]for us all[/deletion] the house open for
us when the Coach may arrive & three
dry, comfortable beds prepared, two in one
Chamber - we shall not require any other

refreshment save a little warm water -
- from this thou will conclude that
my mothers health is some what improved
tho she appears to have taken a little
fresh cold in riding out yesterday - we
have almost wintry weather - I know
my dear Elizabeth thou wilt not call
this little commission trouble - & doubt
not thy seeing that the sheets &c are
fresh aired - as it will be too late to
make any examination for ourselves - my
Mother is far from stout it is long since
she changed her bed. & there seems considerable
risk in the plan we have arranged -
but she felt herself attracted towards your
M:M on her way to Dublin whither she
expects to proceed on seventh day by one of the
Carlow day coaches, with the view of attending

a few meetings [insertion]there[/insertion]. Many changes have
occurred since we visited Ballitore - yet the
thought of spending a few hours with thee &
some other dear friends [deletion]there[/deletion] is pleasant
I have scribbled these lines most hastily
& have only time to write my Mothers love
with that of thy affectionate friend
Jane Watson
mention our intention with our love, to
our dear friend E Barrington &c.

Elizabeth Leadbeater
