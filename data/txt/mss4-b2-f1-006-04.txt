My dear James,
        +++ I often think of you in that city (Cork), and at times in my measure suffer with you. May the faithful be preserved faithful to the end! Remember the wo to those, who take counsel, but not of the Lord, & that cover with a covering, but not of his Spirit. Therefore may ye be enabled to put on Christ, & to be covered with his meek, passive, long-forbearing spirit, which in the end shall have the victory - No weapon that is formed against it shall prosper, & every tongue that shall rise against it in judgment, it shall condemn "This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord, & their righteousness ^[in pencil] is^ of one, saith the Lord."
