4/ Bassinghall street 20. 5. 1824 -
My dear friend,
I don't like to let this frank go off without
expressing thy acknowledgments to thee for thy kind letter or letters to
my dear Sarah, with which (as I have heard through one of her most
intimate friends, now in town) she was extremely gratified. - Though I
cannot but deeply feel the privation which a suspension of intercourse
with her occasions, yet I must gratefully acknowledge that the kind
& cordial behaviour of her friends to me has done as much
possible towards alleviating that pain which nothing but anxiety for
our mutual happiness would have induced them to inflict. - If thou
shouldst feel inclined to favour me [insertion]also[/insertion] occasionally with thy letters they will
be very acceptable. I took Sarah's brother [unclear]Rickman[/unclear] to breakfast yesterday
morning with the Shackletons, & he seemed much gratified with their
company - We talk of going there again to-morrow.
I have received much kindness since I came to London from various
persons, & among them from that great woman who is kind to [underline]all[/underline] Elizabeth
Fry - [underline]I request thou wilt let no one see this but thyself[/underline]
In haste thine affectionately
Thomas Fisher
