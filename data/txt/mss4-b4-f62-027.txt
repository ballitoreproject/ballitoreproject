In a dullish mood, that I do not like to feel
myself in when conversing, in any way, with thee,
my beloved sister, I begin, phaps I may improve
my beloved sister, I begin, perhaps I may improve
before I end, – I am sure I wish I may in [underline]every[/underline]
[underline]sense of the word.[/underline] Thou knows I went on 1st day
afternoon to the country, with Betsy Bewley, the time
there past agreeably, we went in the morning of 2nd
day to Dunleary, where I viewed the sea &c: &c: to
my satisfaction, – after dinner several of us went to
tea to Joseph Sandwith's, & on third morning we
returned to Dublin to meetg., the prospect of having
thee [underline]there[/underline] before me was consoling, & settling
down & having two days snug together pleasant: –
thy seat was vacant in the galery, I concluded
in my mind something ail'd little Margaret
& quieted myself: I was not long settled till another
tribulation came over me, I struggled, I feared &
hoped, till at last I got to resignation to venture,
I know not what John Smithson &c: thought of it,
but I know he did not give me his hand; & I
learned from Rachel before I left my seat of [underline]thy[/underline]
sudden departure, & dear brother Saml.'s Providential
escape from the hands of wicked men, wch.
I think [underline]they[/underline] must be, who could treat [underline]him[/underline] so unkindly.
I left Dublin on 5th day, after giving Anne
a sweet warm kiss in bed: – When I came home, here
was Joseph Rickman in the easy chair by the parlour
fire

fire, it was his bed-chamber also, & looked very uncomfortable; –
he had been speaking an abundance in meeting
that day, which I did not regret having miss'd –
On 6th day Abram took him on the jaunting-car
to Sallens, from whence he went to Dublin: – he
seems a poor afflicted man, disorder'd in body, & I
apprehend mind also. I expect these lines will be
handed thee in Waterford by our dear Fanny Bewley,
who diffidently goes to attend your QM. Long since
I wrote to Margt. Hoyland, intending to send by Betsy
Jacob, Betsy did not go since, & dear Margt. to appearance
was near taking her flight to a place of rest &
peace, but this loss to us (it's like) is protracted: – I
would be obliged to thee to remember me in the
[underline]most affectionate manner[/underline] to her, & to tell her that
the lines she will perhaps get from me, if she has
not already, were written before her illness. My
eyes are getting worse & worse, which must plead
my excuse for writing both worse & less than
I have inclination for. Dear love to you all,
& to my friends who may remember there is such
a poor creature as thy sincerely affectionate
Griece-bank:
10th month 1810.
