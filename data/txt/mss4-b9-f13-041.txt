My dearest Sarah
No sooner is one debt paid than I begin
fresh by incurring another - for this letter is to be
filled with commissions if not too burdensome on
thee to execute. I suppose you are all busy with
the approaching marriage & that thou wilt have but
little rest between that & the meeting - Ah dear Sarah
when shall I see thee again, I often long for a few hours
conversation with thee - a few hours. how little we
thought of the countless hours we passed together in our
girlhood - how little we dreamed of longing for even five
minutes chat or for a few hours to talk & weep over together
our many griefs & changes Dear Deborah's loss presses more
& more heavily on my mind unlike other afflictions I think
the more familiar it is the more painful it becomes, & I feel
as though if I had seen her at all lately I could bear it better
for her image would be more distinctly impressed on my mind
but no! I never can forget that sweet pallid face. It is now
exactly 2 years since I parted her indifferently & carelessly
& that for ever. Give my dear love to Edward, I hope
he is quite well & that this severe
weather has not given him
the usual Spring attack, which
I had hoped might have missed
its turn by visiting him in the 11.th month for he was very
poorly when Leticia came. I wish earnestly you would
continue to billet the bairns & come both of you & bring
Margaret early this summer & leave her with me, for I
expect to be a close house keeper all this year & I would like
dearly to form an acquaintance with my dear little niece
beside as I expect Sally will be visiting most of the summer
I shall want her for company. Dear Sarah do give me this
gratification. Consider how uncertain is our stay here to please
or comfort one another. I thought to have written to thee by
the More's but they hurried so at the latter end that I could
9.th. I have only time for a few lines more for I am in
all the delights of painting etc. etc. I will be much obliged
by the enquiring what the best Chintz calico for furniture
is by the piece - also the best sort of tarpauling for halls
[underline]without a border[/underline], as our hall must be exactly fitted -
Also stair carpetting, for all these things are dear here
beside a bad vanity for choice & I want all this summer
& I would then calculate - would it be worth my while getting
them from Dublin as boat carriage is cheap - The stair carpetting

need be only 5/8 wide. I want the calico
for curtains for the best room two
beds.
how did I
make this mistake
no matter
I will be extremely obliged by thy writing by post to
tell me about these as I am busied [unclear][/unclear]
all new. & I have partly fixed on Chintz as being
most in vogue now for curtains, & fades less
quickly than mureen - We are all well & pretty
hearty - this is good friday & James is
spending the day at home - Is Elizth presenting
to day? I shall be expecting a full
& true account of Lucy's wedding from thee
& Selina [insertion]to[/insertion] whom is my dear love - Tell
her Dr. Griffin, [underline]not[/underline] Ian, is going to be married
to a Miss Hunt niece, no, first cousin of Sir
Aubrey De Vere's, & that Lucy is in town getting clothes
& was here yesterday talked & Selina & bade me
send her love when I wd. be writing. Have you read the
Christian Physiologist - it is a delightful work
Mary Mere is finely. Ever my dear Sister thy [unclear]LJF[/unclear]
Sarah
