thee from my son Jacob which
I received this day by a Vessel
which is just arrived from New York,
& which he left unsealed for his
Mother's & my perusal -
If thou have no objection, I
request thee at thy leisure to
transmit it to our Representative
in Parliament, who is a particular
friend of mine & of Jacob's, and who
will return it safely to thee
Direct to Thomas Spring Rice Esq

Most of its contents will be interesting
to him. - If James Joseph Fisher been in

My Wife unites in love to thee
