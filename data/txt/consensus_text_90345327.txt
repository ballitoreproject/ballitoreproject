[insertion]X[/insertion]31st,, Margt went in this morning and
Liddy and I saw her off. then went to
bathe for the first time this year. The
sea was very inviting and we quite enjoyed
long before tea and after it Papa
and Mama came out ; having returned
Dublin at four.
August 1st,, Liddy and I went to bathe
and then for the first time went on
the new railway to Dalkey as we wanted
or rather I did, to go see Charlotte Pim.
She was in bed when we called so we
went to De Vesci lodge to see Maria White
who is there now helping Anne Webb to
mind M E Webb -. We then returned
and I found Charlotte ready & dressed
in her bed room. Poor Charlotte she
is greatly altered even since last I saw
the dip. I took a ride not
