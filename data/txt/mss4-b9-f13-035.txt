Richmond 27th of 11th month 1828
My dear Sarah. -
I got thy letter in due course but
delayed writing yesterday because of the indecision
of the parties concerning my cloke,
& now I am afraid thou wilt miss Ben, &
I am in dire necessity for a warm article. -
Well in spite of James & Sally. who both
wish for the velvet. I decide for 9 yards of
the 3/8 levantine & the white lining for
enough to line it from the shoulders
down, but not from the throat - so perhaps
that will be cheaper.- The 9 yards will make
me both cloke & bonnet & will come 32s/- cheaper
than the [deletion]fust[/deletion] [insertion]velvet.[/insertion] - that is to be considered.
I shall be greatly oblijed by thy sending it
as soon as thou can.- I make no apology
for bothering thee - & when I am sending
thee a money order I mean to write thee
a longer epistle. The measles are raging
here in town, but they are light - none
of our wee ones have caught it yet. -
I am sorry thou thinks the right time is

not come for My visit - but we must only
look forward. - Wm Todhunter takes
this, & he would often forward letters to me
from thee if thou sent them to him. We
shall miss him greatly. It is a great advantage
to me to send to thee for things
I could not get any levantine under 5/- here
& the good silk & good black is 7/6 so see
what thou saves me.- Thou cheered me
about Eben, for Betsy wrote me such a dismal
account of them. Think of young Lydia
With dear love to Edwd I am my dear
Tell me what I owe for the [underline]last[/underline]
Sarah in great haste
ordered candles, as I can send an order to the whole amount.
