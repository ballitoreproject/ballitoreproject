Clonmel 24 of 4th month 1792


My dear Father,


        I must seem tedious in answering thy two last valuable letters, I may plead, that I was so much in the bustle since my strength returned after confinement that I was not settled for writing, the meeting so soon succeeding that went, & the disorder we got into in consequence of my being confined made some exertion necessary to get into tolerable order for the reception of our friends, who favoured us with their company. & we esteem it such to be able to entertain them, tho in a simple plain way; we had the company of dear E: Penrose to lodge, who is on her way to Dublin, & it is comfortable to be a witness to her encrease in dedication to the good Cause, & there is reason to hope she will be an useful instrument, she spoke a few words in the Womens meeting, which were very acceptable I believe, & being attended with the savour of life as far as I could judge; the meeting is now over, & I believe some were helped by it, my mind was not much refreshed, but I imputed that a good deal to my own weakness & unbelief, I cannot say either stubbor^n^ness ot willful disobedience, but if I had any thing required of me the right time was missed, others were more in readiness, & it tended to my extreme poverty, & ended in many doubts of ever being intended to convey a communication of this sort ot others. Our youths meeting was to day, we had the company of several strangers, & several testimonies were born. Joseph Garrat was there, & said a great deal, twice spoke & once in prayer, Anne Tuke was sweet both in testimony & supplication, Edward Hatton & Joshua White also spoke & Mary Dudley a little, at meeting yesterday she was eminent, she is greatly improved, I expect she will be enabled to evidence it, at your approaching general Assembly
I hope our dear Sally got well home with you, I am much obliged to you & her for her company & assistance, which came in the needful time, when she went I was but feeble, & was afraid I should remain so a while, but tho I might seem to strain a point in exercise about preparing for the meeting yet I seem to have gathered strength, & I believe the exertion did not hurt me: our poor little Robert was very indifferent at the time of the meeting, I suppose teething, but it was cause of anxiety & care to me, little Thomas is thriving, tho a little uneasy & cross at times, the other children seem well, Sam is indeed an active perplexing boy at times, & requires much looking after, Richard Abell came in a little while since & desired his love to thee & my Mother
I was obliged by thy leaving open thy very valuable letter to Mary Dudley, she gave me the perusal of it since, & I think it was an extraordinary epistle, many have been favoured with having it at this meeting I believe, it would be a pity to conceal such a communication. It is very agreeable to hear our dear Mother got to Mountmelick her thus moving about to ^meeting is^ quite useful to herself, as well as to others to have her company, & I hope she will get with thee to Dublin meeting, I am concerned to hear thy eyes are but poorly: & think it long since I saw thee, I think thou art unusually long without paying us a visit, I have not heard whether thou intends for London, suppose thou doest as usual, being so much wanting there.
        Altho I expect my Husband to see you in Dublin yet having an earlier opportunity per our dear H: Davis I conclude, & with dear love conclude ^remain^ your
        affectionate daughter
                Margaret Grubb
