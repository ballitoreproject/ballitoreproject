a publick meeting at Hackbridge, the village
near where Thos.. Reynolds resides; but knowing
my aversion to those meetings, she put
by her feelings: - she added a little, which I
deserved, but principally blamed herself for
her disobedience: - her distress of mind was
great; I felt myself much to blame, & resolved
to avoid as much as in my power,
ever throwing out the least [insertion]hint[/insertion] which might tend
to the discouragement of her humble dedicated
mind, the little remaining time I am to be
with her. 3rd.. 10 miles to Wandsworth, to meeting
where were married Thos.. Jeffery & Mary Coleman:
-much said:- three friends, in that way,
from London: came after dinner to T Reynolds.
7 miles: a place prepared, & neighbours invited
perhaps about fifty or sixty came: & I trust
dear S:T's exercised mind got relieved: Hannah
Reynolds prayed. Lodged at their house,
as heretofore. 4th.. Their weekday meeting at Croydon,
which we attended in our way to London,
where Robert Moline accompanied us
in the evening, 10 mile. 5th.., prepared for
setting out again. 6th.. John Eliot kindly
