Dear Friend
When I just [unclear]cribled[/unclear] & fill,d up the chinks of my compani[insertion]ons[/insertion]
letter to thy Brother I did not recollect that the friend the bearer of.
this live,d any where near & could readily take a letter or two. & so in
great care not to put him to much charge for what might be so little —
worth fill,d & that which was intended for the Post Yesterday but now
is laid by, to go by Joshua Eaves.
Well my Dear Friend dont apprehend that I forgot
thee & the expectation I gave thee of writing for that was not the case
Thou hast often been brought very near me, & particularly one morning when I
was at Springmount I rose by candlelight & wrote a good bit of what I felt in
my heart but being call,d down to breakfast before I had half emptied my
budget put it in my Pocket & another time reading what I had wrote thought
it not worth thy acceptance, It is a great comfort & strength to ones mind
in low & trying reasons to feel the love of the Brethren because it is the true
mark or badge of decipleship. "By this shall all Men know that ye are my
Deciples if ye love one another." & I believe this mark is not mere evidently seen
any where than in this highly favoured Land & believe it was in a degree of it
that my mind has many times been brought very [insertion]near[/insertion] to thee, thy Parents & Family
& esteem it a great favour to have a share of your Love & a place in your
affectionate rememberance, & should be glad if in my power to render you any ser[insertion]vice[/insertion]
but alass how little can we do for one=another even at times when we seem to
stand most in need. But as we dwell in this Love we can do the most, & when
it fares well with ourselves, in the expandings thereof reach to one another &
enclose within the circle presented before our Heavenly ' Father, beseeching daily
Bread, strength, & preservation, from all evils both on the right hand & on
the left, & be frequently favour.d to partake of the stresses of that
river which makes glad the whole City & heritage of God. That
sometimes [deletion]after[/deletion] after seasons of deep probation & trial
seems sweet to our taste beyond description. —

I frequently remember thine & indeed all the Familys kindness to me
when with you with gratitude & trust you will not go unrewarded by Him
who has promised that even a cup of cold water should not be ha[insertion]n[/insertion]ded for nou[insertion]-ght[/insertion]
I frequently feel very low seasons, & when at Ballitore particularly
I seem,d so poor, so tried, & so unprofiable, that I seemd less deser[insertion]ving[/insertion]
of the kindness of my 'Friends, or any of the Lords mercies than many
others, Alas, there were intervals in which the light broke through the
darkness & a sweet sense of continued regard & favour vouchsafed to me
humbled my Soul, & enabled me in thankfulness to admire his gracious
dealings with his poor Children & People, In humbling in order to raise
in striping, in order to prepare for the clothing with the white raiment, and
emptying in order to be made fit to be replenish,d & filled with the wine
of the Kingdon & I am ready to conclude that if did not pass through these previous
states of suffering & humiliation we should not be quallified to value these inestimable
privillages & favours we are sometimes permitted to partake of.
And thus I hope we shall be preserved, by the wise, merciful, & varied
dispensations of the Lords unerving wisdom towards us from being elevated
in times of favour, or two much dejected & cast down in seasons of deep [unclear]provin[/unclear]
And learn as the Great Apostle did in all [unclear]seasons[/unclear] to be content. —
We are now at Clonmel, where I feel much im Prison
in Cork for the first few Days, & must leave it how it may be in future hope to go
to Waterford 2d or 3d intend to give you a line whether we go from there or not
The Frd is waiting for this Letter with Dear Love to all as if named
I remain thy affec: Frd
