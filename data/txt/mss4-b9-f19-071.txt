I hope to get the quills for my Aunt tomorrow & send
by R S L along with 2 baskets which W Downes sent here
dont be uneasy that [deletion]the[/deletion] RSL forgot the basket I am
not out of eggs yet & as for the turkey it will keep
well enough to send by the carman tell my
father I am greatly obliged to him for always
remembering me I wish I could go & eat
turkies with yourselves, we have just recd a
letter from Eben from Peckham he is almost
well as good as new as he says himself; they
are doubtful about changing the nurse they are
all thriving TF arrived & brought our letters
they speak of returning in about 6 weeks is not
this delightful, did I forget any of thy commissions?

thou did not answer me about the yearly meeting
I hope thou'lt come & it would be so pleasant to meet
Ed D & the minikin Betsy & all we shall have ample
room for them & if I should want a bed I have only to send
to thee for the feathers thou can get for me that we spoke
of before, but of this another time we have 2 good feather
beds besides our own & the servants & mags: 5 in all
& then at that time we shall have the use of my father
& mother's which is equal to two as there is a
matress belonging to it which E & D may have
I have bought dimity for curtains for a bedstead which
I hope to get a second hand one, so that thou sees
we shall be amply provided & I hope thou
wilt make an effort to come, do not say any
thing of this in answer as Edw says I am such
a gossip that I tell every little thing I can think
of I think what ail'd me was a slight
bilious fever but I can say I am quite
well now, Jane Wms call'd & told me
a deal of news & a deal about your kindness
to her I hope she will succeed - dost thou
or Mary Shackleton want any neat stuff
of a slate colour if thou could take or dispose
of a few gowns we could take a piece among
us it is twice the breadth of common stuff
of a fine texture for 17d per yd there are 28 yds in
a piece 4s 0/- -- worth

I was thinking it would make a nice gown
for cold [unclear]summer[/unclear] days which often occur
perhaps aunt Sally would want a petticoat
thou can do this or not as thou likes I wish
thou would come to the meeting or a little
before it that we might lay in what would be necessary
R S L seems in tolerable spirits not withstanding the fall on
flour, Nurse left us when I was ill she was very ill herself
& I believe left us to save trouble & lest we should send her to a
fever hospital she wrote that she was better since she
went home, indeed she was getting better before she went
Rose answers for Mag very well & Mick is coming on he seems
willing to do what he can, -- Mags head is getting well, I would
thank thee to bag me some eggs as I have frequently to give
them to Mick & Nancy for dinner & do not like giving
your nice fresh ones, thou might send some duck eggs
I am very troublesome but I hope thou'lt excuse it, I long
for the good news from Limerick & am glad my mother
enjoys herself, -- the lard is very nice & very cheap, the
bag at least one bag a very coarse table cloth & two
rubbers were sent in the hamper but perhaps there
was another bag I unpack'd the bed & yet do not remember
more than one bag which was pretty large
& not very coarse, what do they charge in Clonmel
at the school for making infant's caps? Please say
in thy next I intend sending the ladles by RSL
I have scribbled away at a great rate without
much attention to what I have said, I wish you had
a decent servant girl like Betsy B's that you could

trust in the dairy & then thou would be at liberty to go
out a little & slip up here now & then, if I were in thy
place I should be most anxious to get this done, I wish
thou'd consider it & I think my father would be willing
to try it. - this letter is only fit for thyself to see give
my love to my aunt Sally - alas for poor MAT
What a wretched condition she is in it was very kind
of thee to go see her, is she bitter ? I thought it was
to the eldest of the Roe's she was married & that he was
a cooper & could earn something for her but I hear
this is not the case - I hope John F recovers Richd
went to see Jane _
I send a towel of yours
which has lain
here this long time
& a little pocket handkerchief
which I think belongs to
one of the little Whites
it has E Barrington
on it & seems like
the father of one
of Betsy's
I am sorry I have not
the candles to send
the day was so cold I
fear'd to venture
to go buy them
ever thine
SB
how extremely
kind is Melesina
