Georgina spends the evening with us. Betsy Barrington [unclear][/unclear]
come in at all, so to keep us company, I sent
Avy over to invite Georgina to spend the evening
which she did like a good girl. Poor [unclear]boy[/unclear]
had to go out, tho - I think he would just
as soon have staid in. We three, G, C, &I
played at Tiv√≥li and chatted, thus we
spent the evening, pleasantly enough.
x 28th.. Georgina had to be home at eleven
so she went early, I accompanied her
but did not go in. Margt. returned this
morning, and Avy and Papa came in
at eleven tram. I hear William Pike is
at eleven train. I hear William Pike is
going to be married to Lydia Roberts
he is I think well off to get such a nice
young wife. Betsy Barrington is
very ill, Mary White and Anne Webb
went down to her, her friends are expecting
Barrington ! [deletion]B[/deletion] or rather poor Ballytore
for it will feel her loss I think greatly
Papa, Avy, and I came out here by the 9 train
November
to hear of her death, poor Betsy
