Extract from the Will of Abram Shackleton late of

Item, my property in the Farm called Carters
Holding, in the town of Ballitore, I give & bequeath to my
two daughters Elizabeth & Mary: nevertheless my will is,
that they come not into possession till after their mother's
demise; but that they live with her, the rents of said
Farm to be at her control, & for the use of her family
establishment
3rd of 2nd mo: 1826
To Edwd. Maguire
As Deborah Shackleton is going to Dublin this morning
I thot. I wd. send thee the above Extract - Could there be any
harm in reckoning the Interest on J. Christy's Bonds from
1811 a year's Interest is of little consequence in the present
case it is probable if he pays all the Principal & costs
that the Interest will be forgiven - to have the assignment
on Tuesday morning the 7th. Inst. will answer for
P. Fitzsimons to execute & it is not unlikely but he may stay
a day or two longer regulating his auction affairs -
Wm. Leadbeater
turn over

Must the Execution of the assignmt. be proved during Term? Or will
it answer any time in the proper office after term? -
