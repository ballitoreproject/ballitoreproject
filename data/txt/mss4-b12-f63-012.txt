The first excercise was wrestling. A Rhodian of about thirty
five years of age overcame all others who dare stand before him:
he was still in all the vigour of youth; his arms were nervous
& fleshy: at the least motion that he made all his muscles
appeared; his activity equalled his strength. I did not appear
to him worthy of being conquered; & looking with pity on my
tender youth, he was going to draw back, but I offered my
self before him. Then we caught hold & squezed one another out of
breath; we were shoulder against shoulder foot against foot all
our nerves stretched & our arms entwined like serpents; each
endeavouring to raise his adversary from the ground. One time
he strove to surprize me in pushing me to the right side,
another time he endeavoured to bend me to the left. Whilst he
was fumbling thus, I pushed him with so much violence,
that his back bent: he fell upon the sand & dragged me upon
him in vain he strove to put me under him I held him immoveable
under me. All the people cried out: Victory to the son of Ulysses;
& I assisted the confounded Rhodian to get up.
The Combat of the Cestus was more difficult. The son of a rich
citizen of Samos had acquired great reputation in this kind
of combat. All others gave way to him; I alone had some hopes
of victory. At first he gave me such thumps on the head & stomach
as made me vomit blood & spread over my eyes a thick cloud. I tottered;
he pressed me close & I was quite out of breath: but I was
encouraged by the voice of Mentor who cried to me: O son of Ulysses
can you be conquered? Passion supplied me with new strength; I avoided
several blows which would have overwhelmed me. As soon as the Samian
had missed his blow, & his arm was stretched out to no purpose, I surprised
him in this bending posture: now he was giving way, when I raised
my cestus to let it fall upon him with more force: he wanted to slip
away & losing his balance he supplied me with the means of throwing him
down. Hardly was he stretched on the ground but I gave him my hand
[deletion]to get up again:[/deletion] to raise him: he got up himself covered with dust & blood,
his shame was very great but he dare not the renew the combat.

Le premier [deletion]jeu[/deletion] [insertion]combat[/insertion] fut celui de la lutte. Un Rhodian d'environ
trente-cinq ans [deletion]surpassoit[/deletion] [insertion]surmonta[/insertion] tous les autres qui [deletion]l'osoient resister[/deletion] [insertion]oserent se presenter a lui[/insertion]: il
etoit encore dans toute la vigeur de [insertion]la[/insertion] jeunesse; ses bras furent nerveux
& [insertion]bien nourris[/insertion] [deletion]robustes[/deletion]: [deletion]le[/deletion] [insertion]au[/insertion] moindre mouvement [insertion]qu'il[/insertion] faisoit [deletion]voir[/deletion] [insertion]on voyoit[/insertion] tous ses muscles; il
etoit [deletion]aussi actif que[/deletion] [insertion]egalement souple &[/insertion] fort. Je ne [insertion]lui parus[/insertion] [deletion]semblois[/deletion] pas digne [deletion]de vaincre[/deletion] [insertion]d'etre vaincu[/insertion]; & regardant
avec [deletion]compassion[/deletion] [insertion]pitie[/insertion] ma tendre jeunesse, il voulut [insertion]se[/insertion] retirer, mais je me
presentai [deletion]devant[/deletion] [insertion]a[/insertion] lui. [deletion]Donc[/deletion] [insertion]Alors[/insertion] nous [insertion]nous[/insertion] saisimes l'un l'autre [insertion]nous[/insertion] [deletion]&[/deletion] nous ser[deletion]ra[/deletion]rames
[deletion]jusqu' au[/deletion] perdre la respiration. Nous etions epaule contre [deletion]l[/deletion]'epaule
pied contre pied tous [deletion]nos[/deletion] [insertion]les[/insertion] nerfs tendus & [deletion]nos[/deletion] [insertion]les[/insertion] bras entrelassez comme des
serpens; chacun s'efforçant d[deletion]e[/deletion]'[insertion]en[/insertion]lever de [deletion]la[/deletion] terre son ennemi [deletion]Un[/deletion]
[deletion]fois[/deletion] [insertion]Tantot[/insertion] il [deletion]tacha[/deletion] [insertion]essayoit[/insertion] de me surprendre en me poussant [deletion]de[/deletion] [insertion]du coté[/insertion] droit [deletion]coté[/deletion], [deletion]un autre[/deletion] [insertion]tantot[/insertion]
[deletion]fois[/deletion] il s'efforc[deletion]a[/deletion][insertion]oit[/insertion] de me [deletion]flechir[/deletion] [insertion]pencher du coté[/insertion] gauche [deletion]coté[/deletion]. Pendant qu'il [deletion]tan[/deletion] [insertion]me[/insertion]
[deletion]tinoit[/deletion] [insertion]tatoit[/insertion] ainsi je le poussai avec tant de violence que ses reins plierent:
il tomb[deletion]oit[/deletion][insertion]a[/insertion] sur l'arene & m'entrain[deletion]oit[/deletion][insertion]a[/insertion] sur lui [insertion]en vaine[/insertion] il tacha de me
[deletion]sou[/deletion]mettre [insertion]dessous[/insertion], je le tins immobile [deletion]au de[/deletion]ssous [deletion]de[/deletion] moi. Tout le peuple [deletion][/deletion]
cria: Victoire au fils d'Ulyssse & j'[deletion]assistai le[/deletion][insertion]aidai au[/insertion] Rhodien confus
a se relever.
Le Combat du Ceste fut plus difficile. Le fils d'un rich citoyen de
Samos avoit acquiré grande reputation en ce genre du combat. Tous
les autres lui cederent. J'etois le seul qui avoit l'esperance de victoire
D'abord il me donna tant de coups sur la tête & sur l'estomac
que me firent vomir sang & repandirent sur mes yeux un[deletion]s[/deletion] nuage
epais. Je chancelai; il me suivoit de prés: je n'avois plus d'haleine:
mais je fus animé par la voix de Mentor qui m'ecria: O Fils d'Ulysse
serez vous vaincu? La fureur me donna de nouvelle force;
J'evita plusieurs coup dont je serois eté accablé. Aussi-tot que le
Samien avoit fait un faux coup, & son bras s'etois etendu en vain
je le surprenois dans ce posture penchée: deja il retiroit quand je
haussai [deletion]pou[/deletion] ma ceste pour tomber avec plus de force: il voulus
s'echapper & pendant l'equilibre il me donna l'occasion de
le renverser. A peine fut il etendu sur la terre que je tendois
ma main a se relever; il remontra de lui meme couvert de
poussiere & sang, sa honte fut extreme mais il n'osoit renouveller
le combat.

Immediately they began the races of the chariots which they distributed
by lot. Mine happened to be the worst both for the lightness
of the wheels & the strength of the horses. We set off: a cloud of dust rises
& covers the heavens. At the beginning I let the others go on before
me. A young Lacidemonian called Crantor left all others behind
him at first. A Cretan called Polycletus followed him close
