My dear Elizth
I hope to have thy commission ready for the
next opportunity I forgot to pay thee 1..4 for letters
I have 2/2 of thine & when thou hast paid M Wms
2/8 I shall owe thee 6/2 - poor Margt: has
forgotten almost all her letters I have taken her
into my own room for a short time each day since
she came home to try to teach her a little, she
soon tells me that she is tired so that we
make but little progress my mother advised
this plan, - Johnny is very fretful getting [unclear][/unclear]
teeth & does not attempt to speak yet -
Was Ellen Haughton bemoaning the garden?
ah why do you not write about Eben & Lydia
& to tell me about the presintation which I
hope thou wert at - father Molloy was
in the coach with us & most kind in making
room for me & Willie who behaved very well
& suck'd his bottle to the admiration of
the passengers, I suppose G Downes is gone
regular way soon
Ever thy S B
My dear love to [insertion]aunt Sally[/insertion] M Doyle & Abby

or goes tomorrow to the coach, he came
home with us & spent the evening, & on 6th
day we had him & Petrie & Doctor Henry Selina
Emily & John & were tolerably gay - I mean to
write to M A Le [unclear]Prat[/unclear] this evening to know her final
determination S Gatchell wish'd I should do so
& I thought I had gone too far not to follow it up
I am afraid I cannot manage sending our clothes
to Ballitore however I hope to be settled in some
