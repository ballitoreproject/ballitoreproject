Dear Margaret
There was not time
yesterday to tell thee that at a quarter
past 4, yesterday Evening my beloved
Father quietly passed from the cares
and trials of this world to his eternal
rest - most quiet & peaceful was the
close - a signal blessing after all his
sufferings. - Our loss is his gain - &
God has been so merciful to him
that tho' sorrowing, we must not
repine:- Mamma keeps up wonderfully
but I must end - with dear love -
Ever thine. [underline]E A Bentham[/underline]
The funeral is to be [deletion]at[/deletion] on 1st day - to leave this
at 12 1/2 oClock
