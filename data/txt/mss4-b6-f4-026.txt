Author, as we both belong to a literary Club which
meets once a week during the winter & spring.
We number amongst our members some of the most
intelligent men belonging to the learned professions,
and we are generally visited by all strangers of
distinction who pass thro' New York. The topics of
conversation are various, & rational merriment is
not improperly suppressed. We assemble[deletion]d[/deletion] about
1/2 past eight & reparate at 12.- but any person
may come in & go out just as he pleases. One
of our Members, the other day, was appointed Chancellor
of this State, which is the highest legal office, &
two others are Members of Congress. - I was nominated
last winter by my friend John Griscom & was
unanimously elected, which I considered a compliment
than myself, were refused admittance at the same
time. There are about 50 members in all, but
we do not often exceed 20 at any one meeting.-
We have three poets of distinction, Bryant, Hillhouse,
and Halleck, whose names, tho' not much known
with you, stand high in the literary phalanx
of American Authors.- I send herewith a
piece of "Halleck's" on "Alnwick Castle" which
I think displays a vast deal of poetic talent.-
The difference between feudal state, & modern improvements
is admirably exhibited in the satirical
stanzas of this piece which are written with much
spirit. Tell me what [underline]you[/underline] think of its merits.-
Among our visitors a few weeks since was an
American Gentleman who has lately returned from

a five years absence abroad, during which he
travelled thro' Italy, Greece, Turkey, Egypt, the deserts
of Arabia, the Holy Land, France, England, Scotland
& Ireland. He was a very attentive observer, converses
extremely well, & is, consequently, an agreeable companion
He saw a good deal of the Pacha, & received much
valuable assistance from him during his Egyptian
journey. He also visited Lady Hester Stanhope
at her residence among the Arabs, & has brought home
several letters which she wrote to him whilst there.
He says that the Arabs look upon her as a kind
of Prophetess & instead of molesting, reverence her -
What a singular taste she must have to prefer
the company of wild Arabs, to her own connections
in England ! she must possess something of the
[underline]Byron[/underline]- mania!
My friend Randolph has been promoted
by his native State to the [underline]Senate[/underline] of the United States,
but he has hitherto, this winter, been a silent member.
I have not had a letter from him lately, but
when he last wrote to me it was in a cordial style.
Last Summer I gave a friend of mine who was
going to Virginia, a letter of introduction to him
& he was received & treated with great hospitality
at "Roanoke" . -
I am glad to hear so favourable an
account from thee of brother William & I hope he
will continue to merit your good opinion.
I wrote to him last week by the Dublin Packet
& I told him that I must appoint him as my
Representative at the approaching Celebrations in
Ballitore. Much as I wish to mingle with my

contemporaries once more, especially on such an
occasion, it will be out of my power to cross
the wide waters which separate us, this spring &
therefore I shall have to confine my part of the
ceremonies, to pleasing recollections of past times,
& cordial good wishes for the future prosperity of
the "Classic Vale," and its inhabitants.
This time three years ago, I was assisting at the
Wedding of thy Lydia & cousin James F., & now they
have a fine chubby fellow who I suppose can
almost write poetry! so time flies, & thus we [unclear]grow[/unclear]
old, without feeling it!
Lucy Bewley too is married - but stop -
I must not begin to enumerate the list
of Matrimonial changes which have occurred since
I left home, or I shall leave myself no room
to send a message of my kindest regards - to
in fact the whole village - for here, too, the
enumeration of names would more than fill
my paper.-
I need not assure thee that
it will always be a [underline]treat[/underline] to me to receive
an Epistle from thee containing the passing
"Annals" of Ballitore, & I do not intend ever
to let it remain long unanswered, - however
poor my return may be. - Remember me
[unclear][/unclear] the Members of thy own family
& believe me to remain
Thy affectionate friend
