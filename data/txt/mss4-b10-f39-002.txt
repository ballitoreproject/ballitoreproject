St Margarets
June 9th 1917
My dearest
Lydie and Willie
I am creeping on very
slowly, and have been sitting
out for a while in a basket
back chair Lena hired or
bought.  It is a second hand
one and very light - It
was very nice to be out
in the air, but I cannot
 stay long in one position
I got wearied luck I fancy
I am stronger daily tho it
shows very little
I was very glad to get Willie's
letter and much interested
I am full of sympathy with
you both as regards Argent
and think of him constantly
I hope he keeps well and
am glad he has food
enough

and hope he has happened
 upon nice fellow workers.
It would make such a
difference
It is a pity he cannot
take a weekend with
Edwrd & Fanny.
Could we do anything
to enable him to get there.
Would he be able to get a
taxi to take him there
I could pay the expense
for one weekend - .
I shall feel my way.
It would be such
 a treat for him - 
What do you think
about it?
The weather is beautiful
I am longing to be well
  but must have patience.
Sam thinks I will in
time. I think there
 will be no jasmine at
 all - the weather has
been so splendid
Everything seems to have
 benefited from the severe
early Spring (all that were
buried from the frost) - but
the frost did a lot of damage
to shrubs, over ground.
[unclear]Lara[/unclear] stays on and I must
keep the nurse for nights or
She so not do so but I am
gradually sliding into my old
ways and hope soon to be
able to dispense with her.
I am sending the usual cheque
dont  hesitate to keep it - I am quite
 able to pay my way - I am most
thankful to say. Lara keeps the
cash and all expenses [unclear][/unclear] -
I got more money back for
Income  [unclear]abatements[/unclear] than I expected
and asked for "small Income relief"
and got £57.0.8 back-
£83 had been deducted for income
tax.  So - the balance, really
deducted from my income was
£25.19.4 - which was quite a boom
Of course there will be the Dr & Nurse
[unclear]such[/unclear] I have quite enough laid by
at [unclear]Gh Roh[/unclear] St. to pay all.
I am greatly obliged for the

[unclear]coat[/unclear] it will be great use -
so light and warm and roomy
I am afraid you will miss it!
I am glad your kitchen garden
is flourishing. and hope your
funds will hold out?
I remember that big mill that
was burnt - on the left as you
drove to Colne - What a loss!
[unclear]Lara[/unclear] got back comfortably
and safely arriving at 8 a.m.
[insertion]Wed[/insertion] [unclear]neyh[/unclear] morning and having
to go off to see a patient;
She looked so well and seemed
so - and all enjoyed her
pleasant company, and she
very much enjoyed seeing her
relatives. and being at Orange
Hill. I wish her father could
have [unclear]Ru[/unclear] she would make
 such a recovery. I did rejoice
 to see her. It was 4 years
since she came over the
 first time. She is far better
now than she was then. but that
was just after she was set free.
I have not got Argents new address
 Please send it - Now farewell,
Much love
Mother
