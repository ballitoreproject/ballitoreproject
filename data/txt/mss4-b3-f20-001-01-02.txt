Dear friend

	+++ I have been much from home since my return from England: A visit was appointed by our National meeting ^to^ the Quarterly, monthly & particular meetings throughout our land, & also to the several Select meetings, & the families of those who compose them. The proposal originated (I believe) in the motion of life, through our mutual friend Samuel Smith. A number of friends, male & female, were separated for the service, & some of them entered upon it about two months ago  the church sent some of the elders, & the head of the church sent some ministers to join them. Our friend John Gough had been seized in the night in his sleep with a paralytick affection [sic], which for a while disabled him  but as (through divine favour) he grew better in a few days, he grew better in a few days, he exerted the degree of strength, to which he was mercifully restored, in proceeding on this visit  he travelled from the North to the South of this nation in company with James Christy, a respectable elder, about 81 years of ageIn the South they were joined by other friends of each sex, & the service was performed to the province of Munster, I believe to a good degree of satisfaction. I thought the Great Master owned the work [?], & afforded of his help for the performance of it. Indeed I believe an appointment of the church under right direction, carries peculiar weight & authority along with it, & in the mystery conveys additional strength to the servants [page number] 293 engaged in the 
labour. Our John Gough was much favoured, freshly & fully furnished, & enabled every way to get through the service. It is now suspended, but I hope ^will^ in due season be renewed. Joseph Williams of Dublin also entered the lists, & was very serviceable in ministry & discipline. His bodily presence is weak & mean, but his stature in religious growth is like to a Palm tree  he has taken ^& is taking deep^ root in the fertile soil of humility, & he shoots upwards proportionably in useful service. If thou wast to step over here to our next half-years meeting, I believe thou wouldst be pleased with the acquaintance of some choice spirits in this land, & notwithstanding thy sister (our sister) Deborah Darbys report, wouldst perhaps confess that the one half was not told thee. +++
	Cousin Deborah may perhaps recollect an old domestick in my family, whose name was Nannyshe exchanged (I believe) earth for heaven lately  I returned home just in time to be present at her interment here - 6th instant  John was on his return howards, & Anna was here on a visit to an intimate female friend of hers [sic]. She has been acknowledged, in due form, as well as felt in the life & power, to be a minister of the Gospel. She has wonderfully recruited as to health & strength, so as to travel about, & ride single on horseback, yet ^is^ still very delicate in constitution. Mary Moore of Waterford & Mary Watson are abroad with certificates, visiting the meetings and families of friends in divers [sic] parts of the Province of Leicester +++ Our families unite in the salutation of love to your families there  tho I do not particularize I forget none of you. Tell Priscy Gurney I often think, with pleasing recollection, on the agreeable walks & talks which she pleasured with [sic], when I was last at the Dale. I am, with renewed attachment, thy affectionate friend	Richard Shackleton
