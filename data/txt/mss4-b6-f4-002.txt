Newyork 5 month 28th 1817
My dear Friend
Thy very acceptable letter by Wm. Grattan
reached me some weeks since, & an opportunity offering to
Dublin, I avail myself of it to write thee a few lines -
Thou wilt be pleased to hear that W.G. got into a situation
in a Printing office, almost as soon as landed, where I hope
he will do well - had he wanted any assistance from me,
I would have truly given it - He had a long passage of
56 days, but the company being a very agreeable one, it did
not seem so long - vessels which have arrived since have
made the shortest passages (for a continuance) ever remembered -
one, was only 21 days from Liverpool, another 18 from
Greenock, another 23 from Dublin &c &c - What a short run
across the Atlantic! Truly, the imagination makes the
distance appear so formidable. By & bye, when they have
Steam boats going across, we may expect to leave this
on 1st day, sleep in Dublin that day week!
Newyork is too great a commercial City to be remarkable
for its literary Institutions - however one or two Buildings
are devoted to the Arts & Sciences - It would shrink in comparison
with one of your Cities, but when it is considered, what a
short time it has been built, & the people who first lived
in it, the progress it has made in the path of Science,
cannot by any means be called despicable - America
cannot as yet boast of many authors, but this may be accounted

for by the immense number of foreign books, which
annually arrive & are re-printed here - Every book of note
published with you, soon appears in an American edition.
The day may come, when it would be a question, whether
the exclusion of all foreign literature would not encourage
Native Genius - but at present there are so very
few (comparatively speaking) who cultivate the Finer Arts
that such an act would be impolite, & subject the Nation
to a literary Famine - The Americans can never gain any
great credit for home productions; how can they improve
on a Milton, a Pope, a Scott, a Byron & a thousand others?
No! they must endeavour to imitate what they cannot
excel. -
The Poor people in Ireland must have suffered
a vast deal of distress last winter for want of provisions &
yet, notwithstanding the great scarcity of Corn, ministers
would not stop distillation - but 'tis all of apiece with
their other conduct - "A bad tree cannot bring forth good fruit"
What a grand thing it is for America, that she is so
far removed from Europe! - She is not obliged to take part
in any of the quarrels of other Nations, but (as Solomon
himself would advise) gathers wisdom from their folly.
This Country is rapidly increasing in wealth & population
New towns spring up almost every week, in different parts
of the interior, & one state is almost annually added to
the Union - If the present policy or rather impolicy is
pursued much longer in England, it is to be feared that
many of her best subjects will quit the "Land of their

Forefathers" for " the more peaceful shores of America
& who would remain in a country where he is every moment
liable to an arrest, without offence, or if he sides
with Government, to be assasinated for his loyalty, while
America hold out such encouragement - Here are no tythes,
little taxes, no oppression, the poorest man (not only in
[underline]theory[/underline] but [underline]practice[/underline]) cannot be persecuted with impunity
But I do trust that better days are in
store for my country, she cannot always suffer - & if
the time arrives when every man will have his right, when
the voice of oppression shall cease, & the King be what he
ought to be, the "Father of his People" - then not
a subject would leave his home, tho' the most
enticing pictures of other countries were shown him.
The Yearly Meeting has just commenced here
It appears to be a very large one - some of the Country friends
cut a curious figure in a gay City like Newyork, but
they do not pay much attention to the opinion of the World -
[unclear]Jessy Kersey[/unclear], Henry Hull & Mary Sweat are here, all whom
thou may remember in Ireland - The former is reckoned
one of the best preachers in America, & is very generally
admired - Whenever he visits Philadelphia (he lives near
the city) he has more crowded audiences than any other
preacher - His language is very fine - rather flowery, his
delivery excellent - I think he looks very young -
Friends are increasing rapidly in this country, particularly
towards the Westward - The Yearly Meeting of Ohio, which is not
long established is now the largest in the Union - Philada.
yields to it in point of numbers - It will by & by be quite
a Quaker State -
We have some friends from Ohio at the Meeting, one of them
I understand is a great preacher however as yet he has given us
no samples of his oratorical abilities - There are also some from Canada
who seem real originals - Their is a very honest, but rather over
religious, Man, who tho' not in membership, regularly attends Meeting
here, & often drops a word of exhortation - Some time since he
felt himself [underline]concerned[/underline] to speak against cruelty to animals - he
could not approve of putting fishes while alive into hot water, or keeping
calves four days before killing them, without any thing to eat - After
reprobating the custom in very severe terms he concluded with this
[underline]original[/underline] thought - "And Oh! my friends if these poor animals have
the [underline]tongue[/underline] of [underline]Balaam's Ass[/underline] in the Day of Judgement, what tales
of misery will they unfold!" It is a saying here as well as in
Dublin that the Y. Meeting brings rain - & it is curious how it should
be so true a one - Until the first day of the Meeting we had very dry
Weather, but scarcely had the friends seated themselves when the rain began
to descend & gladden the heart of the farmer - from the present appearances
of this day I believe we shall have more -
I am nearly come to
the end of this page, & I believe for want of time I must here
stop; with love therefore, to all acquaintances in Ballitore as if
named (for which tell them I have not room) I remain thine sincerely Jacob Harvey
I have recd E Shackletons letter - & wrote her about a month ago
