My dear Mother,
It was unexpected to us to see Brother here,
I suppose a draft of kindness to a friend of his, who
wanted to come to this country induced him to take this
journey, he has been so pressing for one of my daughters
to return with him that we have consented to his taking
Sally, who thereby will have an opportunity of seeing thee
I expect, which I should like much to have myself if family
engagements did not so engross me, we heard Sally
Shackleton was with S: Talbot in Dublin waiting to cross
the water, & I hope thou wilt be helped & supported in
her absence, with everlasting sure help, which thou hast
often had gratefully to acknowledge being near, even riches
in poverty, strength in weakness, & a present help in
time of trouble, & surely many are our exercises & troubles
in this wilderness journey, but the prospect of a better is
cheering to the weary traveller, which I trust is thine
at times, tho' at other times clouds may obscure the view
yet let us remember, whatever changes may be our lot

for [insertion]worthy[/insertion] to be leaned upon & trusted in. We are this mercy
in health, have not moved to the Mill at Blogheen yet

at times visit[deletion]s[/deletion] it, & Richard keeps there, we long to be all
together, but must wait for an open to bring it about.
And now my dear Mother Farewell, my Husband joins in
dear love to thee; my dear love to W: & M: Leadbeater, &
to dear little Elizabeth & Jane. Tho' I dont often
