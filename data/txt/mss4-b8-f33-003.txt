Carlow 8 mo 17th 1805
Dear William
I Rec'd thy letter dated 26th & have since made enquiry
for two [unclear][/unclear] - one very good-one Bill : Mullen now in my
employ - I have concluded to let thee have [insertion]him[/insertion] for a few days
he has been just here a little [unclear]primed[/unclear] wch. seems to be
the sin wch. most easily besets him - he promises to get
another to go with him - expect he may be punctual
desire one of thy chaise men to call for them - wch
conveyance I proposed as encouragement & 2/2 a day meal
drink & lodging -
Two [deletion][/deletion] [insertion]messengers[/insertion] are now come from Ballitore &
no sign of my wife's whisky - is not one of your queries
"are friends punctual in fullfilling their engagements"
Tell Molly I have read a little of her favourite Cowper
the first poem [insertion]had[/insertion] the scene of the poets infamy - has filled mine eyes
if he goes on wth the same paths - I doubt not, my rough stony heart
will often become an heart of flesh
to his mother
Where once we dwelt our name is heard no more
Children not thine have trod my nursery floor
And when the gardner Robin, day by day
Drew me to school along the public way
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
A thousand other themes less deeply traced
Thy nightly visits to my chamber made

That thou might'st know me safe and warmly laid-
who can read these simple, genuine, & sublime effusions of a childs
sensibility & of a mothers care without feeling the force of
them - I love the poets, I love Molly, tell her so - but let
not these passionate feelings divert our attention [insertion]too much[/insertion] from the
fulfillment of other absolute duties
the bearer waits I must Conclude
thine &c LH
