Clonmel 1st month 6th 1783

My dear Uncle

Though I did not receive thy very acceptable letter as soon as I might if it had not been sent a tour round the Country by way of Youghal to Cork, yet since it reached me I have had time enough to reply to it, ^&^ had conversing with thee this way been as easy as I found pouring out my mind in secret to be, I should not have defered [sic] one post, but as in infinite wisdom (no doubt) our minds are at times drawn into solitude to resemble the Pelican in the Wilderness having no access to the habitable parts of the earth nor subject to human observation, so it appears consistent with godly jealosy [sic] that human consolation should be forbidden and that only having our dependance ^upon^ a gracious & merciful Father who deals with us as Children that require his chastizing hand, his rod & his staff we may procure to ourselves a safe foundation with a quiet habitation thereon out of the reach of human interruptions
	I feel no inclination to treat my beloved friend with the language of complaint, with secondary causes, persons & things nor do I wish to dwell on them myself but I feel a liberty to tell thee that my mind has of late been dipt into the depths of proving & distress & indeed what can I say of myself now but that my dwelling is amongst the pots [?]  may every dispensation do its office, is often the breathing of my spirit & though in the opening of the flood gates & the tossing of the tempest we may be ready in the anguish of our souls to cry carest thou not that I perish yet when theres a ray of hope that the master is not dead but sleepeth how reviving is that hope? & how it strengthens us to anchor on it?  surely there are none so tried as the poor weak instruments that are used for the divine will to be communicated through  these require not only the forming of the Potters hand but higher degrees of drying & greater heat in ^the^ furnace to glaze them than almost any other vessel, nay if I may be allowed to make the comparison they are like such pots or pye dishes that have to pass through the fire ^oven^ for every serving & after they are emptied & the company has enjoyed ^them^ they need more washing & scraping than ^any^ other utensil at the table & twenty to one if by the indiscretion of some sort or other they do not get cracked or broke  I look with dread, I am bowed down 
under ^it^ & dismayed at the sight of the precariousness of the standing of such, but especially my own  the consideration of human weakness & how frail I am is almost my meat & my drink  I seem just on the brink of giving up the cause & saying I will speak no more in thy name  under this dispensation I daily beg for ability to cast my anchor in deep water & rather to wash & anoint than appear to others to fast  Excuse this genuine language of my heart, I would treat thee with something more agreeable if I had it, but friendship loves truth & if it is pure ^it is^ not only its foundation but the whole structure is truth  it is comfortable through all to feel my mind attached to thee & thine. I hope on this basis; thy fatherly care & concern for me has been more acceptable & supporting to my mind than I shall attempt to express in [seal torn away] especially when I consider how I have left my native Land [seal torn away] sheilded [sic] by divine, immediate commission & unattended with a Companion in my own intricate path, tho blessed with one who take [sic] him through life will I hope prove better  When we are not sent its dangerous to run, even on the plausible errand of visitting [sic] our Kinsmen after the flesh & if we are suffered to go without disapprobation we need (however such a Child as myself) the attentive eye of the fathers in the Church  may I never forfeit a share of the unity of these notwithstanding the fellowship may be in suffering
	I dont know what to tell thee about Cork  Peggys history its likely thou has had, mine is engraven as with a pen of iron on the table of my heart & I am unable to transcribe it  I went with sadness, attended the meetings & returned with bitterness  had I some good thing to say of myself its very probable I should modestly impart it to thee & why then may I not tell thee that my foot sliped [sic]?  how excellent is the priviledge of having a monitor at home, an impartial friend in our bosom who if we enough attend ^to^ him is able to make us as wise as even our Teachers the reproofs & the wounds of this Friend is better than the kisses of an enemy  Friends here are brum full of appointments, they have the school to visit, families at Youghal to visit, & families at Clonmel  I hear much of my being concerned in them, they press me ^to^ consider these services; but if they knew my sackcloth covering & that in my house is neither food nor raiment they would quietly pass me by  I can see nothing of joining in these things & without woe is to me if I do them not I had rather be sitting by our fire side at Foston & knitting my Husband stockings if in ever such poverty of spirit  I long for more of that spirit which can rejoice in God alone though none else regard it [seal torn away] own its life  We look now at leaving this Land two or three weeks longer here is as long as we have in view & then perhaps to take shipping in Dublin instead of the North which we once thought of but have now pretty much dropt  Sister Peggy writes thee by this post which makes it unnecessary for me to say much about her family  We have parted, but we have not quarrelled  we love one another affectionately, but we are very secret in shewing it  poor thing she has many perplexities, thing though small in themselves which require a steady attention to or waiting ^for^ (as thou beautifully expressed it) baptizing virtue in order to gain a religious ascendancy over them We have had another letter from Father expressive of the welfare of our family  if I knew of thy writing soon to mother I would send a letter under thy wing for our covers to anybody in Yorkshire are done [?]  we have spent a week at Brother Joes [?] My Husband desires to be affectionately remembered to thee & thine 
I cannot send all the love I feel to Aunt Shackleton, Molly, Sally, Aby, Lydia & thy self nor express the grateful sensibility that often covers my mind for the hospitable & affectionate entertainment I met with under thy roof as we seen bone of the same bone & flesh of the same 
flesh may every joint be supplied with fresh instructions & divine strength is the present fervent desire of thy very affectionate S Grubb
