30th.. Wednesday - Lyd rode over to Ballyman
and dined there - Philip accompanied
her back and staid until tea time.
31 Thursday. - [unclear]Lyd[/unclear] and I went down
to Bray and by chance met Margt
who was on her way to Ballyman.
So having accomplished our business
we drove there and staid to dinner.
This is the last day of this
year - Oh I hope there may be
some improvement when next
I write on the last day of the year.
Though apparently surrounded with
blessings, I am so thankless as to
wish for things I have not.
One in particular which perhaps
might not be good for one [unclear]If[/unclear] if
it is not granted I hope I may
be quite content. A contented
mind would be a great improvement.
