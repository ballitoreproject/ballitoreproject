He has been a long time ill and
has travelled about a good deal for
his health but with little or no
benefit and as a last resource
came here. And is now much
better. There is another gentleman
whose name I do not know and
whose appearance I do not like
also a great [unclear]farmerish[/unclear] looking
man who seems to have travelled
a good deal and talks often of

their rooms I will not mention
as it would be [insertion]entirely[/insertion] too much trouble.
The Rev Mr Stuart a light sandy
haired little man very chatty and rather
