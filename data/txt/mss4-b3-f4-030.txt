Clonmel 8th month 29th 1789.

My dear Uncle

	Thy letter of the 22d instant met me at Cork just on coming out of a meeting, when it was ^indeed^ more than a cup of cold water, opening the sluices which for several days had been locked up, because the Beloved of souls was unusually to my mind ^in that city^ a Fountain sealed  If ever a word of encouragement came in the needful time to a feeble traveller, ready to faint for thirst, thine did at the breaking up of the womens meeting, after two days secret, painful exercise  I concluded from what I felt, there might be no harm in staying the meeting on 3d day & my husband consenting we did; & though as is often my lot (I suppose for want of skill in dividing the word) speaking to men did not releive [sic] my inward oppression, yet in prostration before the almighty Helper (who in abundant mercy is touched with a feeling of our infirmities,) there was a secret, sustaining evidence of living ^again^ in His presence, whereby the bones that were broken did rejoice  Thus are the poor of the flock helped in their extremities & encouraged to maintain their confidence in the omnipotent, gathering arm of Israels Shepherd 
Our poor, dear S. Lees (who once expressed a few words in a publick meeting in Cork) had an inclination to have stayed a few days, but says she was ashamed to mention it  The uneasiness of her mind has so encreased since her return that she tells us if we have no objection, she is most easy to go back & be at Garryroan meeting tomorrow on her way: with which we concur; hoping her devotedness (at last) & example &c may not be without their use at the assemblage of young people next 3d day on account of Susy Hattons marriage
I was thinking before this step occurred that probably some of our young women would have met you at Moat; but now it looks more doubtful, for our large family wants much attention, & the childrens improvement (as far as we can promote ^it)^ is an object hardly to be dispensed with 
	Perhaps thou hast hear of a Mary Lloyd, Sampsons daughter  My mother corresponds with her & in freedom proposed to her coming over to us & lending a little assistance ^in the school^ This uniting Marys secret inclination soon drew from her a candid acknowledgement, 

which mother transmitted to us  Whereupon I wrote to her father & have received a very friendly & polite compliance with the invitation to serve us as well as herself, which we accept as disinterested & truly great; [word crossed out] ^for from^ their line of life & connexions in the world a great many objections might have occurred  It is proposed for her to come over with M. Routh in the 10th month but nothing yet fixed  The removal of a young woman from that land to this serves at times (if nothing does) to keep my mind low  It is a very great trial of faith for to do it lightly I canno, I dare not & if best help & wisdom forsake us herein we faint  This one circumstance about Mary is rather easier to us than some heretofore because the concern seems our mothers & her own so that we have little to do but let her come
O that we may, & that I may indeed take deeper & deeper root in humility, it is a bulwark my soul at times is favoured to enter into; but Satan roars most of all about this habitation, & when the mind is not sure enough to delight in it, & to rejoice in the tribulation, alas he gains its attention to some ^the^ lo heres or lo theres & instils [sic] in some transformation or other his Luciferian spirit
True my dear Uncle this is a place of great contest between flesh & spirit but if the Lord delight in us he is able to give us the land
^4th day^ 9th month 2d I have kept this bye me expecting an opportunity of sending ^it^ to Moat to meet thee at the province meeting, as thine did me but not with an expectation that it can be equally acceptable yet with a beleif [sic] that thou wilt not reject it
Now it appears that a valueable [sic] cargo is to be sent ^from hence^ under the convoy of his popish servants to visit you & be visitted [sic] by you at Moat  Alas for those called the household of faith, & such as are seeking to be heirs of two kingdoms! I want abundance more patience than I have, to bear with them in the present case.
Almighty Protection is better than them all put together & I wish it may ^be^ more & more truly said to the women of Clonmel great is your faith therein for they are likely to be in a poor way without it  I doubt not but thou & thine will enjoy (tho in suffering) the company of the three sisters now joining in this little expedition & their journey will be profitable to themselves & others  Sister ^E.T.^ has lately had a letter from York by which we dont find that she is likely very soon to be taken from ^us^ but this & other things she can tell herself
Our dear S. Shackleton is still in Cork, we hope you will not be in haste for her return to Ballitore after she leaves ^it^ as we have quite too little of her company yet, & to curtail her visit there (were it in our power) is not desirable; dear S. Neales fatherly & instructive company ^& encouragement^ now on the decline of life being a great treasure for a young disciple to reflect upon 

[note margin p. 1]
I have with a letter received from S. Benson of Liverpool a particular account of dear Williams [?] latter end which I present to S. Smith who will shew it thee I doubt not  I am greatly obliged to thee my dear uncle for thy communications, favour me with them in future as way opens & at all times remember for good thy very affectionate S R Grubb
