To EL's Bower
Thou [deletion]withering[/deletion] lonely bower no longer gay
Since she who graced thee is away.
Ye flowers where beauties linger here
and smile upon the fading year
as if for her return [deletion]they[/deletion] [insertion]you[/insertion] staid
Expecting still her friendly aid
But ere your guardian fair draws nigh
Full low your beautious heads shall be
These happier hours need not repine
Increasing charms shall yet be thine
and spite of winter's surly brow
Thy painted seat thy twisted bough
Even now Elizabeth with [unclear]grees[/unclear]
with looks of approbation now
While Memory paints the festal hour
which honoured thee thou favour'd bower
Twas when the Seraph Peace restord
the Captive sheath'd the bloody sword
Cheer'd the sick heart & dry'd the tears -
The band assembled here
Thy portal gay the garland gracd
twas here by [unclear][/unclear] plac'd
tribute of feeling & of taste
Fair virgin hands the garland [deletion]framed[/deletion] [insertion]form'd[/insertion]
Their breasts with patriot order warm'd
The patriot[unclear][/unclear] their bosoms
Here bloom'd the Rose Britanias pride
[deletion]With[/deletion] [insertion]And[/insertion] Erin's Shamrock side by side
With Caledonias thistle ly'd
The Sprig from Austrias piny tree
For France the beauteous fleur de lis
While Russia lent the friendly band
Kind is the heart which rules his land
[deletion]why him [/deletion] charms
Alas this scene now dull & drear
Was then to taste & feeling clear
Yet think not that this [unclear]Merless[/unclear] laid
[deletion]To distant scenes[/deletion] [insertion]From care in season of [/insertion] pleasure rovd
With weeping hast her way [insertion]she fondly [/insertion]sped
To tend upon the dying bed
Where worn with pines pain reclin'd
Her friend her uncle over kind

That silence, those imploring eyes
That emblem displayd
Of him who in deaths agonies
For his assassins prayd
Oh they have conquer'd & this heart
Its stony nature gone
Accursed be that bloody hand
which dealt the deadly blow
 Fierce rushing from his secret stand
and laid my brother low
Soon ceased the gallant youth to feel
But in my tortured being
Deep rankles still the [deletion]cruel[/deletion] [insertion]murderous[/insertion] Act
And robs my soul of rest
Revenge with all her dreadful [unclear]train[/unclear]
[deletion]Now[/deletion] Has marked me for a prey
[unclear][/unclear] on my hear distracts my brain.
And sweeps my peace away
To the Postmaster
No more my pitying heart oerflows
With love to human kind
[unclear][/unclear]
Lost is that [unclear][/unclear] which heaven bestows
To [deletion]bless th[/deletion] that joy from death refin'd
Edward S. Lees.
To see his pangs his gushing blood
Sweet to Revenge would be
Ha [deletion]softly[/deletion] where that form glides thro the wood
The assassin, yes - tis he.
And he is here & at my feet
Why suffer him to live
Why said I that revenge is sweet
Tis sweeter to forgive
