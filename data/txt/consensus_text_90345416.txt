Eliza and Jane also Uncle Francis,
26 Saturday. Who should call but
Charlie on his way to town, having
driven the new carriage out as far as
Temple Hill. Floy and I escorted
him down to the train; and afterwards
walked to Kingstown.
As I was so near I paid a very pleasant
visit to Anne Webb. Sissy was
preparing for school - as they had
settled to send her to Darlington.
27 Sunday - Came home with Papa
and Mama after meeting
28 Monday. Lovely day. Simmons
Walpole dined here - he has plenty
of chat and rather original.
29 Tuesday. N P.
30 Wednesday. Florence and Jane
came this morning to spend the
day - and had a drive up in
the new carriage.
We had great fun this evening
with Philip, singing and dancing
and laughing.
