My dear Niece
I hope you are
not angry with me for
having to long delayed in
answering your two kind
notes, let me assure you
that it was not want of
inclination prevented me from
doing so, but want of time
arising principally from business,
but partly from something else,

what that something is,
I leave you to guess.
I received the purse quite
safe, and hope it will last
me for a long time, it is
a most capacious one, and
if always full will render
the owner completely independant
of the ills of poverty.
You were the first to
inform me that I was a
grand uncle, I feel quite an
old man ever since, and
in consequence do my best
not to think of my claim to
the venerable title; which
is my being a grand uncle
or little Lyddy being an Aunt
the most curious circumstance?
the former - most decidedly.
When you see her do not
forget to remember me to
Aunt Polly.
I am sorry to hear that
Uncle Thomas is not better,
please give my love to him,
Aunt Eliza, and Grandmamma,
and like a good girl write
a few lines on receipt of
this letting me know how

Uncle Thomas is, also
the children at Dunlavin,
and at same time tell
me all the news you have,
and what my grand nephew's
name is to be.
Not knowing where you
are to be found at present,
I enclose this letter in one
to Aunt Martha requesting
her to have it forwarded
to you by post.
It is now just 1 o'clock at night
and time to bring this letter to
a close by subscribing myself
Your affectionate Uncle
Arthur
