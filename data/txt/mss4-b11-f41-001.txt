Dear Mrs Davis
I received your note &
looked into Mrs Farrell's
qualifications - but she
did not appear to be
suited for the special
work here.
It is a most difficult
place to fill - & the only
one which gives one

trouble.
With kind remembrances
I am
Yours very truly
[underline]T. W Russell.[/underline]
