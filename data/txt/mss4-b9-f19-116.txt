My dear Eliz Willie will not suck, [insertion][deletion]at[/deletion][/insertion] all we can do
I am sorry that poor Biddy will be disappointed
I write to S Doyle to know if she could get her a
nursing but fear she cannot at present - I am
much obliged for the apples, I had heard that Lucy
Jacob was not so well & was glad to hear
thro' thee that she was better I was uneasy
about her when I heard there was [unclear][/unclear]
to her recovery I mean to send this & the basket
by George I will keep the last basket for the next
op: - if we had not tired Willie with a
nurse we should blame ourselves if he did
not get well so that I can hardly regret getting
Biddy only on her own account, M Chambers
suffers much pain occasionally with her leg
[unclear][/unclear]as then just [unclear]sorer & said[/unclear] her, also Betsy who
was busy writing both keep up their spirits
very well, - I sent by Kenna to Mary White
1 doz of paper to match her pattern please
to ask her if it came to kind Lydia's [insertion]little[/insertion] bonnet
is nicely done up but I have no way of sending it
yet - I believe Sarah Knott is in town
many thanks for the reading of TW's letter I enclose it,
Biddy is afraid the woman will be troublesome
about giving up her child I am very sorry for
her disappointment but will do all in my power
to get her a nursing I should have tried
some woman before I can't [unclear][/unclear].

I send an old knife
which came in one
of the baskets I send one
basket & have two for
the next op:
