Dublin 1mo: 23d. 1786
Dear Molly
Ann: Fayle applied to me for a Ball of worsted
the same sort thou had Past - that I send is the same in
Quality, & if not quite the same couler, very near it ~
As I apprehend thou & thy Parents, would like to hear how it
fares with our Dr. friend Jam.s Christy of Lurgan, thought
it might be Acceptable to send the Acct. I this morning recd.
in a letter from his Bro.r John. which take in his own words
as follows - viz " The day I wrote thee an Acct. of his Illness he
"was indeed rather Alarming affected & we had determined
"on sending to Belfast for Doctor Halliday next morning, if
"no favourable symptoms should intervene to render it
"Unnecessary - Agreeable to our hopes He that Night rested
"better than any time before, & found himself refreshed considerably
"by the sleep which He got. The Physician gave a very
[unclear][/unclear] flattering Opinion of the Alteration, & satisfied us that there
[unclear][/unclear]as no Necessity for Additional assistance. ~
" Since that time He has continued as we think rat[unclear][/unclear]
His throat seems to heal in a slow but certain degree [unclear][/unclear]
"any appearance of mortification, & altho' He still labours [unclear][/unclear]
"a considerable depression of spirits, & seems as yet to have
"gained little or no strength, we are in hopes that the dangerous
"part of the disorder is over, & yt. time & care thro' the
"assistance of Providence will restore him to health, & his
"anxious friends, by whom, & by the Society at large in this
"Quarter his loss would be much felt
The day I wrote thee above mentioned was 16th. Inst.
my Dr Love to Parents, Bror. Alm. & family. & am thy Lo: friend
