Lisburn January 4th 1812
Allow me my dear Friend, to begin my
reply to your kind & acceptable letter by wishing
you many very many returns of the new year & may
each succeeding year find you & the rest of my Ballitore
friends possessed of encreasing happiness
I am indeed thankful for your kindness in writing
to me & I hope you will continue to write when
you have leisure & inclination. I am sorry I can
make only a poor return for your letters but I
do not wish to say much on this subject as you
might think I affected humility when I really
expressed my candid opinion of my letters & of
all things in the world I detest an appearance
of affectation
Your papers all arrived safe, & I suppose
before this time you have seen them in the
Magazine Pray who wrote "Week no more"? It
& The Voyage of Life were much admired. The
proprietors of the magazine have no objection to
tales if they are well written, but they have found
it necessary to reject a great deal of nonsense
written under the title of tales. The [insertion]proprietors[/insertion] have been
induced to come to the solution to exclude reviews

of new publications, except in a few instances, as
The different writers are almost as well known
in this country, as if their names were printed
at the conclusion of the reviews, & so much offence
has been taken because a regard for truth
& candor would not permit them to bestow
unmixed praise in their critiques. And what
book can be held up as perfectly faultless.
Have you had Joseph Lancaster in Ballitore
Betsy & I went to Belfast to attend his lecture &
I met him in a very large company at Dr [unclear]Drennan[/unclear]
I was prepared to think highly of him, as I
think he has done so much good in the world
by diffusing [insertion]& cheapening[/insertion] education, but I am sorry to say
that an acquaintance with him has made
me think very little of him. At dinner he
behaved very oddly & instead of joining in the
general conversation he kept whispering to the
gentleman who sat next him. And after dinner
instead of objecting in a gentleman like manner
to join in drinking toasts, [deletion]he[/deletion] he told us in a vulgar
manner that indeed he never drank [underline]toast except[/underline]
[underline]in small beer[/underline]. Mrs Drennan was extremely
provoked at him. He began in several places to
speak harshly of my father, but unfortunately

for the poor man, he always happened to meet
with some of my father's intimate friends, who
checked his illiberality. I liked part of his lecture
but he was very tedious & the theatre was
dismal cold & some of his audience were completely
tired. He dwelt too long on his interview
with the King & the royal family, & he illustrated
his subject by low jests - he says when
girls talk too much he gives them a cup of
[unclear]camomile[/unclear]tea, as their tongues are the
ninth of an inch too long & they [unclear]always[/unclear]
use nineteen words when thirteen would do
equally well. Perhaps a cup of camomile tea
might be prescribed for me if I write too much,
as writing too much is nearly as bad as talking
too much, & you may think I am too much inclined
to censure a man, who, with all his failings
is likely to do a great deal of good.
Have you read Scott's new vision? I am told
that he composed it in two nights. Will you consider
this as a proof of his genius, or a proof of
the folly of the people in being imposed on so
easily as to admire his hastily written nonsense?
I shall send the money to Dublin as you direct
by the first opportunity; but I think I may have
an opportunity of selling the gloves next summer, &

if Betsy thinks she cannot dispose of them sooner
I think they may as well remain here - I hope
to persuade Ward & McIntyre to pay for 18 of the
Anecdotes soon, but whenever I speak to them
on the subject they say they can only pay me
for the books they have sold & return the remainder;
as I do not like to take any back from them,
I have been obliged to delay settling their account
much longer that I would wish to do - Does Betsy
get all her straw plat sold? & how do the manufactures
of lace & goose down succeed - & in short
tell me every thing about your school - our school
continues to flourish, last week we distributed our
premiums for good conduct, & I think you would have
