My dear James,
        After tossing & hurrying about I am at length settled in my old hole, have put on my every-day-clothes & sat down to converse with an old friend ++ [page number] 219 
The yearly meeting being the great Representative of our religious society is always the scene of deep travail to my wading spirit, & though I am seldom much heard there, my spirit intercedes for a blessing upon, & success to the labours of others. I had some part in writing-business, & had renewed cause for the exercise of patience. For the surgeon's knife to cut away an excrescence, or some part that has no life or feeling, is well, & not only tolerable but desirable - but it gives pain to cut the sound flesh +++ It is hard to weld together the religious sentiments of different persons, so as to make one ^faith^ simple, united mass. I have observed that if we mix together two kinds of liquor, though each of them separately be very clear, yet the mixture has a muddy appearance. +++ Remember me us affectionately to  &  My heart hones [?] after those young people, that they may follow on to know the Lord in the progress of his manifestations to them; & being faithful & obedient to every clear discovery of duty, whether great or small, whether publick or private, may grow strong in the Lord, and in the power of His might. By faithfulness in matters comparatively small, accumulated strength & encouragement ensues accrues - Clean hearts and clean hands give boldness & confidence - "Thy servant slew both the lion & the bear & this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he hath defied the armies of the living God.
