Your uniform sweet attention
to me my dear Mrs. Leadbeater, is highly
gratifying to me — You could scarcely have
sent me anything I should prefer to the
[unclear][/unclear] of T. Wilkinson & Mr. Burke - I will
peruse them the first leisure moment,
& carefully return them - at present we
are completely fretted by the ingratitude
& knowing of two Men in whom we once
placed great confidence — viz, our own Servt.
& Sergt. [unclear]Gorsin[/unclear], both of whom have Deserted.
I do indeed highly Esteem T. Wilkinson,
& most cordially agree with him on the subject
of War - your Brother lent me that Poem.
So many vexations, & indeed losses, are
come upon us, that I begin to dread [unclear]wheth.[/unclear]

it will be possible to see Patterdale
this Summer — I expect to know more
shortly — I am always truly happy to see
you; & would call on you, but only you are
much engaged & seldom alone — I fear
I shall be one of the stiff-necked Generation
for the remainder of my life — but the
pain in my Side & head are less violent.
I am proud of thinking you really are
what you profess to be - my "affectionate
Friend", believe me not less Sincerely &
affectionately Yrs.
[unclear]JG[/unclear]
If you are not allow'd the overcharge of
the [unclear][/unclear], of course we are your debtors
for them —
