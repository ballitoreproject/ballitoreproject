Cork 2nd of 10th month 1792 -
My dear friend,
Thou has really gratified me, if must use the term,
& perhaps some part of this letter will afford thee a degree of the same kind of gratification
- such a production as that from that capital man EB. could
scarcely fail of producing grateful sensations, even to a mind less interested than
some of ours ought to be - there was something in me, probably the weak part,
that I confess is as, as it were, delighted wih so lively & descriptive a testimony,
but allow me to say, that I feel myself rather more sensibly & solidly gratified by
some of thy own kind expressions, & while I may be, in mercy, favoured wth: any
degree of lost life, I believe it will be very desirable & very grateful to me, that
you should consider & own me, [deletion]on [/deletion]if not as part of the family, at least as an
old family friend, that had someplace, even with affections of him that is gone
I believe I shall not say a great deal on the subject at present, nor will I affect
to be overwhelmed with grief - I greatly dislike passionate, short lifed sorrow -
It was particularly kind of thee to let me have any of the last precious expressions,
& I can abide that you have been very careful in gathering every fragment of them;
it is them I want to have in my possession, but I wish not to be impatient. -
What I alluded to in gratifying thee was, that Edm Burke's son has been
some time in & about this City - I klow it before thy letter came, & do not, dear Molly,
be displeased me for saying, that I deliberated a good deal about going to see him,
I even had almost concluded not to go - I may safely say that I let in the reasoner -
thou

There is hardly one I believe much weaker in this respect, or more ill suited
to such society - I almost hate to be rubbing my shirts to great folks either in or out of -
our own society - I trust I was not wanting in respect to the memory of him who
can not [deletion][/deletion][insertion]in time[/insertion] be forgotten, but I conclused that I had no claim of my own to the
friendship or even acquaintance [insertion]wth[/insertion] [deletion]of[/deletion] the house of Burke - perhaps all my thoughts
about this matter even wrong & foolish, however, my conclusion did not stand long -
thy letter so set it completely aside. I thought I should not be well able to
answer to[underline]thee[/underline] for not going, & go I did to R Burke's lodging on seventh day last -
he reced the visit quite politely, as might be expected, & seemed to consider & remember
me as thy Father's friend, wch. thou may well suppose was the most pleasing
part he could act. he also spoke of him as we would all like he should -
He returned the visit yesterday, took a cup of chocolate [insertion]readily[/insertion], & engaged to breakfast
with us tomorrow morning - so that I mean to keep this open till then -
Having heard from thee, as I did, was a nice introduction for me, & whether right
or wring, I showed him the copy of his Father's letter, wch seemed to please him,
& not only so, but I read for him that part of thy letter, wch justly calls thy
Father his Father's "[underline]best[/underline] friend" if I went too far, thou must forgive me.
My attending another yearly meeting is indeed very uncertain, but if I was
going, & that thou really desired I might call to see EB, I could hardly refuse thee -
his son politely invited me, as he was pleased to say, not only on my own account,
but as Richard Shackleton's friend, or some such - We spoke of his going to Ballitore
& I requested he would not omit it - he seems fully to purpose paying you a visit
& I think said he declined it on his way hither, because our loss was then so recent -
he lodges very near us, at Patrick O'Conor's, a high Merchant -

We have had the Count.rs comp.y [unclear][/unclear] very courteously, & expect he will
spend a little more time wth us before [unclear]he leaves[/unclear] this City, wch I suppose will not be sooner
than next week, if then - he has commissioned me wth. his kind remembrance to you,
& says he expects to be at Ballitore in the course of a month - I wish his errand to this
Nation was of a more pleasant kind, but let us not distract or defile ourselves about
these things - we have trouble enough besides, at least some of us have a portion of it -
I am indebted to our dear Abram for his very kind letter finished in Dublin, & but for
this opportunity, would think it needful to write to him speedily, lest he should have any
expectation from me towards the testimony, in wch I am sufficiently interested to attempt
something, and truly I could testify, but let nothing be expected from me - experience
hat taught me, on a late occasion, (SN's) that I am not competent to such things -
I had a very kind Salutation from Mary Dudley last week, dated 18th & 20th ulto: mostly
written at [deletion][/deletion] Newport Pagnell - I wrote to her almost [unclear][/unclear] receiving the stroke
A small part of what she says [insertion]to wit[/insertion], "I know what it is to feel no small portion of sorrow,
"& whether profitably or not, I do from my very heart lament, that such a light hath
"for ever ceased to shine in this lower world, that it is set to us & to the Church in this
"dreary day; & that some of us are likely a while longer to traverse thy wilderness without
"such a Beacon to direct - We, who were honoured wth. an intimate knowledge of him,
"& largely partook of his fatherly care, may, I trust, allowably mourn - "Jesus wept"
"& I am aware, while I address thee, that thy tired mind will deeply experience a spring
" of sweet consolation dryed up, that, in a peculiar manner, Thou art [underline]bereaved[/underline], but &c.
"Let us gather up every fragment from his bright example, his unreserved dedication,
"his humility, his attachment to the noblest cause, his - more than I believe will ever be
"fully enumerated, excellence, & be afresh incited, in proportion to our measures, [unclear]haim[/unclear]
"to follow him as he assuredly followed Christ." She says much more on that subject, that
we shall ever [unclear]depend[/unclear] of, but time, & paper are nearly full - I hope to see thee soon, yet there
would be time enough to hear from thee, & I need not say how acceptable it would be -
I salute you all in near affection -
Farewell dearly. J. Abell
