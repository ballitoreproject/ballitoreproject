Dublin April 1744
Dr. Dicky,
Since I am deprived of your Company, that
was so agreeable to me, & the sweet hours that I spent in Ballitore
in your conversation, & condemn'd to noise, smoak & Dublin
town, all I can do is to alleviate the pains of absence by an epistolary
correspondence; but here I am stopped by the expiration
of Priviledge, which, though a bar to us, yet it may be rem[deletion]i[/deletion]edied
in some measure by the carman, &c. Without farther
Prologue, I shall acquaint you with my adventures since I
left you, [deletion]with[/deletion] [insertion]which[/insertion] tho' perhaps not so entertaining, nor so full of
surprising events as those of Don Quixot, [unclear]Jossy[/unclear], &c may serve to
let you know that Dick Chidley & I arrived pretty late at this
City, rather of the latest, for the watchman had there impudence
to inform the town how bad travellers we were by
 crying, past 12 O Clock- I was however let in; went to bed;
slept, & was sent in company with Jack Baily, immediately
after breakfast next morning (i e) monday morning to Dr.. Pellasior,
Fellow of Trinity College near Dublin, a gentleman (since
it falls in my way to give his conjectural character) accounted
one of the most learned in the University, an exceeding good humoured,
cleanly, civil fellow. N. B. I judge by outward appearances.
We were admitted into his room, & he has three very grand
ones; he & Jack Baily had a good deal of Chat, & a couple of
men were setting up a barometer in his room, so he could not
for a while examine me; at last he brought out Francis Horace,
Dauphine's Virgil, & Homer, with I dont know who's notes, he
made me construe scriberis Varis, &c, & [unclear]Eheul[/unclear] Postume, & in Virgil
I begun the 103rd.. line the 6th.. AE [unclear]n[/unclear] & in Homer with the
7227th. line of the 3rd.. Head. & the 406th.. of the sixth, & he was
pleased to say ( what I would not say after him, unless to a
par

particular friend) that I was a good scholar, understood the authors
very well, & seemed to take pleasure in them (yet by the
by I dont know how he could tell that). & that I was more fit
for the Colledge than three parts of my class, but he told me
I must be examined again by the Senr. Lecturer; he was sent
for, but was not at home, therefore Mr. Pallasier told me I
must have the trouble of calling again, he was going out, and
introduced me, according to custom I believe, to the Provost, who
is an old sickly looking man: to be short, this morning I was
examined very strictly with another young lad by Mr. Aubins,
or Robbins ( I dont know which) the Senr. lecturer, in the odes,
sermons & epistles of Horace, & am admitted.-. I cannot express,
nor have the knack of doing it, how much I am obliged to your
father for the extraordinary pains & care he has taken with me
so as to merit the commendation of my Tutor, & all I can do
is to behave myself so as not bring a scandal upon him or
his School. Ive nout more to say, but that yesterday I went
to J. Fletcher's to invite your Mother, she was not at home;
I left the letters for her. Pray remember my love to all my
schoolfellows, & to Mr. Burn in particular, tell Master Pearce for
his comfort, that I was examined in AS in Droes, & give service
to all the girls, & inform Nanny Morris that I have
thought of her once or twice, & that if she has a mind for a
Coach & six let her tell what colour'd horses she will have,
and it shall be sent her by the first opportunity; but in the
mean time give her a Box, & place it to account, & this shall
be sufficient warrant for so doing: tis almost night, & I must
write to the Master, so I must conclude without more ado, all as
one now
Ned Burke
I saw your friend Herbert at his shop door as I went to
the Colledge to day, & I stood a while to speak to him. I went to
see

see M. Brugh but he was gone out of town.
The microcosm will leave town the 28 so consider what to do
Send to me the next Carman that, goes & I'll send you some
thing; or send Harry Bawne.
