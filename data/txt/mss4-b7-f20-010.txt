January 1811.
Dear Mrs Leadbeater
I was very glad to hear so good an
account of the Widow and her two Daughters. Your Niece
seems to be most benevolently employed, and I sincerely wish
her success for the Poor of Ireland loudly call for attention
and every Person particularly those who are upon the Spot and
able in any way to assist towards the amelioration of their
condition are bound to do it - Heaven will doubtless bless your
Nieces endeavors, and make it happy for Ballitore that she
resides their. I pray that her activity may remain unabated.

You speak of bankruptcies in Dublin, but bankruptcies in London and
indeed all over the Kingdom prevail to a most disasterous
degree. That many with too much cause deplore the union I
can too easily alas believe, but I live in hopes that those who now
deplore shall hereafter rejoice. What you state of Noblemens and
Gentlemens paternal Seats abandoned is grievous to think of, but
that toil will I hope correct itself, and sick of dying with english
Expence and spending their money amongst Strangers, they will
return with patriotic Spirit and spend their Incomes in Ireland.
I enclose the half of a pound Note to be applied towards your
work for the poor Peasantry, and should you not carry your

design into execution I would wish your Niece to apply it towards
the purposes of her School. I send half the Note, and on receiving
information that it is safely come to hand I will forward the other
half - If you will give me intelligence where Subscribers send for
the Cottage Dialogues, I will send for mine -
With every good wish for Success in all your benevolent
undertakings as also those of your worthy Niece whose
Name and Age I should like to be acquainted with, I am
dear Mrs Leadbeater your Sincere Friend
