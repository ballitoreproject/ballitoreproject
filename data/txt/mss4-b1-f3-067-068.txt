				Lisburn, 18th of Fifthmonth, 1779.
		*** There is a number of young people up and down, hopeful and promising, who do not prefer the tinsel vanities of this world, to the substantial comforts of Divine favour. They are not compatible together: the idol which the uncircumcised nature worships, cannot stand where the ark of the testimony dwells. We must choose which we would serve; and on making a right choice, and persevering therein, depends our everlasting happiness. Oh! my children, be wise, and make the glad hearts of your tender, affectionate father and mother, whowatch over you, with a solicitous care, for your good. Be humble and meek, that you may be taught of the ways of the Lord, and your understanding guided in sound judgment. So will ye be as happy as the condition of mortal man can be; in yourselves feeling renewedly the evidence, assurance, and earnest of a blessed immortality, and you will come up successors in the maintenance of the noblest cause that ever was, or ever will be on earth. No honour equal to the that of being the servants of Christ; no wages of such high value as he liberally bestows. The time hastens with unremitting speed, which will decide on each of us. The past is irrevocable, the future uncertain; therefore, now is the accepted time, and NOW is the opportunity which should be laid hold on, and diligently improved by us all, and each of us.
