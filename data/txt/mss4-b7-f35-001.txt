Ballidarton 13th: 4: mo 1782
It has often occured to my mind since wee parted to address
my Dear Molly with a few lines and notwithstanding
all the difficulties that apeared to mee in writing to
so good a scribe, Thou sees I have ventureed to excuse
my Poor scrol and tho it may not bee worth Thy
perusal yet I thank my Dear Girl will accept it
as a token of my sincere regard for her, and look
over the many blunders perhaps with a partial eye.
since my return home I have not yet got up my
sperits my Dear and kind friends at Balitore
has been almost thee constant companion of
my mind, with desirs that I may not do any thing
to forfit the Friendship the have showed mee, more
abundantly than I deserve, and for whitch I feel my
self under many obligations particularly to thy
truly valuable Father and mother to whome plais
present my very Dear love , also to thy amiable
present my very Dear love , also to thy Amiable
Brother and Sister whome I love and admire for their

many good qualifications, Our friends hear seem generally
well accept my Nephew Sam who is still poorly, Inclosed I
send the seed whitch hope will be acceptable to thy
mother, Plais remember mee affectionately to thy sister
Sally & Hannah Taverner, also any friend that Thou thinks
proper that may enquire for mee, with mutch affection
I remain my Dear Molly thy sincere friend
