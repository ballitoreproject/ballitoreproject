I played a game of chess which
is not yet finished - Ned went
to see [deletion]th[/deletion] a Panorama which
I believe was not worth the trouble
Polly and I intend going to

30[underline]th[/underline], Fifth day - At about eleven
Uncle Richard called as he
had appointed the [insertion]Colmanstown[/insertion] committee
to meet there Papa &, Polly
to meet there Papa, Polly
came in soon time after &
as soon as we could she & I
went out together first to Aunt
Cole's to leave her some flowers
which Polly had brought in,
which Polly had brought in.
and then on a little round
of shopping and home to
dinner - seven O'clock saw
