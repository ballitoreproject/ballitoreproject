Dear Cousin
I was well pleas'd with thy
kind Letter, so was my Sister Sally with
thy Sisters to her, she can't write, but sends
her Love to Cousin Sally, my Aunt says
Ballitore is a delightful Place, I shou'd
be pleased to see it, if it was near, then I
shou'd see you all; but it is a long way off
my Sister Nancy designs to write to thee
when my Aunt write again my Fathers
Brother and Sisters join in Love to you
all from thy obliged Cousin
