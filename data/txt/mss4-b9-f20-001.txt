My dear Elizth
It is almost time for one to acknowledge
thy two notes which were very welcome as signs
that thou wert coming to thyself after I may say
thy very aweful illness, how heavily has our dear
father been tried within these few months! first
deprived of his greatest earthly comfort, his Angelic
Companion then threaten'd with the loss of those
who were still left to sustain & cherish him
& the actual loss of his kind good humour'd & active
assistant in poor Anty, but he always bore his
trials with most exemplery patience & meekness.
We are at length comfortably settled in the country
in a very small house consisting of a small
parlour 3 small bedchambers a nice little kitchen
pantry servants room & coal hole, I hope before
the summer is over thou wilt come & see
for thyself We have a tolerably large garden
in which Edw has sown some peas having
an age to the future, I was often thinking during
sewers about the house were remember'd

all the illness you have had whether the [deletion]shewers[/deletion]

I find[deletion]d[/deletion] I have made a mistake here, did any
of you hear from Limerick lately I am quite in the
dark about them there not having heard any thing of them
since Sally went home, how is Mrs Linton? I was
sorry to miss seeing S Dawson on her return We were
at Glendruid while she was in Dublin - Magt is not very stout
& seems quite deaf John & Willy are very well - When do G & H
come to this part? I hope we shall be good neighbours
When they come, I sent but half the quantity of [unclear][/unclear] ordered
[deletion]say[/deletion] lest it should not be the right kind say was it &
whether I shall send more, as I intend to go to town
occasionally tho' not often, John Chandlee is gone to
Carlow to look at a Mill in that neighbourhood he spent
a day at the Glen [deletion]d[/deletion] with us, D Johnson comes twice a week
regularly to see the children who are all well, we call'd
there yesterday, the Stephens's still keep their house in Daltry
they have 4 little children & the hope of two Gentlemen to lodge
in summer they seem very contented trying to do their best
we were there one day when we went to look at a house

2nd
particularly that one in the Coal yard whether
there was any thing there which could heed
or keep up infection, I was sorry to hear that
Richd had had a relapse indeed he seem'd to
recover surprizingly soon, has my aunt been
able to get out yet & [insertion]for[/insertion] thyself art thou gaining
strength? is Betsy [deletion]tad[/deletion] still with you or is she
gone home to recruit? I seem to know very little
about you & wish to know a great deal, if the
ensuing week be fine I wish Deborah would
put herself into the coach & come to us & tell
me every thing about you, the Mill &c &c how
does my aunt Lydia bear this trying [unclear]weather[/unclear]
Betsy's absence? & how is Betsy herself this [unclear]letter[/unclear]
seems to be full of questions & will want D
to come & answer all, the moving kept
me so busy for many days & being at Glendruid
with Edw, that I had not time to write
sooner, Edw is sadly afflicted with rheumatism
in one arm I suppose owing to his relax'd state
I wd be glad if thou'd send me some sheets
of the poor man's plaister if thou have it to
spare as I think it would be of use to him
how soon I make use of thee!

for ourselves the rent of which was too high & we are
better satisfied to be where we are at a much lower
rent & in a more populous neighbourhood -
This is a lovely bright day tho cold such a day
as makes Ballitore look bright & pleasant, Edw
goes to town to day & takes this so I will bid farewell
with dear love to you all including Mary Doyle & Abby
tell Abby I think she might make time to write me
as my mother is there still attending Selina who is
to go to the country next week
ever thy SB
