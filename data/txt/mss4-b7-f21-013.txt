It would seem strange to me
my dear Friend, to quit Ballitore
without making the very elegant
without noticing the very elegant
lines you left me this Morn.
Yet, what can I say, but that I
wish the Subjects were more worthy
of the good opinion you so kindly
entertain of them - I know nothing
so likely to make People what they
ought to be, as the being told that
those who are really worthy, [underline]suppose[/underline]
them so - Your kind Compliments
will I hope have some effect on us,

We will [underline]endeavor[/underline] to deserve
what you say of us - I know the
Lines came warm from your
heart, therefore they quickly
found their way to mine, - Accept
my best thanks for them, & be
assured there is not a good you
can wish yourself, that I do not
most sincerely wish you -
Farewell! We shall I trust
meet again, but whether in this
World, or the next, God only knows.
World, or the next - God only knows.
Believe me (tho' in the almost
 confusion & hurry) Ever Yrs. very affectionately
[unclear]ML[/unclear]

Mrs Leadbeater
