But to begin at the beginning I ought
first to state that our journey was
performed in a very safe and agreeable
manner and we arrived at the Blarney
station at 2-41 - and were there met
by a covered car from St Anne's and
a donkey cart for our luggage -
After a rather pretty drive of 2 mles
we reached this place this far famed
Doctor Barter's which is situated on a
hill and thus kept clear from the
numerous trees in its neighbourhood
Commanding from its front window
Commanding from its front windows
an uncommonly pretty view - the
sloping undulating ground the
richly tinted woods and plantations
the herds of cattle grazing here and
there and last though not least
"Blarney Castle [deletion]my darlings[/deletion]" off in
the distance - all combine to
form a picturesque and beautiful
landscape -.The house is low
but very extensive in the left [unclear][/unclear]coming[unclear][/unclear]
