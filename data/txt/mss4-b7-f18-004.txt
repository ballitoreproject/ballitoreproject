Selby 8th Mo 18th 1814
My dear Cousin
I now with pleasure embrace this
opportunity of sending thee a few lines by a
person who is at Selby and who is going to
Ireland and will if he possibly can deliver
this letter at Ballitore but if he has not an
opportunity of so doing he will put it into one
of the post Offices. I can assure thee that my
Daughters and myself feel ourselves greatly
obliged to thee for thy Book and letter which we
received safe. I am sorry to hear of cousin
Chandler accident but hope by this time that
she is quite restored to health, am likewise
sorry to hear that Cousin Sallys sight is so bad

I am also sorry to hear of thy nieces death it would
be a great trial to her friends but we must submit
with resignation to the will of the Divine Being
who orders all things for the best tho: at this time
we may not think so. my oldest Son had the
great sorrow of losing his youngest child a fine
Girl about a year and 8 months old she had left
her mother only a few minutes before she was
mist the family immediately went in search of
her my daughter went to the moat which is a
water that goes round the house and there saw
her child without a moments consideration she
jumpt into the water at [insertion]the[/insertion] hazard of her own life
but she was too late to save the infant poor
little one she was quite dead, my Son is likely
to leave Staynor soon Lady [unclear]Petre[/unclear] as advanced all
her Farms very much indeed so much that the

Tentants are not able to live upon them. my Son
Samuel is yet at Nottingham. I am truly sorry
to inform thee of the death of Henry Tuke of York
he was a worthy man and an able Minister the
society will feel deeply their loss he as left an
excellent character he is to be intered to day.
I gave thy love to Cousin Sally she desires hers
in return she is upon a visit at nottingham at
present along with her Brother. Mary Procter is
living and is tollerably well. we are all in good
[unclear][/unclear] which blessing I hope thou [unclear][/unclear]
[unclear][/unclear] and thy relations likewise [unclear][/unclear]
