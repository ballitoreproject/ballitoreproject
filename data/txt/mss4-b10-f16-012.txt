Dear Eliza
I take this opportunity by
Lydia, to send a few lines to you, to ask you
the reason of your long silence; have the charms
of the young year so much attraction for all your
leizure hours, that you have not time or inclination
to put pen to paper for "Auld lang syne" or may be
you are devoting all your spare time, to [insertion]the[/insertion] cultivation
of your mind, to fit you for the arduous task of
opening the minds of your pupils, of whom I hear you
have a great number.
I had not many opportunities to see the approach
of Spring the meeting took up two of my days of
recreation. If you desire to know any thing about
the transactions of the meeting Lydia can tell you
for I was not at any of the meetings of business.
On Sunday last I was out to the Glen to breakfast
we went to take a walk to the Scalp after, it
was a glorious day, and the Mountains looked
delightfull, the fields and the hedges were as

ever I saw them, on account of the recent rains.
What think you would be the greatest loss a man
could meet with in this life, I think it would be
the loss of Memory. Oh! how sad and dreary that
mans life must be, who cannot call up at pleasure
the the various events [insertion]of his life,[/insertion] which have served to make
him pass many a day and hour, in the enjoyment
of friends, when the best feelings of man are drawn
out of the recesses of his heart, where they are ever
hid untill they are brought to light by [insertion]the[/insertion] genial influence
of sincerity.
On Wednesday my Father Edward and the Rain Bow, went
on a fishing excursion to Judy's, She is as well as ever
they also went to Luggelaw, E says he never saw it look
better, it being a beautiful day Charley Carr said he seen
many a May Morning but a finer one never.
I have Sate myself down in the drawing room after
they all went to bed, except Richard who is writing in
the Office, to finish this letter, tomorrow Lydia goes
so I must ramsack my brain for Something to say to you

E & S took a very long ride on Sunday last, round
by Lough Brea and Enniskerry to Glendruid [deletion]to[/deletion] where
they did not arrive till we had finished dinner
They are master & mistress of Brit St house now being
all in Glendruid except Selina.
S Fayle is complaining about your Silence saying
She d'ont know what is come over you, I hope you
may be able to give a satisfactory reason for not writing
to your old friends.
The Girls are talking about an expedition to Lough Brea
 [unclear][/unclear] Luggelaw some Sunday, it is to consist of
about a day - which I think will be rather a
new Sight to the mountains, to have a meeting of friends
in the midst of them, to hold forth to the rocks and heath
18 I slept it out this morning so had not time to fill
this up.
your John
