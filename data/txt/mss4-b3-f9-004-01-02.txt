From Richard Shackleton to Joseph Jacob

Ballitore: 17/6 month 1771

My dear friend,

	+++ I seem not to have any repository of my own from which whence I might impart any Good thing; any spiritual gift. So far from it, I am so exceedingly reduced, so complete a bankrupt in my spiritual circumstances, so poor, so miserable, so beset & embarrassed on all sides, that I never knew, heard, or read of any one like me. I am, or at least feel to myself so weak at times, that I seem as if I could hardly hold, or stick together. Such is the person to whom thou unbosomes thy griefs. Perhaps this short recital of my state compared with thy own feelings may administer some species of relief, when thou findest that others are afflicted, tossed as with tempests, & not-comforted [sic], as well as thyself. Thou rightly & I doubt not experimentally remarkest that effectual relief must come from the Father who seeth in secret. He made us externally & visibly what we are [?], & endued us with our several organs of existence & preservation. It is he who (if we are be as passive under his hand modelling & forming our minds, as we were under the same hand fashioning our bodies, of which we cannot make a single hair white or black) will construct, unite, confirm & strengthen in his own time the various parts of our inward man, & will endue the same with those spiritual sense necessary for is preservation, & for its ability to act properly in the service of its great Creator. O my friend, awfully & wonderfully are we made! My spirit, [pencil page number] 160 & I doubt not but thine & thy beloved Consorts, is often deeply bowed in earnest humble petition that Divine Providence may so steer & pilot our several backs through the dangerous seas of life, that whatever wind from external circumstances blows, whether high or low, prosperous or adverse, whether the waves be rough or smooth, whether storms or calms betide us, we may, enduring all with patience, waiting with great ^quiet^ submission, not without at times a solicitous hope & longing expectation, to be conducted safe at last, into the harbour of eternal rest. Should everything in the voyage be quite easy, commodious & agreeable to our wishes, we might perhaps grow presumptuous & by the interfering of our own carnal wills & wisdom take our bark as it were out of the hands of the good Pilot, & run it aground against some rocks or shelves where it might perish for ever.
	My father seemed some time ago recruiting a little, rode out, & got to our meeting here, but has been worse again. He is ^so^ variously held, better & worse, that it is hard to represent his situation: but on the whole, it does not appear likely that he will recover. However Infinite Goodness, in the participation of which his soul delighted, does not fail him now in the time of utmost need. What I have gone through in the prospect of such a Help-meet in the discipline of the Church being taken from my head in this day, [change of ink] the Lord only knows. This super added to various other troubles & besetments [sic] is as much sometimes as I can well bear. At other times, things sit lighter, & the natural vivacity (like a little temporary sunshine) breaks thro the cloud. +++
	I am, with dear love,
		thy affectionate friend & kinsman
