30 Aungier street 2nd of 7th Month 1818.
Dear Sarah,
I received the last & most acceptable
of thy letters, dated the 3d & 4th of 5th month, & am now going
to answer it on the day I promised thee. It was the most
acceptable of thy letters to me as containing more of thy own
remarks & observations than any of the others, & I hope thou
wilt continue this practice in all thy future letters to me.
I hope this delightful weather has been of advantage to Deborah's
health, & that she takes proper advantage of it by
taking early morning exercise. - I suppose thou & thy
sister Lydia & Mary Davis have also taken advantage of
these mornings to return & establish your good health.
How are you getting on with Young, & what do you
think of him? It is a kind of reading much better suited
to winter-evenings than summer-mornings - I knew
M. Davis would be delighted as thou said she was with
the meeting of the Bible Society; I wish she had heard
Orpen speak at the Deaf & Dumb Meeting, & she would
be enraptured I think, & catch something of his own
ardour & animation. I was never so delighted with
any thing else [deletion][/deletion] of the S[unclear][/unclear]. - I am glad thou
hast been reading some of the writings of our friend Rush,
he was a true [deletion]patriot[/deletion] [insertion]republican[/insertion], a true patriot, & last & best of
all, a true Christian. - His principles will, I think soon
care; if thou hast, tell me so freely, & I hope I shall not be so presumptuous
in future - I saw my uncle Christy & his son Joseph here lately. The latter
went to Limerick since with my uncle Harvey. They brought me a letter from
my uncle Dawson reviewing his visitation to go there [deletion]next month[/deletion], which I
intend to next month, & hope for the pleasure of E. Alexander's company.
We had Doctor Orpen's company for a great part of the [deletion]time[/deletion] [insertion]evening[/insertion] at the last meeting
of the Quaternion. He had just returned from a visit to the school at
[unclear]Abbylase[/unclear] in the Queen's county established in [unclear]Pertaloyze's[/unclear] plan to which he had
been invited by Lord de [deletion]Visci[/deletion] Vesci, James has continued latterly to write to
me so regularly every week, that I have taken pity on him & have determined
to treat him in the same manner, & shall accordingly write to him every week
that I receive a letter from him, - In his last letter, he mentioned that he
dined at my uncle James's in company with one of the candidates for the city
of Limerick, Thomas Rice, a very agreeable & gentlemanly man who is greatly
liked & was invited from London to stand for Limerick. He has greatly interested
himself latterly about prisons, & corresponds with my uncle Harvey. Tuthill
who [deletion]had[/deletion] was formerly the popular [deletion]ma[/deletion] candidate, fell out with the Independent
party & declined standing in consequence, but is now greatly displeased
at their sending for Rice; & such is his perverseness, or rather malice, that he
has determined in every manner he possibly can, to prevent Rice's success.
If Rice does conclude to contest the representation with [unclear]Vercher[/unclear] "says James "I believe
my father, & indeed most of the friends in the city will vote for him." Thomas Todhunter

be acted upon in England. I have great hopes from our new
Parliament; several worthless men are turned out & useful
patriotic men admitted in. The public spirit displayed in
London, Southwarks & Westminster was most extraordinary.
In defiance of all ministerial corruption & bribery, there
was not a single court candidate returned for London. Sir
Samuel Romilly will very probably be a member for Westminster;
he is eminent for his endeavours to reform the penal
laws. - Your schools still continue to flourish & prosper.
Education for ever! - Hast thou heard any tidings since of
the 7th number of the Friend of Peace. I shall shortly be
writing to Jacob Harvey, & should like to know before I send
the letter whether it is found, that I may determine whether
to write for another copy of it or not. Joseph Fayle is pretty
well now; but has not yet removed to Dunleary. - When
are we to meet you at Poulapouca? Do you mean to wait
until Joseph Fayle has removed to the Salt-works. Joseph Humphreys
& Doctor Orpen gone to Cork, whither they intend going next
month & Edward Alexander & I gone to the North, which
perhaps will be in next month also? - I hope thou hast
read Jacob Harvey's letter to me which I sent lately to Sally
White; if not I shall send it to thee, [deletion]after[/deletion] where I have
answered it. - I suppose you have heard all about our [insertion]two[/insertion] public
meetings [unclear]val. off[/unclear]. this Education Society, & of the members
of the Deaf & Dumb Institution. I hear the speeches made
at the latter are to be published; if so I intend to get half
a dozen of the papers & shall send you one. Doctor Orpen's
speech was a noble one, & we all heard him. [unclear]Sanbry[/unclear] spoke
at both meetings, & Thos. Knott at the first. - Please to [unclear]shew[/unclear]
& William Fennell returned yesterday from the North, where they had
spent a few weeks; so you may expect Wm. Todhunter back again soon,
as it was Thomas's absence which detained him. I dined yesterday at
Peter Lefanu's, they are all very well. Lizzy is in the county Wicklow. I
attend Doctor Wade's lectures at the botanical garden regularly, but
have scarcely any companion with me. - Joseph Fayle & I took the
other morning a walk along the Dodder which he said was a favourite
one of thine. - Now, Sarah, I believe I must stop, partly for want of
time, as I have two more letters to write - one to my brother, another to Jacob
Harvey, & it is now half past 12, & partly for want of more to say, altho if
I had time to think, I might perhaps fill the sheet completely, & partly
because my writing is becoming more unintelligible on account of being
crossed; I hope thou wilt be able to make it out, & reply to it soon. So
with love to you all I conclude
Wilt thou [underline]excite[/underline] Deborah
to write to me. I believe she
requires some stimulus.
Edward Alexander requested to
be remembered to thee.
thy faithful, affectionate friend
Thos Fisher

to thy mother the following extracts from James's letters:
"6 Mo. 13. My grandmother is much better, she has been removed
from her own room down to the front-parlour for the
convenience of her taking exercise, which she has done in a small
carriage about the lawn, drawn by a man - this, it is thought,
has much contributed to her improvement - her spirits are remarkably
good these some days past. Indeed altogether,
she is astonishingly better much more so than I believe
was ever anticipated - I mean to go & see her this evening,
my father still sleeps in the country." 6 Mo. 18." I saw my grandmother
yesterday for the first time - she looks astonishingly
well considering her situation - she is really now a very handsome
old woman, she is very much improved, & can say some words
but finds it notwithstanding very hard to make herself
understood - she is drawn about in the lawn almost every
fine day - this causes her spirits not to decline, they
are astonishingly good - she frequently laughs very heartily at
what is said." 6 Mo. 27. "My grandmother is not so well for
these few latter days as she had been, she has got a cold. My
father still lodges at Richmond." - How is thy uncle
Abraham? - I send this in a parcel with this letter
the 11th number of the "Friend of Peace" & a Discourse delivered
on the Deaf & Dumb at New York, which I lately
received from Jacob Harvey, I also received from him
another New York Magazine which I would send thee
now, only that Joseph Fayle has it, copying out a most
beautiful & finely written article on History. I hope
thou hast no objection to my putting these pamphlets in [underline]thy[/underline]
