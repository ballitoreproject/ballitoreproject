Clonmel 13/3 month 1783

My dear Fathers kind letter I received this morning, the friends left us yesterday morning for Garriroan [sic] side, in order to visit families there, my Husband only returned late last evening from the Spinning House, & set off this after^noon^ with his Brother John, in order to accompany the friends to Youghal, as Guides, & to be at the Province meeting there, I should have liked to have gone there too, but it seems imprudent for both my Husband & me to be absent together from our young, complicated sort of a family; & especially as we have not a suitable stayed, trusty Person to take charge of it. We had satisfaction in those choice Womens company, & I hope experienced some degree of improvement thereby, & that we did not receive more, must be attributed to the ground of our own Hearts not being clean enough to witness a growth in the right seed, adequate to those showers of Celestial rain: But I hope resolutions were raised, (may they prove stable) to apply ourselves more diligently to weeding the ground, that this seed immortal may have room to grow: Our dear friends were much favoured first day morning Ruth first, clothed with matter & divine authority, ^if possible^ to the awakening the carlessing, rousing the luke-warm & comforting the Mourners in Sion. afterwards [sic] Anne in a lively, awful testimony, & lastly Ruth in a power prayer: she said she believed it was a farewel [sic] testimony, & so I believe it was, yesterday mo^r^ning at breakfast Anne had a comfortable opportunity to speak to Becky & me in much love, particularly I think to Becky, & dropped some good advice to me: I find the testimony of inspired friends accord with my own conscience that there is deficiency in me, as Ruth said to us to consider how much time had been afforded to us, (my Husband & me) & how little had been spent in the service of God: I could not find out by them whether they felt any draft towards you, they seemed to wish for a release: I wish their labours may be blessed to our meeting, I often thought, we were searched as with lighted Candles: they were very cheerful & pleasant with us, I think ^of^ Ruths hearty comfortable laughs with pleasure, she & her dear companion were so free & agreeable: they reckoned, they had three Landladys. We have had letters from Brother Robert with an account of their safe Landing, were at Whitehaven with Robert Valentine, & lodgd [sic] at Joseph Pipers [sic], I am obliged by Anita [?] Sparks [sic] remembrance of me, if I can well, intend writing a few lines to her, but perhaps this humour may pass away, I suppose I was vexed when I wrote about the Garden, for I am put out of humour when I see it neglected, & then it seems as if this neglect was irremediable, & this encreases my vexation (those are perhaps some of the Briers & thorns that choke the good seed, & renders it so unfruitful) but since my last more Peas have been sown, (we have a crop of peas & beans above ground) parsnips & Carrots & other seeds sown & a hot bed made in the place Mother ordered, I am much obliged to her for her hints & advice about it, I read my Gardeners Calendar, wrote by R. Weston, which thou sent me, & follow its [sic] directions, as far as I well can, not being supplyed [sic] with the conveniences & materials for those nice parts of Gardening he mentions, as to gravelling the walks it is more than I expect this Spring, but intend to have them turned & cleaned.
	My Uncle Ben is not at home, being with the friends at Garriroan side, I rejoice at the good account thou sends of the North, and wish prosperity to this good Work of harmony & concord, & that our dear friend may be preserved from all danger, & the malice of the undermining Adversary be frustrated, & his devices turned backward.
	I have thought of late of this dear friend with warm affection, & much solicitude, feeling a degree of my ancient tender regard & friendship for him, who was like a Father to me, & an instrument of much Good to my Soul: tho I am so fallen short, yet at times I am ready to weep when I remember zion [sic].
	I hardly know what to say about this lease, Sam says that is the part Brother Abraham has he left there, & he has the other part he brought to get attested I think, but I cannot get it right in my head, I wish he would write himself about it, Robert Dudley he reckoned did nothing bout it. 	I have no Ranunculus roots, having given em to Sister Hannah, when I thought I was to move to the House Uncle Ben occupies, & expected to have no Garden.
	Yesterday Billy Dudley was seized again with another stroke similar to the former, he sleeps much, but can speak & stir, & is quite sensible I understand when awake: poor Mary but very middling herself.
	I am concerned to find Brother Chandlee, has been ill, & poor Debby so cumbered, I want to ^write^ her, I am sitting up to write this, as I get so little leisure or quiet by day, & sitting up late disagrees with me: therefore cannot well practice it often. I am pleased to find Mother is mending, the weather continues severe.
	With dear love to you all, I conclude thy
		dutiful & affectionate
			Daughter
		Margaret Grubb

I should be obliged to thee to seal & forward the enclosed
