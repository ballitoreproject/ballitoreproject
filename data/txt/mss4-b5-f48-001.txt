Dublin 5th mo 25th 1876
Dear Friend
Mary Leadbeater.
Thy Letter of the 9th [unclear]last[/unclear], was just handed me
from Home, I really do not recollect thy writeing me
before, phaps I was at the period thou alludes to
I was at one time very anxious to get the remainder
of thos [unclear]lively[/unclear] property disposed of, for the benefit of
his Creditors, but they, [underline]all[/underline], would not agree to bear me
harmless, therefore was obliged to abandon it, I may now
inform thee since the last dividend made by Aunt
Newsom has [unclear]remunerated[/unclear] to her late Husbands effects
Newsom has administered to her late Husbands effects
which cuts me out, and which was done for that
Intention; I am much sencere respects
Thy assured Friend
John Fennels
