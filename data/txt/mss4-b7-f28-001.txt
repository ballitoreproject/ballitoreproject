Ballitore 11th/3d mo 1807
My dear Mary and William
intends for Dublin in the morning & as I know
thou wishes to oblige thy friends I send thee
my Watch to hand to Frank Johnson to
regulate; it stops at different times in the
day or might shake it & it will go again, it
has been lately clean'd by Buchanan in Golledge
Green to no good purpose if thou can bring it home
with thee & [unclear][/unclear] it's expences. [insertion]it will oblige very much[/insertion] Please to go to
Warereytt Boaks & tell him to give thee 3 1/4 yards
of the same Muslin which he sent me before
& place it to my accompt also that I gave
Marys letter to her Aunt Abby that it was
particularly grateful to her to hear from Mary
& that she would answer it only it agrees so
badly
3 yards Bell wire
Barn Strop
one dozen paper
[unclear][/unclear] bordering
[deletion]one p[/deletion]
2 pr large Mens stockings
2 oz Rochelle Salts

badly with her stooping to write she is still very
delicate & I fear not likely to be much better. She
requests her love to be handed to her Brother & the
Children. K C Fowler was here last night which
seemed to revive Abby for the time but now they
are gone & poor Abby seems to loose ground
again. Please to put the inclosed into the Office
for A Wright. I wish thee would make haste
& come home to us several are anxiously
wishing thy return. John the Farmer desires
his love to thee with mine: mine also please
to hand to Betty Johnson & her Girls farewell
dearly Jane Thomas
