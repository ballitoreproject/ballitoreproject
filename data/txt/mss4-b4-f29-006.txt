Ballitore 28th of 9th mo 1808
My dear Aunt
I received thy very kind letter
this morning & am very much obliged
to thee for thy love for me. My
Mother got a note from Dr Levance
to day as it was too wet for him to
come out. She is better & does not
have the head ache so much, & eats a
bit of colliflower every day. I am
very sorry there is any necessity for
thee going to Dr Richards at all but
hope nothing that will give thee pain
that will be needful. Mary & Anne
are obliged to thee, & send their love,
I am going to send out the lag, My
Mother rests well, she did not get
upto day, she took Cheltmam salts
this morning. Hannah has not got
her second tooth yet, I will write
a little [unclear]taste[/unclear] to Margaret if I
have time I hope thou will answer
this, my dear Aunt farewell I remain
thy affectionate Niece D Leadbeater
