Waterford 18th Sixth month 1787
My dear Molly
I was much gratified by the
presence of my uncle & should have felt additional
satisfaction if my Cousins had effected their design
of coming to Waterford I hope their indisposition is
ere now entirely removed I purposed sending this
by my uncle but not having set about it in
proper time I was obliged to defer writing until
a more favorable opportunity which is now presented
our old Friend Eliza kindly undertaking the delivery
of these few lines how I was delighted at seeing
her again shall not attempt to describe but appeal
to thy own present feelings - She possesses in an
eminent degree along with her many amiable qualities
that which we have so frequently admired in old
acquaintances - her own peculiar manner has suffered
no alteration she is still to be acknowledged the same

In thy last thou mentions having heard matters differently
represented respecting D Penrose's affair which induces
me to attempt a statement of his case having a better
opportunity of knowing it than many & not the inclination
to misrepresent it as some, have evidently displayed
To prove that [underline]her wealth[/underline] was not his object I shall just
remark that I have often heard him express how he
was captivated by her agreeable disposition several
years ago when on a visit here which he said more than
made amends for her want of personal beauty these praises
were long before he had any prospect of his late intimacy
which was occasioned by a casual interview in the
Country whither he went as an escort - the warm
reception he then met with gave birth to a wish for
a closer connexion, which he would then openly avow
had he not been strictly enjoined to privacy [underline]by her[/underline]
His punctual obedience of her commands (which by the bye
is the invariable duty of all the sighing tribe) gave such
a clandestine air to his proceedings as was generally
looked on as unjustifiable when matters began to come to light
He by these means converted into most inveterate enemies

two females who before had been in profession his unshaken
Friends whether one was jealous at not being consulted on
the occasion as she herself declared or the other was
piqued at his not discovering charms where no human
being could find a trace of any thing pleasing I cannot
pretend to determine - However their influence & earnest
endeavours were employed to traduce his character by
the most shameful modes & I fear they have been too successful
I have known them to deny some aspersions which could be incontestibly
proved had their original with them but as
all parties were of one family he did not chuse to
push the explanation to an extremity - A Rival was
absolutely egged on by their persuasions who enjoyed
but a small degree of their favor before & since that juncture
I have heard them declare they did not care who gained
the prize so DP was disappointed - The Youth
who was set up in opposition to [unclear]Dan[/unclear] is now convinced
that he was only made subservient to their vindictive
disposition — Since Death has placed an insuperable
bar to the union of the ill-fated pair the Unnatural
Uncle has been prompted to use his endeavours to prevent
Dan's enjoying what the liberality of his best beloved designed

to bestow. Her Will was made privately
to prevent her being influenced by thou about her
and when she declared it a short time before
her decease, in order to prevent its being litigated
her [underline]kind Friends[/underline] expressed "so much dissatisfaction
that she was thereby induced to annex a Codicil
in her Uncles favour in order to pacify him
So that interested motives were displayed on their
side rather than on poor Dans — The reason I have
been so diffuse on this subject is to comply with
Dans desire as I suspect he has been informed
the Ballitore Folk were among others prepossessed
against him, Yet notwithstanding my friendship
for him is great I hope thou will do me the justice
to believe the above is devoid of partiality —
Hast thou heard since of poor Baxter I was much concerned
at his misfortune Perhaps the news shortened his
mothers days
Present me affectionately to all at home
& be assured that I am
thine sincerely
William Rayner
