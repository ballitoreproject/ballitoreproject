My dear E
The carman has just call'd &
I would thank thee to send by him
next week if thou can get them 1/2 done
of feathers to fill a bolster I am not
particular that they should be the
best provided they are [unclear]sweet[/unclear]
Mary went to Monkston yesterday
She is very gay & pleasant
EJ spent part of yesterday here
He goes to Claremont to day I hope
you are all well - Edw wrote
to J [unclear]R[/unclear] about the boy & I believe will
get him ever thy SB how did D

the man waits
I believe Lucy will go on 7th day next

I wish Selina was with her she is very delicate
but this is between ourselves
