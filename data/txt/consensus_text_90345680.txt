Aunt Ellen surprised us by dropping
in in the course of the morning
She had just been lodging hunting
accompanied by Miss Holland without
success and was just in time to engage
those next door to Aunt Liddy for one
month. It was very pleasant to see her,
I took a walk with Mrs Griffin who
is a nice quiet little woman -
Came away by the 6Â½ train, Aunt
Liddy saw me off and intends if
nothing prevents to bring Mrs Griffin
over to see Bray and Fassaroe next
Tuesday -

Mrs Griffin [underline]did[/underline] come in spite
of the showery morning - I met
them with the car and really they
