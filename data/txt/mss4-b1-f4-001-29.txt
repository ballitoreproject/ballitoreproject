E. S. to her Husband.
Ballitore, 5th of Firstmonth 1784.
*** It give me satisfaction that thou feelest support
and a belief that thou art in thy place.
I am willing to give up thy
company, (which is very desirable to us,)
for the promotion of righteousness,
as I appear now to be of very little use
but to stick by the staff,
and keep our outward things together as well as I can. It is a strength
and comfort to those who are going off the stage of action, to hear of
those who are in the prime of life for service in the church, devoting
themselves to it; and particularly those of one's own family. I wish
Samuel and Margaret's establishment in every good word & work;
and apprehend the way to be so, is to keep low, and humbly dependant
on that all-sufficient Power, which can enable the striplings,
like David, to make war successfully against the Philistine nature
both in themselves and others, steadily labouring that self may be of
no reputation: and then I doubt not but they will be prosperous & useful
in their generation, and have wisdom afforded them to train up their dear children,
both by example and precept, in the nurture & admonition of the Lord.
E. S.
