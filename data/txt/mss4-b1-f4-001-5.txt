R. S to his Daughter Sarah.
Clonmel 7th of Ninthmonth month 1780
*** It would not be grateful, in every sense of the word,
to force Mary away with us: thou must learn resignation and patience.
I hope it will not be long before you meet with joy; that joy and
placid serenity which can only be had under the canopy of conscious
innocence. The contrast beclouds the mind, and prevents any satisfaction
arising from the most pleasing, natural gratifications. Conscious
guilt gives every object, how agreeable soever in itself, a gloomy, sable
hue: it damps, it depresses, it debases. By the mercy of our great
and common Benefactor, I hope and believe all my dear children
are preserved, in a good measure, from any great mixture of this
alloy. May the holy leaven have room to continue so to operate, that
the whole lump may be sanctified; then the joy will be full. ***
