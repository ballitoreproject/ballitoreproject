My dear James,
	++ I do feel a renewal of (may I venture to say sacred) amity with thee
++ Satan besure wants to have all you young people, that have turned tail to him, in order that he may sift all the good out of you - nay his impudence is such, that he stands (the old accuser of the brethren) at the right hand of Joshua [220 in pencil, top left of page] the approved, the acknowledged, the experienced, dignified servant ++ The meeting on the whole I think was much favoured, more than a backsliding people had any right to expect - We had a good deal of the pop, pop, pop like the firing of undisciplined would-be soldiers, one after another, instead of the united concordant, certain sound of a well-disciplined army - but there was nothing not more, if so much of this evil as usual. Edmund Gurney threw out to this spirit, as a tub to a whale, the consideration of the weighty expression of the solid conclusion of our ancestors on matters, which were debated amongst them viz. "It is our sense & judgment &c" Ten thousand pounds was ordered to be raised for procuring a proper place, and erecting proper edifices for the holding the yearly men's & women's meetings - This matter having been previously settled by a committee was carried through the yearly meeting with great una^ni^mity - a remarkable solemnity attended - it was a baptizing season to my spirit - for some how or other my heart is attached by a manifold cord, which seems to acquire every year additional strength, to this great & most general representation of our religious society. ++ ^Direct to me at Coalbrook Dale, Where E: Pim & I expect to spend a few days on our return^ [crossed out in pencil, not by author] I know not when we shall leave this city - I wait the motions of that increasingly dear friend: yet a wife bound to me by the strong ties of natural & spiritual affection, thou may think attracts me forcibly - but I cannot leave my beloved friend without a proper convey - her honesty, her simplicity, her fidelity & her obedience manifested in publick & private communications here have strengthened my attachment to her - no ill-grounded shame, no false delicacy, no slavish fear, no saving of dear self from mortification & contempt, have prevented her, though of the weaker sex & of exquisite sensibility from throwing in her mite into the precious treasury, accumulating for the establishment of Truth upon earth +++ Thy sister & others my particular friends there, too many to particularize, share my lasting affection. And now that I am come to the subject of love, I will drop anchor there, & bid thee, my dear James, affectionately farewell
R.S.
