Miss Mary Shackleton
An Admirer of your Poetry thinks it
incumbent on him to inform you that there is at present
in this City a Gentleman who having got copies of most of
your Productions, intends on going to London next Autumn
or Winter to hand them to a Bookseller, which he wou'd
have done six Months ago as, he tells me, only he left them
by mistake behind him when going to England last. The
Name of the Bookseller he would not let me have, fearing
I wou'd stop his Intentions, & insisted that I wou'd keep
this secret which I would not consent to except not
divulging his name which is of little consequence. He says
it has been his Intention these many years to do so, but
he waited to see whether you wou'd publish before him, his
motive not being sinister as he has made [deletion]of[/deletion] a promise of
bestowing them to the Bookseller. I wou'd therefore advise
[insertion]that[/insertion] you should forthwith revise what you have by you, &
whatever you have not endeavour to procure, & to suppress
what may not be altogether so correct as your latter
Pieces, then to publish them.
I shall add no more only to request you
will not despise this Information as it comes from one
who is proud to be a warm well-wisher to you & who
shall on this occasion subscribe himself

PS You know very well how agreeable your
Poems wou'd prove to your friends when their collected
