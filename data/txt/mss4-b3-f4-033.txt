Clonmel 2d month 18th 1790

My dear uncle

	I was thinking for above a ^week^ back of writing to thee & wished for leisure so to do; for my heart was often warmed with such a renewal of affection for thee & thine as as [sic] to render a suspension of converse rather unpleasant; at the time that it convinced me the life was more than even such pleasant morsels as sometimes are permitted to cherish & feed it  Thine however of the 11th instant was like they former epistolary visits instructive & strengthening & urged me gratefully & early to acknowledge it  so now Joshua Eves of Edenderry being to leave this tomorrow morning for Montrath (where I conclude a letter may find thee) I set about it 
	Yes my dear uncle through the fresh extension of infinite mercy that debt was paid to Kinsale  it was like the rolling away of a great stone from a wells mouth, to the springing up of which something in me was disposed to sit & sing, as if the days work was done, so great was the rest, after that sore toil & travel, wherein I seemed to be under every body & under every thing!  but instead of this an old exercise ^& burden^ of more than usual weight returned with a gracious offer of relief, if my own will was sufficiently given ^up^ & my dedication more perfect than heretofore 
This though a few weeks since appeared as impossible as almost any thing in nature, now was esteemed a mercy from which I dared not to turn away, & as the matter ripened fast upon ^my^ mind I informed our friends at last monthly ^meeting^ that it seemed as if ^it^ would conduce to my peace after the next yearly meeting in London to step over to Dunkirk to visit the few ^friends^ there, also to go again to Holland & as far as Pyrmont in Germany.
Friends took ^up^ the matter for me & since some of them have (I beleive [sic]) come under a weight about it, I feel myself greatly releived [sic] & am so involved in family cares &c that when I recollect the box I am in, it often astonishes me & that I know of no companion save my dear 

RG whose love to the cause, & endearing kindness to me will probably preserve ^me^ from being quite destitute  If it is right (as I conclude it is) for more to be yoked to this service I trust the master himself will put them forth & make them willing to shew themselves without much soliciting from us 
Our last P. Meeting at Cork was much more satisfactory (I beleive [sic] in the general) than the preceding one  our four english visitants were all there & except A. Hunt, publickly laboured according to their respective ^abilities^ but she poor woman was very low till her mind settled to request a meeting particularly with the youth which was agreed to ^&^ held after we left Cork  Dear R. Jacob was acceptably ^there^ & appeared to be an anointed gospel minister in public & private religious opportunities  If we were together a little I could tell thee much ^about^ this said beloved child in the service but this ^is^ a line of communication in which I dont like to be very free on such subjects  so much however I may say that he does not mutter as he did over thy fireside but lifts up his voice with life, energy & that holy trembling which tends to true exaltation Israel 
Ah my dear uncle how precious are such babes in Christ! how all thats good within ^us^ wrestles for their preservation from the craftiness of a subtle adversary & the floods poured out of the mouth of the Dragon after the woman which hath the manchild  The display of an Almighty hand in bringing into such usefulness a few visitted [sic] children in this land & that there are amongst them men who are likely to stand faithful in defence of the great cause of truth & righteousness on earth ^is marvellous^ yet let not this rejoicing occasion our prayers to cease, that the Lord of the harvest may send forth more labourers into his harvest for my spirit at times is humble in the beleif [sic] that the fields in many places are already white
To thyself I may say that in the German empire this vision is clear & yet peradventure I may return with my ^from it^ pitcher [word crossed out] ^empty^ ashamed & confounded  if that should even be the case my faith in the divine intention concerning that country seems at present as if it could not be shaken by any defect in outward circumstances respecting my little movements  Our dear E. Pim is a precious companion in spiritual travel  I read her thy letter & she shared with me in the gratification to be derived from it  Our ever dear Margaret & honest S. Lees are plodding on in a family visit to friends in this meeting which commenced yesterday for which they received the entire unity of their friends (who know how to say amen) at our last m. meeting  They have no companion & if any choose to join in stocks with them they are not to wait, but to be applied to, which seems a good plan for expediting their business  It is a great comfort to us that LL has such an experienced skillful & feeling mother as ^our^ dear M.G. & I have no doubt but as the proposal of the visit had the best sanction so the performance will also  We had a few days since a letter from my dear father & an addition from sister E. The families were pretty well except mother who has a bad cough & a great thirst but she gets out to meeting: they say that dear L.M. lets them hear his voice sometimes in public to their comfort  We had ^also^ a letter a few days since from S. Smith he was at Bridg [sic] Water & was going for Cornwal [sic], well in health & had John Hipsley [?] a valueable man (with whom I am well acquainted) for a companion 
EB & AH being here, with the aforementioned concerns renders it improbable that you will be visitted [sic] at the ensuing meeting at Mt.rath by Clonmel friends  Indeed tis hard for me to get so much time as to write even so much to one of my first rate correspondants [sic]

Our next meeting for the province is to be at Waterford where we hope to see thee  My love is so free in ^its^ the course to thy family individually, that I hardly know how to particularize ^them^ except my dear Aunt whose care for me I feel  I am ^in^ debt to Abram & Sally & I love to be so  Our mutual friend M. Dudley is neither very well nor very ill but lively in her spirit: we have been together this evening at S. Davidss with the friends  Betty Grubb is a very agreeable addition to our family & aunt (her mother) has kindly offered one of her daughters for companion to our sweet Jane & during our absence in the summer should we be permitted to go  Well my dear uncle I must say farewel which with a heart replenished ^by^ true love (wherein my R.G. writes) I can feelingly say & subscribe myself thy affectionate S R Grubb
