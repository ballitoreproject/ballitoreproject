244 it is easy to recommend resignation; but when the trial comes home to
us, and the exquisitely tender feelings of nature are affected; then
to say with the heart, "Thy will be done"! is to overcome indeed.
and yet such a victory over humanity may be gained, and is often gained
by the Lord's children, in their pilgrimage through this life; and being
strengthened by His love and His power, they can, in all humility
and gratitude, kiss the rod which chastises them, and bless the hand,
which, in perfect, though unsearchable wisdom, both gives and takes
away. Our sympathy with thee, my dear child, is strong; and our hope
I trust, is not of the hypocrite, which perisheth; our hope is, that
thou wilt, in the Lord's time, be raised out of those pits of distress,
and having been made a witness of deliverance, wilt have experimentally
to testify to the sufficiency of that arm of everlasting
245 Power, which could deliver in such sort, and to encourage other
travelers in the like tributed path, to hold on their way **
Thy son Abraham is in good health, through favor of
Providence; a fine, sensible, well-disposed boy, who, I trust,
will be a comfort and assitance to his worthy father and thee.
When I speak of comfort, I must consequently think of our dear
S.R.G. whom to have so near thee must be pleasing & strengthening.
