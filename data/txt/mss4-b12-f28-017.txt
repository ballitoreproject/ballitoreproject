To My Mother.
Like dew upon a Summer's flower
A Mother's blessing falls
How well remembered childhoods hours
How sweet the thought it calls
Bless you my mother dear
As you have blessed me
May Heaven in Health yet mercy a year
Spare me this wish of thee

My dearest Mama
I was very glad to get
thy letter this morning - & to hear
how you all are all getting
on. - I do hope thou wilt
be able to go Fassaroe -
that it will do thee good
It was better to accept these
be always refusing Uncle
Ed & Aunt Hildah I
think when we have settled
down here we ought to get
them for a few days - I
think Lucie will be able to
go with them for she wants
a change to [underline]quiet[/underline] she has
got none of it since she went
up -
I am [underline]not overdone[/underline] with
work what ever way I have
it managed I get through
it without much bother.
