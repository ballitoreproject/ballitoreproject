			R. S. to his Daughter Mary.

				Ballitore 29th of Eighthmonth 1779.
		*** Paul Kenna’s family have been in a fever. The mother recovered; the father’s state still doubtful; the son, their only child, the prop and comfort of the family, a fine, hopeful youth has just now expired. Surely this is a vale of tears. We had need to take care of health while we enjoy it: we ought to be exceedingly thankful for it, as well as for the tranquillity [sic], public and domestic, and those necessaries and conveniences of life which we still enjoy.” **

	Soon after the date of the above, the daughter to whom it was addressed was seized with a fever in Dublin, at the house of the kind family-friends, Joseph and Elizabeth Pike, where she experienced such kindness as claimed and excited strong emotions of gratitude. Her mother and sister went to her, and attended her through a dangerous  illness. Her anxious father on this occasion thus expresses himself.
