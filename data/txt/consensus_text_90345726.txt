was very pleasant. Ned Grubb went to town
with him so we felt rather lonely without
them both and had to content ourselves
with the [insertion][unclear][/unclear][/insertion] Spectator and Cowper - It was
to windy to go out, so we sat reading
and working instead - Philip who breakfasted
here came over to tea bringing
with him J Perry - Louisa told him
his fortune . and made us laugh - we
also had some music and songs. Papa
did not come out until after tea.
They both staid the night but were
off before breakfast the next morning.
26 Tuesday - Windy again and another
day in the house. Louisa is to go
to-morrow so we are making the most
of her -
