Gone, my sweet boy, the rapid wheels
Have whirl'd thee from me far away
And what thy mother's brain feels
It is a mother best can say.
Now I no more thy ringlets bright
Clustering around thy forehead spy,
[deletion]Nor that[/deletion] [deletion]While/deletion] [insertion]Nor see[/insertion] home felt [insertion]&[/insertion] uncheck'd delight
shine[deletion]s[/deletion] in thy lovely, laughing eye
When past were four revolving years
Then to thy parents bosoms prest
[insertion]Oh[/insertion] How [deletion]sweet were thy[/deletion] delicious [insertion]were thy[/insertion] tears
How soft the sobs which heav'd thy breast.
Blush not at this although thy form
Has left the stripling state behind
Ever be thine the bosom warm.
Ever be thine the feeling mind

In joy we met, in love we part
In joy & love to meet again,
So hopes the fond, the trusting heart
And soothes the smart of present pain
27/8 mo: 1817
I cannot
No more I hear thy step advance
No more thy pleasant voice I hear
I send around the pensive glance
But my loved Richard is not near
