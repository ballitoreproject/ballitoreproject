Dear Sir

	with a gratefull [sic] heart I acknowledge your repeated favours, they are all respected and have taken due Effect; my list is much Encreased thereby, and I have no Doubt of Success on the Contests;
	Sorry should I be, did my worthy friend, think I required him to ask favours from those, to whom he ought not to make application; I only meant, where you could with propriety solicit your friends; my return, shall be a Conscientuous [sic] discharge of my Duty; unconnected with party or Faction, unshackled with Employments, Void of ambition or a lust for Earthly honours, I shall Endeavour to Support the Character of an honest Man, the Noblest Work of God
	Present my affectionate regards to all your family, & I hope your Sister is recovered
		I am
		Dear Sir
		with gratitude & Esteem
		your obliged Humble Servant
		Edward Newenham
