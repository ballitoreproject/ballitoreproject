Richard Shackleton to Joseph Jacob

Ballitore: 3/9 month 1769

Joseph Jacob
Dear Cousin

	+++ I think ye did very well to set on foot a monthly meeting visit in your province. I cannot say, but I would like to be where there is much good company: I would like sometimes to take a trip unnoticed, & see how my brethren fare: if I could get a little of the spirit too [sic], it could not but prove acceptable. My dear friend, Providence knows all hearts, & sees where I am, with more just precision of view than I see myself. I trust He knows that not the love of the world in any of its shapes confines & limits me in every respect. But the great Lord of the Seasons allots them to his inward, as well as outward creation with wise inequality. My winter is long indeed. You, my dear friend, joined together in every near & dear covenant, may you experience often the tender buddings of the Spring, & the warm beams of the advanced Sun of Righteousness, that in due season ye may bring forth fruit to the consolation of your own souls, & the edification of others! as for me, I seem at a stand: but my prayers are often fresh & fervent for the preservation of the visited of the Lord, that the destroying angel may not prevail against them. This is the burden of my cry. For many have been called, & made some advances right steps forward, yet for want of diligence in retirement, too often & too long together off their watch, an enemy has crept in ^has^ industriously picked [page number] 144 up much of the good seed, & sown his tares, which perhaps do not immediately appear, but grow up also in their season. By this means the precious seed is either altogether choked, or there is such a mixture as renders the heavenly visitation in a great measure ineffectual to ourselves, &, in its consequences unprofitable to others. The great antidote against this bane is Retirement. It was, my dear friends, in my heart (on my bed I believe) & now recurs to my thoughts to recommend to you Retirement. Generally every day allot some little portion of valuable time to this valuable purpose. Perhaps the cool of the evening, (the hour when our Creator chose to commune with our first parents), the time between day-light & candle-light, or at other more convenient season, either together or apart, as ye may best feel your minds disposed, step from the world, & in some private place wait on the Lord Almighty. I dare venture to say ye will find Him near to your comfort, & to your incouragement [sic] in this practice. Ye will also find near to you the spirits of your absent friends, & a facility to put up your petitions for your tender offspring. By this means ye will keep up the daily sacrifice, your spirits will be refreshed & enabled to go through the offices of life with more sweetness & alacrity, & will from time to time be purged from those defilements which adhere, as it were, by contact, as we necessarily pass along ^pass along^ ++

I am, dear Joseph,
thy sincere friend
Richard Shackleton
