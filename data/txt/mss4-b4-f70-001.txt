My dear Friend, ~ Thy cordial[insertion]i[/insertion]ty towards me, renewed [underline]latterly[/underline]
has encouraged me thus to address thee, which I hope thou wilt
not take ill, for I can[deletion]not[/deletion] honestly say, I would be far from
intentionally giving one, whom I so dearly love & respect, the
least cause of offence. Our last parting has often been brought
to my remembrance since, (& to speak the truth, [deletion]honestly[/deletion] without
a thought of wishing improperly to curry favour) [deletion]&[/deletion] tho'
I felt like a little wounded by an expression thou dropt, yet
I was glad [underline]thou[/underline] felt an openness at all towards me, because
I would rather be reproved by thee than pass quite unnoticed:
I cannot exactly remember thy words [deletion]thou spoke[/deletion] respecting
the new lights, or old lights", but I know it grieved me
to think that thou should suppose [underline]many[/underline] of the present
generation ([underline]who wish to be acceptable[/underline]) were of opinion
that they had found out any [underline]new way[/underline], I trust we
believe in the [underline]same Light[/underline], - but sure, [deletion]by[/deletion] simplyfying
little matters of an outward nature, does not prove
us to [insertion]be[/insertion] climbing up a wrong way: - this thing of outward
clothing was always given to change I believe, the very
plain[insertion]n[/insertion]est friends long ago (I have heard) wore out-of-the-
way things, but then it was accounted plain in those
days. The black-hood was put upon me when a child,
& when I saw it dropping away from several I also
longed to get shut of it, - did I believe the warmth
of it necessary (as very likely it may be to elderly
people) I [deletion]believe[/deletion] [insertion]think [/insertion] I would [insertion]not have[/insertion] put it away for [underline]fashion[/underline]-sake
I settled it [deletion]so[/deletion] [insertion][underline]thus[/underline][/insertion], that if my mother spoke to me about
leaving it off, & expressed [insertion]uneasiness[/insertion], I would wear it, but
if not that I would not: so as she did [underline]not[/underline] I have
continued these four years back without it: I fear if

if I put it on now I should appear very whimsical,
nevertheless if [underline]thou desires[/underline] me I believe I shall:
I hope what thou chiefly dislikes is sitting without
my bonnet, the white cap appearing childish, if this
be all, I may wear my bonnet, which in winter
is comfortable. I desire thy excuse in taking up
thy time about a matter of so little moment, when
very likely thy mind may be engaged about things
of great [deletion]weight[/deletion] [insertion]consequence[/insertion]. My dear love awaits Jane, &
also thy daughter. I am dear friend, with
grateful affection, thy unworthy S.S.
