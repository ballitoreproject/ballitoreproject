30 Aungier Street 1 of 4 Month - 1819
My dear friend
I received, since I last wrote to thee
thy two letters, dated the 14th of 24th of 3d. month respectively,
the first enclosing a letter for John Cummings, which I left
for him at his shop with the Camparpes - I delivered
thy message for Joseph Humphreys to Mary Chandlee, who
will take care of it. Thou mentions in one of thy letters
a parcel for Sarah Meddlicott which thou was wish[/unclear]
to send to Ellen Grubb. I was speaking to her of  it. I
she said she had heard nothing of it- please to explain.
Success to your. new plans for the improvement of the
poor in your neighbourhood, as originating from & sanctioned
by so many practical heads among you, they can
hardly fail. - I have not since seen George Downes
& if I had, I should not have felt myself sufficiently
acquainted with him, to ask him for his poem -- I was
speaking to James Henry about it, who laughs at it - but
I am inclined to think undeservedly -- We the Literary &

Scientific Society of Dublin [underline]do[/underline] pressure the productions of
our [underline] learned[/underline]& [underline]allustrious[/underline] members, but what fate they
will share, it is hard to say - A hundred years hence
[insertion]if they are not not[insertion]been[/insertion] destroyed before that [/insertion] they may have the [underline]extrinsic[/underline] value which [underline]all[/underline] antiquities
possess, on the single ground of being ancient, & they may
also be of [underline]advantage[/underline] by showing the errors into which young
heads may fale, & [deletion]may afford[/deletion]
"but very gentle readers, yet unborn
by whom I need must appear better things,
Since Heaven would now grow weary of a world
Productive only if a saw like ours,"
may have also the [underline]pleasure[/underline] of laughing at our fancy efforts.
I left thy letter for Hannah Lefam at her father's, [deletion]house[/deletion]
they [unclear][/unclear] read within, or I should have gone up to see
her. -- Tell Mary Shackleton, that I [underline]did[/underline] received E A
essay safe, & that I told Eliza Gough about Pectalozzi. -
Jacob Harvey lately inclosed now a letter for thee,
which I sent by his cousins the Harveys; - I have since received
one from him myself, which I intend to take with
me when I go [insertion]to[/insertion] see you next week, & show it to thee,
& I shall expect a like privilege in return - I was at
the Deaf & blind school the other day where I saw Stephen

He says the society have not yet got a house, but he
thinks they will very soon. He was as kind as to lend
me a long letter which he got from Joseph Humphreys,
which however, does such contain much news. It was written
which however, does not contain much news. It was written
from Joshua Harvey's rooms who was reading hard for
a diploma which he expect to obtain in the 8th month
after which Susanna Todhunter informs me. He is to visit
the Continents - I received from thee Melennia's paper, 
[unclear][/unclear]I I have not yet inserted in any of the papers [deletion][/deletion]
[deletion][/deletion] doubtful of the utility of of[deletion]Assisting[/deletion] [insertion]publishing[/insertion] [deletion]investing[/deletion] it [deletion]at[/deletion]
that the bill has been rejected by the Town [unclear][/unclear]
Lords - perhaps I am wrong in this conclusion
but Mary Chandlee being of the same opinion, confirmed
me in this measure; however, as I suppose [deletion]it[/deletion] a few
days delay will be of no consequence. I can defer it, until
I see thee next week. & we can talk over it - -
I suppose my brother James, Thomas Gordon & T.H. Fodan
enjoying themselves among you. I will go as soon
as I can. Wish love to all
I remain thine affectionately
Thomas Fisher
