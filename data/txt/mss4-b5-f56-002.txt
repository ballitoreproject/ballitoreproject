No. 5 South Mall Cork. June the 14th [underline]1825[/underline].
Dear Mrs. Leadbeater.
For these fine days past I have been in doubt, whether
I might take the Liberty of adressing you a few lines or not, on the Subject relating
to my being able to get a Situation in the Kildare Street Education Society.
At the time I spoke to you about it I read in hopes that before three
weeks should have passed I would again be on my way to Dublin,
See you in passing, & afterward call on Mr. Bewly; Circumstances,
however, induce me to think that I have yet an indefinate period to remain
here, which you will perceive on my informing you of what is my object
in remaining. -[underline] Between you & I[/underline], my dear Friend, I came down here
to endeavour to gain the heart & hand of one of my own but distant
relations; a person of very superior talents in painting; but equally good
& religious - from the reception I have met with in I am in hopes of success,
but yesterday Evening I heard some allusions to the Smallness of our
Incomes, which, coupled with [insertion]the [/insertion]opposition which I am sure to meet from her
family, they being all [underline][underline]well [/underline]married[/underline], at least were so at first; I fear my hopes
may not be well founded. I am really very much distressed for my attachment

to the young Lady, altho' perhaps unknown to her, began [underline]Eleven [/underline]years ago, but
then her father was living, & I thought her sick & destined for a higher & "more
eligible an alliance that that of a Sailor. - In my distress, my only relief
for the moment, is in pening you, my dear friend, these few lines, confiding in
your discretion, & interest in my welfare: I do it to ask you, if you [underline]think[/underline],
from Mr. Bewly's answer to the Letter you were so kind as to write to him in my
favour, I may hope to get a situation, if the opportunity presents itself, in
the Education Society, or indeed[underline] any[/underline] respectable situation he might have at
his disposal. I detest the idea of retuning to Sea, & particularly so, for
the purpose of making money; indeed hardly any consideration would induce
me to return to so hateful a life. I might succeed in getting something
ashore, but then I need friends, of which I have many, but whose
friendship I fear to put to the Test; having on more than [insertion]on [/insertion]one occasion
perceived that it existed but in name among my own; this
I mention to [underline]you [/underline]to account for my troubling you on this occasion, instead
of going to those whose Aid & Interest I might & ought to expect.
Believe me, my dear Mrs. Leadbater, whatever trouble you may put yourself to
on my account, [insertion]it[/insertion] shall in no [unclear]wide [/unclear]be bestowed unworthily, & be well assured
whether it shall be crowned with success or not, I shall be very sincerely thankful
to you for it. I am sincerely sorry for the trespassing on your kindness for me;
but alas! I felt, my only pope for ultimate success to establish myself happily
in this life, dipends, next to the Almighty, on some such friend as you, who
on knowing me, would be induced to have my welfare at heart. Should an
occasion present itself to Mr. Bewly; or any other friend; to give me a situation

of truth & confidence, believe me I will do my utmost to fulfill if [underline]faithfully[/underline],
& perhaps to a degree which would give full satisfaction. I would
give the world to have a respectable occupation on Shore, as in that
case I would be in a way to mentain comfortably & happily a
family if ever I should be blessed with one, besides occupying
a mind [underline]disposed [/underline]to roam. My warmest prayer to Heaven is to
obtain success, & that it may be so, I am sure, my dear friend, will
be one of your most sincere wishes.
I cannot tell you how very
[deletion]much [/deletion]kind & attentive Joshua
Bale & family have been to
me; I highly esteem & admire him-
he seems to be such a fine, good
and honest man; highly informed, & equally capable
of condescending [insertion]to [/insertion]& conversing amiably with men of low degrees. -
I am infinitely obliged to my good friend Sally for so kind & good
an introduction to such a worthy character. He has a[underline] very fine[/underline]
& healthy child, rather a young but most amiable wife; altogether
happy as happy can be. How I envy such a State!! -
When you shall be at leasure, my dear Mrs. Leadbater, may I hope for
a line from you, [underline]directed to the Post Office[/underline]; & should Mr. Bewly have a
vacancy among his select few, & be inclined to bestow it upon me on
[underline]your account[/underline], [underline]a line[/underline] directed to the same place would bring me up
to Dublin by the mail. Until I hear from you, I shall not put the

[unclear]Lucttion [/unclear]which will de[deletion]s[/deletion]cide on my future happiness or the contrary for
a length of time. With best regards to Mr. Leadbater & all your family,
whom I hope are well & happy, & also yourself, my dear friend,
I remain your affectionate & old friend
& acquaintance
Jas. N. Graydon.
