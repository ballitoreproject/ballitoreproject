Dr. Ms.
I must after my old fashion
of beggin forgiveness but I hope
this wilt mitigate my punishment
a little when I tell thee
that I wrote the Dialogue almost
& I lost it and was obliged
to write this one & think
that it is done better than the other
was
Please to beg Peggy to
excuse me for not coming &
tell her that I have not time
but when my uncle comes home
I will go.
We eat our supper at daylight
to night for the first time
this year
I am &c

Dialogue 5.
Xanthus & the Sea
X. O sea receive me suffering
dreadful thing extinguish my
wounds. S. [deletion]What ???? [/deletion] What ails
thee O Xanthus who hath burned
thee so. X. Vulcan - But miserable
I am almost reduced to a
coal & grow hot. S. But for what
reason did he throw the fire on thee
X. Because of the son of Thetis for
after I had suppliantly begged
him killing the Trojans but he woud
not desist from his anger but was
strewing my channel with dead carcases
then I pitying their misfortunes
fell upon him & willing to overwhelm
him with my waves that being affrighted
he might desist from the men.
There Vulcan (being some where near) bringing
all his fire as much I suppose as he had
& as much as there is in & not any where
else fell upon me burning my Sons &
myrtles but he roasted my poor fishes
& eels. Making me to bubble with a great
noise he was not far from making me all
dry Dost thou see how sore I am with the
burnt blisters. S. Thou art troubled,
hot O Xanthus as any one would be for
the blood from the carcases but the heat
as thou sayest from the fire & deservedly
O Xanthus this haste fallen thee
that attacked my son not fearing
that he was the son of a Nereid X.
Ought not I pity my neighbours
the Trojans. S. Ought not Vulcan
to pity Achilles who was the son
of Thetis.
