My dear Mrs Leadbeater
I am truly sorry for the disappointment
of your benevolent plans with respect to the adult
school, - but I hope the mild & judicious remonstrance
of its patrons may yet gain upon the prejudices of
the priest. Mr Smith desires me to say, that if
Mr Shackleton will send him the papers he [unclear]was[/unclear]
to have presented to the Society of Arts, he will
take care that they are attended to -. [deletion]I will send[/deletion]
if they weigh more than an ounce, have the goodness
to enclose them in different covers - I sincerely hope
Catherine will succeed in her trade, my mite has
been there I am sure well bestowed. Your kind
interest about our family circle is very grateful
to me. [deletion]Joanna[/deletion] The same Joanna who used in her
infantine days to be so great a favorite with good

Mr Wilkinson was married [deletion]last[/deletion] in 1817 [deletion][/deletion] to
John Carter, the member for Portsmouth. she has
now a little boy - She is indeed most happily
settled, we had known her husband ever since
he was a boy at school & had always looked upon
him as possessing very great merit - & [deletion][/deletion] the
year he has been united to our dear daughter
has greatly added to the high opinion we before
entertained of him â€” Pray continue to
let me hear from you as often as it is convenient
[unclear]to you[/unclear] to write, for I am greatly interested in
the history of Ballitore & it inhabitants, & find
much pleasure in following you in your benevolent
exertions - Believe me, my dear friend
Most sincerely yours
Frances Smith
