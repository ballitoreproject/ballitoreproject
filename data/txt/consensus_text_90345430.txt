photograps now exhibited in Abbey street
and were very much pleased and
interested with them. Balaclava
is a much larger town than I had
imagined, but cannot boast of fine
houses, it is picturesquly situated
being surrounded apparently by high
hills and close to the winding
pretty little harbour which is certainly
well stocked with vessels. In all
the views one cannot help remarking
the almost total absence of trees, indeed
I only recollect seeing one solitary
forlorn looking specimen, and that was
near Balaclava.
Margt and I took tea at Johns
leaving Charlie to fight out a game
of chess with an antagonist whom he
had challenged.
4 Tuesday. Philip came to town to day
and we went shopping together and
then to hear a lecture on Physical geography
delivered by Jukes at the Dublin Society Ho[unclear][/unclear]
which was very interesting and instructive
