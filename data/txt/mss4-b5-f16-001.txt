Gladly would I say something to my sweet Cousin Molly
in return for her agreeable letter but am afraid I
have nothing to offer worth thy perusal - my Cousins
are before-hand with me - they have sent thee all
the [insertion]news[/insertion] this Villa afford I doubt not -
It was very satisfactory to find that you got safe to
Clonmel & that thy dear Mother was bravely I hope
the Excursion will be of service to her health
I suppose Cousin Peggy is very busy setting her [unclear]home[/unclear]
besure to get [deletion]all[/deletion] [insertion]every[/insertion] thing in great order against thy
Father's arrival he intends to be with you in about
ten days - we shall be rather lonesome without him
& shall miss him greatly both day & night I almost
begrudge your Company to our friends at Clonmel none
my time here seeming so short - but I ought not
to be too selfish - I hope we may meet again

I cannot think of our separation without being [underline]sensibly affected[/underline]
by it - tho' I endeavor to put the day/ evil I will not
can-not call it/ afar off - yet in all probability it
will soon be here - We shall expect our friends
from England in about two weeks Morris intends to
meet them in Dublin if all be well - He desires
his dear love to thee -
Billy Collis is just come in - Ben Wills &
Frank Johnson are come to Town also
When [underline]they[/underline] have sent [underline]all[/underline] & she [underline]more[/underline] what can be left for him to
add, - my Cousin Mary may query - If I have no Letter to answer nor apology
to make (for want of something to offer worthy notice &c) I may at least ask
thy excuse for thus intruding with what will be little better than Nothing, but
Sally would have it so; she partial to her Friend, finding her Pen at fault,
as she pretends (but I cannot altogether take it in) thought the blank space would certainly
be small filled if I did that take in hand- - what could I say & can I refuse
her [deletion]anything[/deletion]? - or thee, hadst thou [deletion]but[/deletion] written to me at all, to be sure I could not,
but so many here, [unclear][/unclear] almost every relation, have a prior right to thy farms
that, however bountifully disposed, I could not reasonably expect to [unclear]have[/unclear] take of the
first Fruits of the enlivening Air of [unclear]renewal[/unclear], unless at second hand, thus let me
assure thee they were very acceptable, such as I got a taste of; but James Maconaughty
has not favoured is even with a [unclear]ight[/unclear] of his yet, Nanny [unclear][/unclear] are much pleased with
thy remembrance of them, & intend make their grateful returns- if they sort what art
Night, & why not as well as the rest of us, [deletion]my friend[/deletion] [insertion]I wonder[/insertion] what account he will give of [unclear][/unclear]
the time of its [unclear]Immertion[/unclear], [unclear]Emartion[/unclear], [unclear]that Digito[/unclear] eclipsed, [unclear][/unclear], & what affinity it has
with a [unclear]Millstone[/unclear]- but hold- I meant not to anticipate- neither to play in the least
on the [unclear][/unclear] good Man, for I respect him much as for me, my [unclear]Curiosity[/unclear] held out too
[unclear][/unclear], & I thought the terms not [unclear][/unclear], [unclear]Aby & Bob[/unclear] staid also, but thy Father & [unclear]the hopes[/unclear]
left us early, the [unclear]interposition[/unclear] of a Cloud discouraged them I believe- poor John the Cook
said "it was covered by the Hand of God," a wise remark indeed. - Please to give our [underline]united[/underline]
Love to thy worthy Mother; thou mayst inform her that a certain [unclear]Fumerous[/unclear] family, not

far from Ballitore, have been quarrelling & fighting with their Neighbours
at such a rate & otherwise behaved amiss, that since you went away, it has
been judg'd proper to deprive them of all their effects, which indeed were
not large, & turn them one & all out of House & Harbour; since when
an attempt has been made by some of the same Crew, or no better,
to get into your House by creeping in at the Hall Chimney, but
being discovered, before they got quite down, a watch has since been
set in hope of taking them in the fact, tho' hitherto in vain;
otherwise Things go on pretty well I think, considering. Our
love is also to the happy Pair & their Connections, with any
enquiring Friends - & believe me thy very affectionate Frd
* 'tis suspected several have lost
their lives. -
Only the Bees have been quarrelling - that is all -
