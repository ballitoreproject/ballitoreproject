Ballitore: 6th month 1760.

Dear friend,

	+++ I find by a letter written by my father that this was the most comfortable meeting he was ever at in London. I like much to hear of that meeting being favoured, because that ^no^ meeting so properly represents the state of the Society (I believe ^think^) all the world over, & indeed the advices sent from thence seem to demonstrate that the living members of that meeting have been [word crossed out] ^truly^ baptized into the state of the society.
	I have been thinking sometimes that if that young woman J.C. got with thee at times to Province Meetings, & had the opportunity of the unmixed company & conversation of select friends, it might be of service to her in giving her a relish & savour for the innocence, lowliness & simplicity of the cross, & engage her more to expose herself in listing under the ^its^ banner; for by the choice we make of our company we testify & avow (as it were) to the world what manner of life we are inclined to; & as soon as we run counter to the worlds manners then the cross begins to be felt, & in keeping to this is our safety & there is none from under it. May the enemy of all good & of our only true, substantial happiness be defeated in her & in all of us! +++
	Farewell
		Richard Shackleton
