My dear Elizth
Eben brought me the two little beauties
for which I am much obliged, Margt &
I are at the Glen these 10 days past
I think Margt much improved by the
fresh air & I am also refresh'd &
rested myself I thought bad of leaving
T White but she did not wish me to
put off my coming out on her account
& I did not wish to defer Margt's visit
lest she should suffer for the want of it
I was sorry & surprized to hear of Joseph
Henry's death as we thought he
was over the worst & that he [unclear]m[/unclear]
rub thro', dear H Pim is no better
I had a letter from Lydia all within
are well as usual long may they be so
Willy has got two teeth is Fanny talking
of moving Margt is talking of going
to America so if she does she need
not go further south I have done
nought as yet about thy Margt tho'
I am much inclined for her & hope
to have come or settled on before
the [underline]event[/underline] takes place I have had
no opportunity of consulting Edw

since [deletion]I believe[/deletion] I have many jobs to
do which hang heavily on me
but I hope to get thru them
by degrees if I had thee near
me thou would a fine help
be ever thy NB
Elizabeth Leadbeater
