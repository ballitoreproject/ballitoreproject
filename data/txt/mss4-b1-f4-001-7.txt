R. T. to his Daughter Deborah.
Clonmel, 8th of Ninth month 1780.
*** I am pleased thou has got one step towards thy
solemn engagement, I hope, well over. The benediction of our good old
154
friend Robert Lecky was grateful to me also, as well as to thee.
I hope you will often both severally and unitedly, seek for the immediate
descending of that blessing which maketh truly rich & adds
no sorrow with it. The riches of this world, accumulated even
by honest industry, without having the great Disposer of all things
in view, and acting about the affairs of this life in His holy fear, are
often the means of inexpressible perplexity and disquiet, sometimes
of the most dreadful evils. Whereas, a looking, a leaning, a humble
dependance on Him that feeds the ravens, and in the concatination
of events ordered by his providence, caused the same ravens to feed
his Prophet, is the way to procure the divine blessing to be superadded,
and prevents that sorrow which worketh death to the innocent,
happy, composed life. But though I thus indulge a freedom in writing,
I think I well know both your hearts, and that they are in that place
