Waterford 8th 2nd month 1783


Dear Uncle,


        I had the pleasure of receiving thine of the 23rd ultimo with the agreeable account of the health of my Friends, which I hope may long continue. It will be no small gratification to me, when I can be indulged with a view, so long & so ardently wished for, as your delightful fire-side, to which I hope there will be no obstruction in the course of three or four months. Soon after thou wrote to me I suppose thou heard of Mary Watsons introducing into the world her daughter Jane: I am sorry to have it to say that they do not entertain much hopes of the childs living long. Mary Strangman is still in a very poor weak state. A few days since I heard T: Fayle communicating to A Balfour part of a Letter he received from Samuel Neale which as I thought it might be acceptable to thee I took a copy of  After mentioning that he had a Letter from John Pemberton from New York he proceeds thusHe waits for a Passage not being willing to come over in a Prize Ship or a Vessel carrying guns: he says within a few months several that were enemies to Truth & Friends are laid hold of by a superiour [sic] power, and some very unexpected, some of talents & parts are become advocates for the Testimony they before trampled under foot & several have appeared acceptably in Meetings in the humility & meekness A Balfour desired I might inform thee that he had received thy letter, he gets his health as usual; but his wife has been very poorly of late.
        Pray give my love to all at home & believe me
                Dear Uncle,        very affectionately thine
                        William Rayner
