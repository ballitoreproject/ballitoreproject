3rd.. - We went to meeting
this morning after
which we went to Aunt
Coles' to get a book from
the library, and then
to the dentists in
Merrion St. where they
have moved, to get
two of my teeth stopped
after that delightful
operation was over
we parted, Margt. went
home in a covered car,
and Josephine and
I called at Dr Gordon's
found Mrs G out, but
the doctor seeing us
just we were going
away, asked us to
walk in, as he wanted
