It was pleasant, my dear sister, to see thy
last dated from Clogheen, because [underline]I[/underline] was not likely to
have had any more of thee, & expecting thou had finished
thy work, the reflection of thy being now enjoying
thy own comfortable-fire-side, while the snow is flying
about, & the frost pinching the feet of the poor traveller
was chee[insertion]r[/insertion]ing to me as I step'd out of bed this morning;
thou sees I did not begin the day badly: - indeed thou
often, & dear brother Saml. too, present to my mind
with great sweetness, I have no doubt of your sympathy,
with great sweetness; I have no doubt of your sympathy,
& I am glad I have it: - I could pour out my
heart a little but perhaps had better be quiet: - to be
sure I cannot describe my feelings one meetg. day since
I came home when I thought I felt the gentle, sweet
touches of good within me, intimating that I should
utter a few words, & while I strove to get to a little
certainty & calmness, it rushed into my mind, that
certainty & calmness, it rushed into my mind, - that
I was desired to be silent by the Elders: - I struggled
the remainder of the meetg. thro', & returned home
weak in body, & distressed in mind: I just tell [underline]thee[/underline],
this, which thou may guess at my situation from.

I pity my dear friend Mary Dudley to have such repeated
sickness in her family: I also feel much for Sally
Grubb, I am sure it is a great trial to the lively, pleasant
creature to be obliged to lie there in her bed, & a loss
to all the up-folk who should be gratified with her desirable
company. I hope thou wert not much inconvenienced
by taking the quilts, I think they have a better
chance of going from you than us: - I hope thou wilt
kindly have them in thought if any way turns up, -
could they go by some free safe mode to Mary Harvey,
Chipley, Cork, & a line with them begging she would forward?
[underline]I know[/underline] she is one of those who has a pleasure
in serving her friends: - I wrote Becky Harvey of thy
having them. Yesterday sister Chandlee dined & spent
the day with us, to our mutual satisfaction I expect:
Brother extreamly weak & poorly, - Mary much with
her father & mother I believe, & I expect will take
plain work to do, & Betsy is teaching her to make
gowns: thus I hope the poor child will be able to get
to be a little independant: her mother seems to enjoy
having her. - I am answering thy queries as they are
spread before me on the table: - my poor eyes come
next, & really they are bad enough but, warmth comforts

comforts them: I had threatening of the colick yesterday,
but it went off to my great satisfaction, & if [underline]I [/underline]might
so say, I was thankful (I think) therefor, as I dread it.
Sister Lydia is a delicate creature, has been, & is just now
in the drooping way, however she sends love to thee, as
do Mary & Margt., all who are at home at present:
Betsy stays with her sister Lydia till she gets a person
(she is expecting) to help her about house & child: - the
sweet little creature & her amiable mother seem finely.
The young-woman at John Thomas's seems gradually
declining, her mother is just now visiting her.
brother Saml., I suppose he could not.
it convenient to give us a call, wch.
have been [underline]truly[/underline] pleasant to us.
Now, my dear sister, farewell, mayest thou have
every comfort thou wishes for says the heart
of thy sincerely affectionate sister.
Griece-bank:
16/2 mo: 1810.
I would like to be remembered to all your family
&c:, Margt., Saml., Robert & Thos. - also the servants, - does
poor Molly keep singing? Remember me to Jenny & Phebe
Taylor, & besure to Sally Averal, who I hope gets a good
dish of tea & warming with you, as usual.
S: Shackleton.

Dost thou remember the little memorandum I gave
thee respecting [deletion]Dud[/deletion] Judy Malone? - She is really deserving
the help of her relatives: - I hear her covering at night
is very miserable, & we see her day covering is not much
better: we frequently do [underline]little[/underline] matters in this way, - but
this seems rather [underline]big[/underline], as we have another biggish thing
just now in hands.
