My dear Cousin,

	++++ I congratulate the new-married pair x on their union - I hope there is cause to hope that he who made them has mercifully condescended to interfere in their connexion - that it is not without his Divine notice & approbation - They are young, it is the Spring-time of life with them - luxuriant shoots will be apt to grow - may they suffer the pruning hand of Divine culture, the baptism which initiates & preserves & keeps clean, & renders comely & acceptable in the sight of the husband of souls - Acceptance with him is all - & without it every enjoyment fails of satisfying the immortal spirit - every comfort of this life loses its ^best^ relish, & every trouble is aggravated by an additional sting - Whereas, dwelling low, keeping in the moderation, and looking to our great Benefactor daily for his blessing, holding All as at his hand, & referring All to him, his benefits are received with humble thankfulness, he fillith our hearts with food & gladness, the creatures are used to his honour, & not abused to our hurt, & the Great Giver has the praise of all. Give my dear love to them both - as they are now one flesh, I hope they will be of one spirit, & that a right one - There does not seem to hang a doubt about me but that they will do well every way.

So be it +++ [line taped or covered over]
very affectionately thine Richard Shackleton
