Ballitore 3rd. of 5 mo: 1825
To Edward Maguire
I am much obliged by thy communication
which I recd. to day - The widow Richardson, who is
Counsellor Wills's sister, took refuge in the widow Ricky's
house in Athy after her husband's sudden death, &
Cou[insertion]n[/insertion]sellor Wills being there for the purpose of bringing
his sister & her children to Dublin to live with him -
the widow Ricky took the opportunity [insertion]of [/insertion]enlisting
him in her behalf, & Anthony Wills accordingly
wrote to me, begging that I wd. distrain her tenants
on the premes & to be as tender of her as I possibly
could - I answered him by saying that I was
disposed to act with as little harshness towards
her as circumstances would admit, & that I expected
to see her shortly & converse on the subject - so
that I am willing to wait till I hear what she
proposes on the subject of the rent due to me -
I recd. a letter the morning after I came home from
Henry

Henry Mc.Manus, which I inclose for thy perusal, &
I will copy my answer underneath - I have not
seen or heard from Richd. Grattan - I would not
build much upon what he wd. say, however I wd. be
very glad he wd. settle it without Law -
thy obliged frd.

To Henry McManus
I do not think that my conduct
towards thee, respecting my rent, for these many years back
deserved such a letter as I recd. from thee this morning -
All that seems necessary for me to communicate to thee
now, is, that I have left my Rect. for what rent was due to
me the 25th.. March last, with my Attory, Edwd. Maguire
No. 4 Eustace Street, which I expect thou will [underline]condescend[/underline]
to pay - & I may also add, that for the future I will expect
my rent to be paid regularly, every half year, as it becomes
due -
William Leadbeater

3d May 1825

respecting Mrs Ricky - Mr
McManus & Mr Grattan.
