Ballitore 8th of 12th month 1822
The letter which I received from thee the other morning
my dear Sarah gave me much pleasure I could
not in comfort reply to it until today - It is
not because first day is a day of repose & quietness
that I prefer it for writing letters - but because on
that day only my needle has legitimate leave to
lie idle - indeed I find that I must on every other
day keep it unceasingly busy to needle my mountains
of work through & through - my habit is not yet finished
but I do not despair of completing it without
spoiling, I wish thou would get the bill of it from
J Wright & send it to me.
I often very often think of the time I spent with
thee my dear Sarah & it seems to me that if I
had it to give again I would not bestow so much
of it on others - Of Edward I may say I saw nothing
he or I were so constantly engaged - Oh! when I think
that for the future my visits must be transient
both to thee & to this home that [unclear]seem[/unclear] & feel dearer
to me than ever, It requires all the recollection of
the worth of the person for whose sake the sacrifice
is to be made & the often keenly felt pain of separation;
to make me bear the idea with patience
or think that I shall be the happier for it. And
some day to Carlow stay the next & come home the 3rd
All this [underline]postscriptum[/underline] is clear gain to thee as we never
section a letter longer than "thy affectionate". - Doyle
has brought home his wife - our Mary stood for a child
to day - Our Biddy is gone out, some say to be
married - Ellen Clarke the Royal Veteran's lady
is dead - The Captain wished to have her buried
with military honours & wrote to the Peelers here &
Where to be ready & to fire over her - but it was
not done & the only thing he can now do is to get a
tomb stone from Carlow & bid it lett with more [unclear]truth[/unclear]
I believe that they often do, of her virtue & the Capts grief
He is almost inconsolable I hear - So much for Village
news. Again farewell - Don't say "thankee for nothing
as did the [underline]Gallipot[/underline]" when thou reads this epistle - but
write to me as soon as thou can with ease & pleasure to
thyself. I must have done. The pack from the North
not come. Love to Debby Johnson when thou
sees her.

again when I think that I must move among strangers
who will not be willing to make excuses for me
as you have ever done I dread the giddiness of my
disposition & fear that I shall not be what every wife
should the honour & glory of her husband. But I did
not think to say so much of myself & I should tell
thee that Joseph Fisher is a great deal better - he
was much worse than I had any idea of I understand,
from my father - I am obliged that it was
concealed from me for it would only have made
me uneasy without any use - my father tells me
he was not expected to recover - James did not
say so much - but he said enough to show that
they were all seriously alarmed - he is now however
recovering but George has not obtained leave yet
to trouble his repose by showing himself as [insertion]the[/insertion] beguiler
of his precious Hannah.
Dont ever think of my misadventure in the streets again
lest it should bring to thy mind my ill-temper & of
that I would wish thee never to think of or any of
my faults - thou wert not unkind to me - thou never
was & thou had often much to bear from me - but
let all be forgotten & nothing thought of but when we
shall meet again & how often for the future we
shall see each other - Oh! how ardently I wish we
were to live in Dublin - but this is foolish.
I have the verse on the Queen & shall send it by first
opportunity along with thy towel & other things - if
I had known that Richd would not have ridden to
town I would have sent them by him.
Hannah Boake is extremely ill & that [underline]tonsonolic[/underline] the
Doctor is to be called in Tom says - it is comical
enough to leave it until tomorrow - perhaps because
this is first day - but surely we may do good in the Sabbath.
Little Eizth White put the catkin of a hazel up her nostril
but the Doctor says it is of no consequence & that it will
come home via the palate or swallow rather - I thought
of Erasmus Percy & the bit of green silk in Patronage
Eben's bile fit is over he lay one day (5th) partly in bed
& said the weather was cold that he was not ill but
that he would now follow the plan of Sam Jacobs
wife of Clonmel & try how he would take it - however
he did not pursue it long & he is now well.
My father returned 6th day night in the coach well
& hearty. I am obliged to Eliza for sending the
things to M. Humphries - Remember me to her &
to Dick Finto & Glorious John - have you yet
got the "Fortunes of Nigel"? we read nothing here
Bracebridge Hall is finished. - Eben Debs & I are to go

I will also send the shoes for Arthur give my love to
[deletion]her & to[/deletion] thy father & mother - I cannot forget their
kindness & affection to me. Here follows the bill
4 stone seconds 6 '' 9
1 E oatmeal - 12 '' -
shillgs 12 ,, 9
E. & G. S. want the bill of the
[deletion]of the[/deletion] candles they got some
time ago.
Deborah is finely and spent part of the day here - she
returned home to tea as Eben had a slight attack of
bile but thou may think not very bad as he was able
to ride to Kilcullen & back again yesterday. D left her
love for thee. I would thank thee to enquire
from Sally Barrington about the bombazine for Mary
White & to send it as soon as she can conveniently.
I am ashamed at my delaying getting it when [unclear][/unclear]
also if thou would go [insertion]to[/insertion] the ware shop once [unclear]Linfd get finish [/unclear]
get the two tea cups which I paid [underline]5[/underline] [unclear][/unclear]
as Elizth is not pleased about them
I hate her little commissions; they
the same of our common ones.
There has been no letter from Thomas Fisher since
Dublin either here or in Limerick - I hope he is
merry England" but it would be very pleasant to
Hope for Certainty. - Richard has been he[unclear][/unclear]
to me & I am sitting in Mary Doyle's Kitchen as it is
first day & she is out until it is now too late
to say much more as it is near post hour. Many
a pleasant [underline]shanach[/underline] we had here in days gone by
the good [underline]ould[/underline] times - & dost thou remember the winter
before last when we were [underline]authors[/underline] to the Ballitore magazine
pulling out crumpled bits of paper & reading & writing
in comers & claiming one writer [unclear][/unclear] critiscism - Oh
then those were pleasant times though they had their
bitters too. -- I hope you will come at Christmas
I did ask John to come but if his coming would hinder
yours both you & he know that you would be by far the
most welcome guests. - I hope he can at some time visit
Ballitore before I leave it as I would rejoice - in paying
both him & Richard some attention for all their kindness
& [underline]devotion [/underline]to me & my pleasure - My mothers dear
love.
my aunt Lydia was very poorly she is something better Lydia
better. Richard left a queer pair of howsers with you
I think he says in the shoe room - my pens are so bad
I can scarcely write - I suppose thou hast seen Betsy
We expect her home early this week
If Jane Cooper goes as she intended next fourth day I
will send the things by her but I hear to day that
mine most cordially to Edward & thyself
Ever thy affectionate

[underline]For Sarah[/underline]
