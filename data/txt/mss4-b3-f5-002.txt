Dear Cousins/

Several vessels from this Port are for sailing shortly, probably some of them may touch at Dublin or Cork  I am unwilling to miss so likely an opportunity of conveying a few lines to you my dear Cousins tho conscious of their unworthiness yet I trust affection for the writer will render them acceptable in this hope I will proceed.
	I doubt not but you have had the affecting account of the removal of dear William Hunt  Cousin M Birkbeck thinks he caught the Infection at Amsterdam, they had a very rough passage in their return  William was indisposed, they imagined from cold on ship board but in a few days after their arrival at Newcastle the small pox appeared which put a period to his time here on the tenth day the 9th ultimate instant. Cousin Morris attended him mostly night and day, he was sensible to the last desired that he would write to his Wife & Children & tell them  all was well, his affliction of Body was great but his mind was above it all  he also desired his dear love to all his Friends and to my poor Tommy  do thou Morris comfort him 
	Thomas was at a Friends House not far distant his attendance would have been imprudent  his situation how distressing  He attended the Meeting, the corpse was interred before  he had an opportunity from the back windows of his lodgings of seeing the last office performed for his dear Uncle 
	A few days before, Cousin Morris received an alarming account of his Father Birkbecks situation, he was seized with a Nervous Fever, not likely to recover or continue long  he hastened from one mournful scene to another  after the funeral on sixth day he set out & reached Settle the next day, his Father had been for several days mostly delirious had asked for him that day & knew him perfectly but soon lost himself again  he continued til the third day  I had an Invitation and attended the funeral last sixth day but one the 18th ultimate that day week that dear William Hunt was buried  I found Cousin Morris much better than I expected from his late watching attendance, and anxiety  he seems to bear with great fortitude this last great Tryal  his Father will much missed, he was a Man greatly concerned and truly zealous for the promotion of good order in the church and the great cause of Truth
	The loss of such is really affecting even to some that seem at times to have little sense of feeling left
	Sarah & Deborah Morris & Thomas Thornburgh were expected at Settle last seventh day, from York they propose being at Kendal quarterly meeting next sixth day and at this the fourth day following.
	I have not seen Margaret Hartley since her return from Ireland  poor Woman  her Son her only Son a hopeful young Man, married & just settled in business was taken away in her absence, pretty suddenly, a fit of the cholick, & believe, they did not inform her  she knew it not til she reached Settle  Cousin Bradfords desire their dear love, Cousin John still continued weak & feeble in body, he is now confined to his room, not likely to get much out of it again it is surprising to all that know him that he has continued thus long
	We are glad to hear of Samuel Neales safe return if he has brought any account of my Brother please to let me know 
	My dear love to Cousin D. Carlton, Cousin Debby, Peggy, Aby, Molly & Sally  or any that may enquire  it is long since I had a letter from Ballitore 
to hear of your welfare will be very acceptable to your truly affectionate Kinswoman S. Hall
