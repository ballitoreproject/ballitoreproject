Ballitore: 21st of 1st month 1782.

Dear friend,
	On my return from Carlow I received thine and thy husbands favours of 15thMany confirmations publick and private we have since had of the loss of our dear friendsTheir dissolution was doubtless attended by circumstances of horrour peculiar to a violent deathbut horrour is peculiar to death of every kind, and their pain of body I believe was much less and of shorter duration than generally accompanies a natural death. I think, however there is good ground of hope that their souls are preserved with an everlasting salvation, and that they did not make shipwreck of faith, nor were cast-away from divine favour. Their near friends and relations, survivors, are objects of tender sympathy and compassion. I understand that Anne Sparrow, the mother, is chief mourner, and several are of opinion that grief lays close siege to her lifeYet there is a plaster broad enough for every soreand there is a consolation which can reach to the lowest depths of human misery. May it be the experience of all those who have drank deep of this bitter cup! +++ There was a particular intimacy between Samuel Grubb & his deceased cousin, which causes this to go hard with the formerThus we see trouble is the lot of human nature & no state or condition of life is exempt from it. Happy those who witness that which is ordained for a counterpoise to itinward Peace!
