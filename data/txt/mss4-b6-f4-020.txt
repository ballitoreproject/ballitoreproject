In the Irish channel we had spoken a fast
sailing ship called the Gleaner bound also to
Newyork, & of course it became a contest of speed,
which of us should win the race on the
[underline]3000 mile course[/underline]. - we parted company next
day, & remained in ignorance of her progress
afterwards. When the Pilot came alongside
off Sandy Hook, we called out to him ere he
touched the ship "Has the Gleaner arrived"?
"No Sir" - replied he to our great joy - & added
"When did you leave Belfast?" "On the 20th April
- do we bring the latest news?" "No Sir, the
"Packet from Liverpool of the 24th arrived yesterday
"& the Packet which sailed on the 20th has just
"now gone up." - this intelligence mortified us
a good deal, for we had promised ourselves
the pleasure of having made the very shortest
passage. - however, the green shores of Long
Island, & the Peach orchards on the bay, soon
restored us to our good humour, & we enjoyed
highly the sail upto to the City.-
Upon landing I was struck very much with
the sallow complexions of the people & the
Frenchified dresses of the Ladies - quite as forcibly
as when I first arrived in Newyork - & the

different tone of voice, too, annoyed me a good
deal.- Now, my eyes & ears, both see & hear
thro' a Yankee medium, & I should be just
as much amused in listening to the conversation
of a Dublin crowd, were I to go over again,
as I was last year.- My friends here appeared
glad to see me back again, particularly as I
had safely got away from such a barbarous
country as Ireland appears to be in the eyes
of strangers! The newspapers give such a dreadful
picture of our unfortunate island, we cannot
be surprised that foreigners who have no means
of distinguishing falsehood from truth, should
look upon us as a demi-civilized Nation.-
and are we truly any better, harsh as the terms
may sound to our pride? what savage Indian
could exceed in cruelty the midnight incendiary
or murderer? What Heathen people live in
greater misery & vice than the Whiteboy
population of Munster?- what bigotted fanatics
cause more bloodshed than the Orangemen?
Sometimes I regard poor Ireland as too deeply
involved in wretchedness ever to rise in the
scale again - but these misgivings are removed

when I permit Hope to enter & draw a picture
of the good fortune yet in store for the "island of
Saints".- I depend most upon the active
benevolence & good sense of the English people -
- not the Government, for I have lost my good
opinion of [deletion]their[/deletion] [insertion]its[/insertion] wisdom - or rather I believe
faction has deadened the exertions of the Cabinet
& destroyed the good effects which the intentions
of some of its members would probably have
produced.- I have conversed a good deal
on Irish affairs with Emmet & McNeven, two
of the principal leaders in the Rebellion of "98 -
they have said to me "We only wanted a reform
"in the administration of Irish affairs, & a redress of
"grievances, & could we have seen a prospect of
"effecting those objects in any other way, we never
"would have chosen an insurrection - but we
"saw no end to petitioning - we lost all confidence
"in the promises of the Ministry, & at length we
"became convinced that nothing short of a separation
"from England could materially serve Ireland."
They still retain their warm Irish feelings, & take
an interest in all that passes "at home". Emmet
has attained the highest post in his profession, &
is justly considered as at the head of the Bar

- he unites, as a pleader, a sound discriminating
judgement, with a powerful eloquence & impassioned
manner.- The Chancellor of this State, one of the
first Judges in America, paid his talents a
very high compliment a few years ago - A friend
of his asked him what he thought of Emmet as
a speaker "Why" replied the Chancellor "I can give
"you an idea of my opinion by telling you, that
"when Mr Emmet appears before me in any important
"case, [underline]I tremble for my Path[/underline]."- In private
life he is perfectly amiable - among his family
& friends he has the simplicity of a child - If
he had remained in Ireland he must have
attained to the highest honours. I me[deletion]e[/deletion]t one
of his youngest daughters at the house of a
particular friend a few evenings ago, & was
very much pleased with her - she is very
handsome, well educated & quite unaffected.
What a magical charm this combination creates
in polished society!
After being engaged the
whole morning with the dry details of business,
- buying & selling with "Jews of all religions", or
diving into the mysteries of stocks & Exchange,
imagine how delightful it is to me to devote
