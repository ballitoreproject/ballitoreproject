Selby 7th of 8 mo" 1788
Dear Cousin
Mary Shackleton
It is so long since I received thy kind letter that
I am ashame'd to answer for my neglect, but when I think of thy
good nature it makes me think of, and hope for forgiveness, which
I beg thee to grant me at this time - My Father & Mother is as
well as can be expected at their time of Life, and I hope the same
with your Family; My Sister Jane is in good health and two
Daughters Sarah and Patience, Sarah can run a way and calls
me Unkle as old fashon'd as any one of her age, the youngest
is a fine girl, My sister comes to Meetings and I do not
know but behaves her self as well in the Family as one can
expect & to all others both in the House and abroad we have
no reasons to think but he makes her a good husband, though
not like a young lad, for this reason I think though I may be
[unclear]rory[/unclear], he had a family before and was the Master of his house
and he will so remain, for he his one that his positive -
but I wish sincearly that they may do well
Thou desired me to write if Sally Armitage was going to be
Marryed or not, but I do not hear she is She is well and her
Father, but her Mother departed this Life some time in
spring, my Father whent to see her a day or two before her
death and took his leave of her, a very affecting Time it was
for they had lived above 75 years and never been parted much
She seemed to express a great regard for my Father, said to him
she was going to her long home where she hoped they would meet
again [deletion]my[/deletion] and much more I could say My Father being poorly
& alittle over sets him, desired them who sat by My Unkle &
Sally to take him ought of the Room. My Aunt Armitage
was 77 years Old when she departed this life My Father is
80 in the next Month he his quiat cleaver for his years & gets
out to Meetings on First days & to the Week day meetings but
never goes further then to my Unkle's, My Mother is as well
as can be expected for her Years tho not so Old as my Father
by 14 years She was at

Staines at my Sisters on third day its only a little walk for her
to go out at our own yard end, one of his daughters comes to Selby
to Scool & to our house to dine, but my Father never was
at her house to see her yit, he as seen both her Childer the
Eldist several times, - Selby Friend in general is well
Cousin Stobbart & her daughter is well, but Sally Reader his
not marryed she lives with her Mother, I called in & got Tea
with them on Second day, William Fawcitt I think thou knows
him and his Wife ([insertion]they was[/insertion] Friends) She died some years since but was
living when thou was [insertion]at[/insertion] Selby, he as marryed John Robinson
daughter of Scarborough, John Robinson his dead so her Mother
lives at Selby with him & his Wife, thy Brother will no him better
then thee for it was him that he so at Nottingham & brought
me a few lines from Cousin [insertion]Shackleton[/insertion], - Margt. Estile should have been
Marryed yisterday at York, to Robert Pickering of Malton
but She was uneasey in her mind so went over to Malton to tell
him, it was somthing perticular for just before she went he
had been expressing his mind to a Friend of the same meeting
he belongs, of the uneasyness that he had in his mind. so
they sent in a paper signed by them both to desire Friends
to let it be apiece longer, till they had both more freedom to
proseed this last Month Meeting was held on Third day in stead
of Fifth day for their Marriage to be on Fourth day at York
so to gone home to Malton that Evening at it is only 18 Miles
from York, - My Aunt Shackleton is well I dined with
her on Third day I so Cousin Jane Hartley & her Husband
going from home but had not oppertunity to speak to them,
Cousin Robert Holborn & his Family as left Tadcaster afew
Weeks since they have removed to Sheffeild, for Friends thought
it might answer, & they having adesire to leave Tadcaster
they was so fare from Meetings & their Family growing up
thought it not so well as there was no Frds. in Town nor a
Scool for them but with other Children I hope it will answer
better for them -

They both came to Selby to [unclear]se[/unclear] my Father & Mother before they left
Tadcaster, and Frank met them with his Cousin Elizh. Carbutt
his House keeper, Frank talked of comming over to Ireland
to see you & asked my Father & Mother if I might come over
with him, my Father I think was easy for me to come but
my Mother was not by reason of my Father being so often
poorly, said She would not be left, so I was forsed for to drop
it at present, but hopes at some day to have the pleasure
of seeing you at Ballitore, I often wish we had you ofter
with us then is likly to be the case, it would be agreat pleas[insertion]ure[/insertion]
to me & all our Frds. I may venture to say - I often see Cousin
Frank at Leeds he and his Family was well last Week,
I was at Ackworth Meeting there was a many Friends there,
and Our Friend John Pemberton had some good advise
to give to the Children [unclear]and[/unclear] the Young People which I hope
and wish we may mind [unclear][/unclear] will be for our own good at the
last day when time here [unclear][/unclear] will be no more. I do not hear
that Frank goes to see any body yit, but thinks he will be
married before me, I tell thee this that thou may not be supp[insertion]rised[/insertion]
and think me slow, for I am pretty quiet at present & thinks
I shall for awile, could like to hear of thee or thy Sister
getting marryed, I hope thy sister will excuse me making
so free with her as I never have had the pleasure of seeing
her, but dont doubt but thou as telld her what kind of a Youth
I am, thinks I shall tire thee with reeding but thou may
take this for truth if thou was within 50 Miles of Selby or
thy Sister I would fetch you with pleasure, nay any of your
Family, My Father and Mother desires their best Love to
thee & all Your Family's and I desire mine to be excepted of
the same and believe me to be thy Loving & affectionate
Cousin
