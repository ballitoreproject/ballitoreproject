My dear Elizath
8th mo : 1812
I think thou said it hurt thee to
write & be assured that I would rather
never get a letter from thee than that
it should injure in the least.
I got a very beautiful letter from
Betsy while in Waterford, her travels
were very entertaining especially from
Youghall to Waterford for she scarcely
met with one person who knew a word
of English & I suppose thou art not un-acquainted
with her adventures a Clash-more.
I have just gone my begging rounds
poor George will owe us a great deal
& we will want it badly as we spent all
the money there was on hands buying
blankets &c

Margaret Power just stop'd at the
door & bought a bonnet good news
for trade, Has thou seen Heyden
it is our luck (as the saying is) to have
Oddities for Richard came home & brought
with him two Collegians who are like
Heyden though I believe not so learn'd
one of them is rather handsome & affable
and is a complete [unclear][/unclear] the other very
sallow & tall but not so agreeable as [unclear][/unclear]
[unclear][/unclear] suppose you will be very busy [unclear][/unclear]
the wedding's will thou go to Roberts
I have a sore eye which hinders me
from writing as much as I'l wish
So adieu my dear sister
ever thine
S Leadbeater
I was in Carlow along with my
mother at the monthly meeting
I need not say how much I am longing
for thy return

I've often made this mistake before
So thou must excuse me my eyes are so
bad I cannot write more,
again thine SL
Elizabeth Leadbeater
Clogheen
