Kingstown 4th of 5th mo: 1827
My dear Elizth
Had I known of FM's intention of going
to Ballitore I would have written by him
him to thank thee for thy [underline]too[/underline] numerous
presents ah! why did thou go & buy that
china for me, indeed I am ashamed of all
thou sends to me - I have the bonny little
wrapper by me waiting for an inhabitant
I wish I could get thee out to Kingstown [deletion]suppose[/deletion] [insertion]even[/insertion]
for one week thou would enjoy the quiet
& laziness of our little habitation at least it
seems delightful to me it is so little like
what I have been struggling with these last
5 years but it seems absurd even to wish
for this thou art so bound up to the house
at home this often makes me wish that
& humble in the station of upper servant who
might occasionally set thee at liberty -
I have a great wish to go to Ballitor for a
week or two in the latter end of this month
to see you all after your trials, Rich'd
is wonderful, but has not put his nose
inside our doors since he came Betsy
is very careful of him, I saw M Richdson
at a distance I intend to make out her lodging
if I can & go to see her
thou had some one there who wd be good hummored

did thou hear that the Stephens's had changed
their residence they are now settled near
the [unclear]Park[/unclear] where they hope for an increase
of pupils, they pay 50 guineas per an for
the house & garden
