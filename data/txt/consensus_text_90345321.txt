After dinner the boys accompanied us
to Sidney Herberts, and we rambled
through some of its prettiest walks.
This evening was a fine one.
Just at tea time Papa read [insertion]from the Advocate[/insertion] the following
letter written by a mariner to his wife
It is 7th mo/ 30th. The letter unfortunately being
in one of those newspapers which went round
fowl on the pic-nic has vanished so I
could not copy it as I had intended.
