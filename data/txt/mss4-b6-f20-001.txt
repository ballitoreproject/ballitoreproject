Madam,
I have to return you my best thanks for
your letter of 18th Instant, by which I perceive that my Friend
Lieutenant Thom has removed to Scotland, which Circumstance
I regret on my own account, as from the very favorable Description
I have heard of Ballitore, I have some Idea of removing there
early next Spring, particularly on account of its being so short
a distance from Dublin, where my Wifes Friends reside. -
Had Mr. Thom still been resident at Ballitore I should have
requested his Assistance in looking out for a House suitable to
my Wishes, and to have let me known what the Rent (unfurnished)
would be Per Annum; I am now however induced, from your
obliging attention to my former Letter, to beg you will have the
kindess to do so, which will be conferring on me a very particular
obligation; the kind of Residence I should require would
be a small House consisting of Two Parlours, Two Bedrooms, a
Kitchen, and room for a Servant Maid, with a small Garden. -
Any further Information you can give me respecting Ballitore,
the Markets &c. - will be esteemed a favor. - Begging your excuse
for thus troubling you, I remain, Madam
Your obliged and faithful Servant. -
