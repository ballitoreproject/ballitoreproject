began to settle affairs
for the dejeuner - I think
and T H and Sally White
and I lent our aid
in settling the drawing
room. In about an hour
they returned from church
and we spent the interval
between that and the
dejeuner in talking
&c &c - some of them
tried table turning &
to our great astonishment
the table soon began, not
only to turn round,
but to move a few feet,
to satisfy parties a
second trial was made
and with as good success
but alas! it was found
