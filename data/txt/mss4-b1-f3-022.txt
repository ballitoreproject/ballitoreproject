	•	S. to his Children R. and E. S.
P. 70							Dungannon, 17th of Ninthmonth, 1768
		My very Dear Children,
			Though I am personally separated from you at present, I do not forget you, but am sincerely concerned that you may grow in grace, and the inward and saving knowledge of God and Jesus Christ; who, I have in some small degree, at times, since I left home, been made sensible, would be a tender father to his obedient children. *** I should have been pleased with a more particular account of the health of relations and friends, there, than in my son’s two last letters; though, as to my own part, I often find it safest to say and write little. At times I have been filled with fear for S. J.’s son and daughter: do you feel for them and for your own. The temple of the heart ought to be kept clean and disencumbered; the spirit of the world defiles and unfits it for the reception and abode of the heavenly guest.	
											A. S.
