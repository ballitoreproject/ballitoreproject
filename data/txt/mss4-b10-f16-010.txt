March 3 - 1822
Dear Eliza
I congratulate you on the approaching
event which will bring so many of your friends
to Balitore, an event, to which I look forward with feelings
of pleasure, that the happiness of Edward and my sisters
will be greatly encreased by the addition of Such a wife and
Sister to the family circle. We are all eagerly preparing
here for the hauling home which I would be very glad to see
you at, I expect to send this By Sally Fayle who is going
to make her first appearance in Ballitore under very
favourable circumstances. I wish you would send
me an account of the Wedding, and I will in return send
you an account of the hauling home provided you are not
present.
The approach of spring is reviving a great many thoughts
of all the Happy days I have spent in the country, which
I hope will be [deletion]revived[/deletion] [insertion]the[/insertion] forerunner of more, I thank you
for the page of your pocket book, describing part of the many
beauties which Glendaloch brings to my mind, it is not
merely the beauties of nature that makes the recollection
of such days so captivating to the imagination, but also
the reflection that we actually enjoyed the events which

we look back at, with friends whose faces reflected our
own feelings at the time
4th After beginning this letter yesterday I rode out
towards the mountains, as far as the ridge which overlooks
Dublin, where I had the houses and smoke spread
out before me like a map and all around me was
so wild and so cold as to make me prefer a warmer
atmosphere at the bottom, It would not be very pleasant
if the country was so disturbed, as to prevent our usual
excursions during the Summer, the poor people must be
in a dreadful state if all they report about them is true,
but I believe the amounts are greatly exagerated by interested
persons. I have been but twice at the Glen, since you were
here, I found at TillieTudlum a piece of poetry made to
celebrate the beauties of that "lovely Glen" whose "ornament
is an ancient building the residence of W Pim." I suppose
Edward has shewn it to you, Ballitore must divide
the palm now with [unclear]Bromanstorm[/unclear]
Have you read Fitzosbornes Letters, and what think you
of them? Melmoth must must have been a man of great acquirements,
to be able to write so well on the subjects he has
made [deletion]the[/deletion] choice of in composing those Letters, do you

know whether they are real or fictitious? that is if
they were written to real persons and printed under fictitious
names. In looking over the Letters I met with the following
passage, "Methinks we should scarce be so embittered
"against those who differ from us in principle or practice, were
"we oftener to reflect how frequently we have varied from ourselves
" in both those articles," if inconsistency is a crime
it ought to be qualified, if not wholly forgiven, if the person
who changes his opinions, does so from seeing the
erroneousness of those he held, I even think better of
the man who openly avows his change of opinion, wh[unclear][/unclear]
it p[unclear][/unclear]ds from that cause.
[unclear]6th[/unclear] I hear the arrangements for the Wedding are attired
and we are to have it here after all, well, for my
part I am very glad of it, I think it just as it ought,
let who will say to the contrary.
your John
PS I have read the Pirate but I will not tell you any
thing about, only do not have such expectation of it as
to be disappointed on the wrong side.

To
Eliza Gough
Ballitore
