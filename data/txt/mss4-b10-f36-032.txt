Glendruid 6th day Eveng-
My dear Eliza
We arrived here at five oclock
after a pleasant drive the day was beautiful
it cleared up before we got to Ballymore
as that was the road we went, and I
would not recommend it to any one its being
shorter for the road is not good & is very hilly
besides I do not think it is [insertion]as[/insertion] short[deletion]er[/deletion], we
were longer going to Blessington than we
were from that to Dunlavin the day we
went down. we stopped & rested about an
hour at a little lane about three miles
this side of Blessington a nice shady place
my Mother & I were strolling about and a
gentleman rode up to us & asked us why
we did not go up to the house & rest ourselves
and to send the horse to the stable where
we should have oats we thanked him but
did not accept his offer as it was time
for us to resume our journey his name is
Coogan he lives at a place called the horse
shoe, which was formerly an inn, we overtook
Day at Stillorgan so see how slow he travels.
farewell I can say no more only that
my Aunt G is here still with dear love I
am thy affect sister Selina
