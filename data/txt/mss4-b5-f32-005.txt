My Dear friends kind epistles - with the sweet poems
helped to cheer our drooping spirits - for indeed
we are surrounded by gloom - The altogether
unexpected failure of the Waterford Bank with
the stoppage of [underline]our[/underline] long established friends Reall
has Panick struck almost every countenance
capable of feeling - truly we see that the stay & the
staff - are taken away - the mighty men - the judge
& the prophet the president and the ancient - the
honorable man - the councillor
And the people are oppressed every one by another
The child behaves himself proudly against
the ancient & the base against the honorable
[underline]May[/underline] each of us endeavour to be of the righteous
I am afraid that R & S. will feel so uneasy as to
induce them to hurry home, which we would
regret - poor Sarah was of late gratified with
Stephen's company dining at William Allen's he noticed
her & enquired who she was. They had a nice little
meeting after dinner - Stephen, Mary Alexander, & W.
Allen all spoke very [deletion][unclear][/unclear][/deletion]. The latter very beautifully
alluding to the expected separation or parting
from his sole companion Stephen - saying - that time
& distance in this state of mortality was not of moment
as that they were prepared to meet in a future state
dear Stephen expects to sail immediately from Leiverpool
for America - Precious P. Gurney has had a recent

return of human hope from her lungs - and her rapid
decline is now looked for.
Leonie Majolies spoke three times in French of
Sefton house. Lenke Howard interjected, but Sarah
says that any one who had aquired a little
of the language could understand much of
what he delivered - I must not indulge longer
in writing but I should miss the opportunity
we were rejoined to you my GB. C safely
back on 1st. day coming. I am in very dear
love to each of my beloved friends thy
ever sincere C. G. Gibson
