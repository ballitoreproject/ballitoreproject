Settle 9th mo 21st, 1787 -
Dear Molly-/
Thine of the 25th Ultimo. came duly to hand, reach'd me at
Ramsey in Hunts. and was a fresh confirmation that "Love without dissimulation"
does not wax Old as doth a Garment - How like the Christian are those expressions,
that though thou would rejoice to see "me a poor Pilgrim again in yr Land,
yet thou would also rejoice to hear I was "safe[deletion]ly[/deletion] & peaceful at my own home"
And yet as thou observest though the Atlantick is a separation to the Body, tis
the Body only - it is a happiness indeed, that "there is an union of Spirit" which
temporal Changes & occurrences has no power over. - May we [insertion]sufficiently[/insertion] esteem this
priviledge, 'tis the priviledge which the Children of the heavenly family are
entitled to! A priviledge, to which the Children of this World are Strangers!
they cannot intermeddle in that Joy, which under the precious influence
of this Love, felt by the obedient humble followers of the Lamb exceeds "the
Joy of Harvest"! and clothes with gladness of Soul beyond the power of Description -,- -
I have attended to the accts thou givest of Mary Webster, and should I
be permitted to see my native Land again believe I shall not forget to make enquiry
abt such of her Relations as thou mentions, though at present I dont recollect any
knowledge I have had of any of them, except Nicholas Newland of Concord Chester C. &
he has been dead many Years & I think left one Son a hopeful Young Man, who is married
& has several Children - living (if I mistake not) on the same Estate his father did -
Thou hast heard I doubt not of the arrival of our mutually dear
friend M Jenkins, & our Joy thereon has also been mutual - The like comfortable
Tidings I hope we shall have in due time of our other beloved frds. who embark'd
at Gravesend the 26th of 7th Mo in the Pigou left. Sutton bound to Philada.
My dear C: Hustler has been with me since that time, through divers Counties
& reach'd this place last evening on our way to the Qy. Meeting for Cumberland
to be held at Cockermth. next week, which I have felt a secret draught for
some time to attend - and has been no small trial both to Body & Mind to give
up to - but the longer I live, the more I am convinced that in our Obedience to
clear manifestations of Duty stands both our Safety & Peace - may this hint
dear Molly encourage thee to be faithful in little Things, 'tis the alone way to
grow in Strength & Usefulness, and to be entrusted with greater discoveries of the
heavenly father's Will & so to fulfill his merciful Intention in having so often
visited thy Soul, & broke in upon thy Understanding, convincing thy Judgement, that
an Inheritance in divine favour, is of such unspeakably great & glorious importance,
22nd I have lately had a pleasant opportunity of enquiring [unclear][/unclear] American [unclear]J Storres[/unclear]  who are
well & comfortable at home at peace - Dear [unclear][/unclear]
[unclear][/unclear] in to Robertsons she & hers are well & she bids

as that nothing in this World ought to be had in preference to it, or held too dear
to part with when call'd for, in order that it may be obtained, & worthily rejoiced in,
both here & forever.
Dear S Dillwyn has the pleasure of her Husband's company since the
Yearly meeting - He has been engaged with two female fellow labourers in visiting
families on the Surry side of Londn - I have lately heard dear M Ridgeway & J W.
are at Exeter - suppose they will get to their own Land before Winter sets in -
I have heard of dear Joseph Williams's "taking up his Cross" - I rejoiced, tho' was not
at all surprized thereat having believed when I was in his hospitable House, that
he ought to show himself more publickly in Israel - That sweet old woman
S Knott is safely gathered like a Shock of Corn fully ripe - I hope Jos Grubb's
wife has recovered - her's & Husbands illness must be a trial on my precious little
Sally Grubb, who with her dear Robt. are a valuable addition to those I love
in Hibernia - I am pleas'd with thy mention of Wm. Lecky & Wife, please give
mine & C H's love to them & other frds. herein mentioned, particularly J Williams &
Wife who were kind to me as near relations - and to dear A. Taverner, who
having lived so long under much bodily weakness, will if she continues patient
unto the end of her trials here, live for ever in that City where there is no more
sickness [insertion]or[/insertion] Pain -
And so you have had dear Saml. Neal's Company once more at
Ballitore - I shou'd have shared in yr. pleasure had I have been one of yr. [unclear]Company[/unclear]
I love & honour him as a Father, and if it be the Lord's Will to permit him a [unclear]long[/unclear]
stay in this State of conflict - hope it will at the same time prove a [unclear]comfort[/unclear]
the Church, & an increasing blessing to his own Mind in his further [unclear]Refinement[/unclear]
He has not yet wrote me - but as I know I am a poor thing, I dont wonder [unclear]at[/unclear]
[insertion]nor murmur[/insertion] all at his Silence, because I believe he cant help praying for my preservation
which is a favour! When thou writest or seest him next do present him & his dear
Sarah with the remembrance of my dear Love in which I salute thee and thy
worthy Parents & Sister
remaining thy affectionate
frd [underline]R Jones[/underline]
Now a few words to dear Abm. Shackleton -
Thy Lines subjoined to dear Mollys Lettr. were like what the Indians in our
Country call "brightening the Chain" and revived those feelings which were comfortably
cherished towds. thee & thy Worthy Helpmeet when I was at sundry
times under yr Roof- truly thoughts of sisterly kindness still continue in
my Mind, in which I renewedly salute you, wishing the increase of all that is
truly good & worthy the pursuit of all, who are seeking after a "better Country"
"that is an heavenly" because the heavenly Father we are told "is not ashamed
to be called their God, having provided for them a City" Hold fast therefore
the beginning of thy Confidence unto the end, and remember that it is only by
hearkning to & keeping the divine Commandments, that "Peace will flow as a River"

& Righteousness (obedient conformity to the divine Will in successive Acts
of Righteousness) "as the Waves of the Sea" But why should thou assign me
so laborious (if not unsuccessful) an employ. by "charging me" to "charge the Rich."
though I do love the immortal Port the pure Seed, in all, yet to lift up an Axe
upon "the thick Trees" in order to be "famous", requires both Strength & Skill
superior, to the feible attempts I am equal to, and are barely sufficient to move
with among the lowly drooping Plants in the Garden, where I delight to walk,
& water them, remembring those who "Water, shall themselves be "watered" - But tho'
this is a path more easy, it is not always the allotted Path for me, and have sometimes
had with feeble Voice to "Cry aloud" &c - in order that the Penny, the precious
"Penny agreed" for may be obtained, and which to the abundant goodness of the
Master of the Vineyard I may thankfully acknowledge has not been witheld -
Yes Abram I am still in Europe & again in the Northern parts of Gt. Britain
now at Kendal on my way to Cumbd. The foregoing to thy Sister was penned
yesterday - since then we (that is E Hoyland who reach'd me last night at Little
and now with me) have got thus far - and I wish to send this by the Post this even'g
my beloved Compn. CH. is gone back to stay with her precious family till we
return from this Tour, which if we take Lancashire & Westmored. Quay. Meetings
may take a couple of weeks - after which apprehend I may be allow'd to go
into some of the more Southern Counties, hoping to be in readiness to leave
this Country before the next Yearly meeting, & so may miss of ever seeing
some of my dear frds. from yr. Nation - This day begins our Y M'g
at Philada. where now are assembled the Cream of the People; May the
blessed Presence of the grt. master of all right assemblys, make it a solemn
assembly indeed - I'm almost ready to wish (if I dared) that I was one of
their number, but feel a degree of that disposition in which holy Job said
"All my appointed time will I wait &c"
Do make the offer of my Love as general as thou canst, amongst
my kind frds. yr way, to thy Dear Wife, worthy Parents (Pillars in the house
who I trust will no more go forth) and to every one of their dear Childn. at
home & abroad as if named - Dear Sally is in my Debt - If thou &
the rest of yr. Tribe find any thing in yr Budget for me, direct it to
the Care of Jos. Gurney Bevan Plow Ct. Londn. and dont keep it till it is
unseasonable, I love the produce of the Garden as soon as maturated,
tho' in some parts of the nation, they pluck their fruit & lay it by to ripen, more
generally than we do in America - Now farewell & believe me to be thy
old frd & Sister both in teaching & learning (being instructed)
