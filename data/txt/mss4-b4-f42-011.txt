My dear Mother,
the letter, as I would be sorry you thought me unmindful of
you, tho' I have not lately received a letter from Ballitore, but
have heard that sister Lydia was so recovered, as to get out to
meeting, I suppose you hear often from Sally, [underline]I[/underline] do by letters
that come to Uncle Benjamin's family, Robert Dudleys &c.
the last, desire letters to them to be directed to Coal-brook-dale, or
rather I should say Shrewsbury, which has been done -
My Uncle Benjamin was in Cork lately; & desired [insertion]us[/insertion] to inform
thee that there was a dividend of Thomas [unclear]Wyly's[/unclear] debt ready for
thee, by ordering a friend to apply for, & receive it there, Â£260*
[deletion]from[/deletion] he got something also, & left it on us to give thee this
intelligence. We are all thro' favour pretty well, & join in dear
love to you all, hoping to hear soon of your welfare I conclude
*four shillings in the pound,
which he supposed will come to the
above sum, thou are to send a receipt [insertion]to[/insertion] a friend in Cork,
& it's ready for thee in Pike's bank -
Clon 11 of 9 mo - 1793
I wrote to thee, some time ago, hope thou reced
thy affectionate daughter -
