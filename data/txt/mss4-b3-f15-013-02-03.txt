From the same to the same

My dear friend
++ May our dispositions and inclinations be rectified and sanctified; that whatever we do it may be under the Divine blessing, and under the sanction of Divine approbation, may our speaking and our writing be locked & unlocked by the master-key of the Spirit which opens and shuts in pure & perfect wisdom.
+++	I find myself often in the company of friends whom I esteem and love, and yet I do not find much additional satisfaction or edification accrue to my mind from this society - It is not easy at publick times to select individuals, conversation is often interrupted, and sometimes takes a turn neither pleasing nor profitable - let us as much as we can be feelingly cultivating a renewal [page number] 235 of our acquaintance with the divine springthen if in diligently searching for it we meet with some little streams by the way which have issued therefrom, perhaps unlooked for and unexpected, they will be consolatory & refreshing. If we extract any solid comfort and true gratification from the society of any creature, it must be by the adjunction of the Creator - a thousand ciphers, without the addition of that One, are of no value.
