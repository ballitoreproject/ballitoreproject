I should be sorry my jealousy (which I believe is produced by love)
should cause me to say or write any thing improper to my beloved sister, but
I know thy disposition is very far from giving or taking offence; thou (every
thing considered) [deletion]thou[/deletion] art very kind in intelligence, and we are very sociable
in communicating the subject of our letters to catch [insertion]other [/insertion]so that it seems immaterial
whom thou write to. I pity thee & wish I had some of thy work to help
thee with, when I shall go I can not yet say: perhaps the 3 month might be
timely enough; I am concerned to hear poor cousin Sally's spirits are low; I
hope she will do bravely, my very dear love attends her: do not suffer thine
to lag, you both have affectionate husbands who I believe would sympathize
with you, if acquainted with your grief. I believe every heart has some secret
grievance of their own. I am pleased to hear Betty Malone is mending.
I believe Molly has collected all the hens stirring in our Village, she
is able to give a better account of aunt and her family than one could: a few days ago
things bore but a poor aspect, aunt had a very severe pit of her old headache, Betty
Widdons a great pain in her back, occasioned (it was apprehended) by a cold,
either in repeatedly changing her cloaths preparatory for her going to the meeting
with mother who went on the car fearing to go in the chair on account of the
frost so Betty prepared for going, but hearing again the chair was to go, she undressed,
& so when the car was concluded on, she had to dress again; thou knows
how aunt does be affected by Betty's indisposition, cousin Hannah was pulled
down by pain & want of rest, which is very nourishing & requisite for a person of
her years, she is now become brother's patient, it is hoped she has received benefit
poor cousin Abby came much alarmed about her matter, her stay with us is likely
to be near a week longer than I believe she would stay did not duty, affect on and

friendship compel her to it. I spent a week with her lately, I pitied her lonely
situation; she had plucked up her spirits, which she says has had a good effect[deletion]s[/deletion]
thou I believe knows any meaning. Their wonky Landlord & his wife have had
some affliction of late, their only daughter a very amiable woman (Abby compares
to her sister Christy) has lately lost a very affectionate husband, a wonky man
such is his character: had not talents to provide largely for his family,
a neighbour of theirs was he[insertion]re[/insertion] lately, he told us the deceased had a daughter
by a former wife, five by his latter, the dying man's bed was surrounded
was likely soon to be without father and mother: George Dacoe observing it and
apprehending he was concerned much on her account, very affectionately strove
to relieve his maid by asking him she should be as much the object of his care
as his own own daughter's children, a very strong act of kindness this was, it is not
doubted but he will fulfill his promise, a great harmony (it is said persisted
between this young woman and her mother, she is niece to Betty Box Jacob Goff's.
Mother is well pleased thou seems to approve of her advice
& intend sleeping in the Green-room; it pleases me much that thou hast continued
for me to be in the room with thee I should not be easy to be far off. I hope thou
does not imagine I should think much of being disturbed, my chief concern about
myself is fearing I should be deficient in care, but hope to do my best. We
want to know when thou reckons to exactly & whether the 3 month will answer
for me to go, if necessary sooner I believe mother would permit me to go: thou
knows our situation, not that I apprehend I can be of much service at home;
yet I would gladly endeavour to be of some service. Mother likes the butter
very well; the last brother sent, the former answers very well for paste: my
candle-light work is knitting brothers very fine b wo[insertion]r[/insertion]sled [/unclear]
Cousin Jonathan
Haughton

Haughton here, he sends his love to thee. Nancy Gatchet was not at our last
pooriace meeting, her husband was. I had a letter from her wrote in good spirits
very pressing for our family to lodge with her at the next meeting; she desires
to know when we heard from thee & how thou art; she seems well acquainted with
the duties of a wife Betty Gatchet has a fine daughter, mother & child barely
Nancy Peisly very poorly, Molly Ridgway's marriage draws fast on & Goodbody
& Betty Pim [insertion]Daughter of Rob Pim[/insertion], Jenny Watson commends Hannah Jackson very much,
speaks very well of Lydia Mellar, what a strange thing or [insertion]how [/insertion]unkind it was to
spread such a report of her. Sally Pim acknowledges herself in thy debt, writes
in her usual friendly manner, quite silent with regard to a certain affair, wishes
she had my father at her elbow. There are seasons when the counsel of a friend
should be a balm, & yet it seems ordered in true widsom that our desympathize
must centre in Heaven, these are Sally's own words, Poor dear John me secret
suppose endured a good deal of pain with his eye ahead he bore what compares
Please remember me very affectionately to Molly Roberts I intend
soon replying to her affectionate letter, cousin Becky I am in her debt too. Well,
as to my face which I had like to forget, I took ten pills, the lime-water which
my stomach almost refused, I now have stop[insertion]p[/insertion]ed as directed, my face is now
finely. Please remember us respectfully to thy father & mother, thy
brothers & sister, Our very dear love to [underline]our [/underline]Sam as I used to call him, before
I had any expectation of his being so nearly allied to us.
I believe this is a very incoherent piece of stuff, thou know what
sort of a place our parlour is to write in, variety of tongues.
Farewell, my dear sister, be assured I am thy very affectionate
sister
