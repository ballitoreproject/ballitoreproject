My dear Elizth
I must call on thee again to try to get
Mary Kilmurray to come to us [deletion][/deletion], when
I wrote to Deborah yesterday I mention'd my wish
to get M K to her, but did not hurry her, I now write
that there may be no time lost & would be much
obliged if thou'd take the trouble of sending to her [insertion]to ask if she wd come[/insertion]
[unclear][/unclear] sending his answer to me, that I may [unclear][/unclear]
to get some one else in case she cannot come
I suppose Lydia left you to day I long to hear
how she likes her new home & new friends, but must
have patience until she tries them, thou seems fated
to have one or other of us on thy hands, I shall
look for thee the beginning of next month I hope
thou wilt be ready to come early I would say the
latter end of this month but that I think thou
would not like to come untill we have the house
to ourselves - with dear love to you all I remain
thy affectn sister S Barrington
