Dear Miss Leadbeater
Sept 6 1826
It was with great
concern that I perused your letter relating
the death of your excellent Mother.
It is a loss that will be felt and lamented
by many, hers was a truly useful life, and
many will rise up and call her blessed
who have been animated by her example
and instructed by her writings - In our
View she is gone too soon, and has left
a Void not easily filled up, but God
judgeth not as Man judgeth, he saw her ripe

for the Joys of heaven to which she is gone.
I deeply very deeply lament her sufferings
but these from the hand of a God of Love,
were only a further trial of that faith which
is now crowned by enjoyment
"Faith is the lively evidence
of things unseen by mortal eyes,
It passes all the bounds of sense,
and penetrates the inmost Skies."
The firmness and her skill were evinced in
the last order respecting her mortal remains.
Indeed she was an excellent Creature.
and she is gone to her kindred Skies, a home
of Joy because of Love.
Mrs Finn may well lament your dear
Mother, she was to her a wise and steady
Friend. I delight to hear of Owens respectability
and he cannot better shew his attachment
to your Parent, than by persevering in that
path of Virtue in which she once told me,
that he delighted to tread. I have enclosed
two little poems written by my dear Mrs Barbauld
which I will trouble you to give to him, I think
that he will admire them. It will give

me much pleasure to hear that his unfortunate
Brother in law is reclaimed.
I trust that your Father is supported under
this great bereavement and that he will yet
be spared to his afflicted family
I am with thanks for your kind but sad
Letter very Sincerely yours
Frances Smith
Should any interesting event occur in your
Village to those of whom your good Mother has
been accustomed to write I shall be obliged
by the communication.
