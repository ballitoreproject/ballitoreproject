Templeville 19th of 12th month 1810. -
My dear friend,
On different accounts I would willingly pay
effectual attention to thy letter of the 6th but, in general, it is difficult
to procure advantageous situations for Clerks & the present time is particularly
unfavourable - I have made enquiry & mean to continue it,
with intention to inform thee, without delay, should any thing occur
worth communicating - I should suppose that thou or some other
has written to Jas.h Massey Harvey on the subject - He is expected to be
here away next week when I intend speaking to him about GP [unclear][/unclear]
I have heard with concern of my cousin L W's serious indisposition
I wish to be remembered affectionately to her & James, who is truly
to be felt for, & whose real worth we are sensible of - I had also heard
of thy sister Sally's sight being poorly & wish to hear of its amendment
No doubt you know of [unclear]Epenrade[/unclear] (Johnstown) having been long tried
with heavy illness, a dropsy, for wch she was tapped, & under one
operation, had, I understood about 13 quarts of water taken from her -
a letter from her husband lately mentioned the apprehension of
her not continuing many days - I was there in company with our
friends John Conran & Henry Hull, but she was [insertion]too[/insertion] weak for them to see
I

I believe H. H is now in Co. Tipperary - J. C went homeward
from Limerick. - They paid an acceptable visit to
our meeting &, generally [deletion]to[/deletion][insertion]visited[/insertion] the families of friends here -
I want to have Â£ 2:8 - to be paid, the first of next month
to my old kind friend, Betty Pope, & would ask thy
husband to do so much for me, charging it to my acct
& requesting a line from him or thee informing there of
My salutation of love to him & [deletion]oth[/deletion] her, & others with you.
I am, dear Mary, thy affecte. friend
I believe Jane Robinson
James Abell,
is pretty well in health. -
