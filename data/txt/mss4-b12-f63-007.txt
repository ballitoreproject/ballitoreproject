It appears to me that Dease & Lalor are not
justifiable in their proceedings, Dease should have
made up his costs & got them regularly taxed by the
master & then demanded them from the coheiresses & in
default of payment the lease by White for lives the
right to which is in the coheiresses should have been
sold: this course I collect has not been pursued: but
Lalor has purchased from Dease his rights under the Decree
& has now [insertion]his[/insertion] lease & the claims of Dease against the
lease of the coheiresses. In this case it seems that an
ap[insertion]p[/insertion]lication should be made to the court on the part of the
coheiresses to have the bills taxed & they should offer
to pay them or have the lease sold to pay them & get
the overplus of the money it sells for divided among
them. They can have no benefit under the Decree
untill Dease's costs are paid because Dease was at
the expence of establishing the lease against White
Lalor now stands in Dease's place & he must be paid
the taxed costs, but he has no right to Noble's lease nor
any Interest in it farther than his alien on it for the
costs due to Dease in whose place he now stands &
