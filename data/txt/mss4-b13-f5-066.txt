afterwards a storm came on, which indeed
was dreadful- I never passed through such agony
of mind I think. It did not last long.
13th.. The mornings news,- that the Liverpool-
packet had indeed been beaten about in the
storm, but had got safe back to a sheltered
anchor place:- had received but little damage.
14th.. week-day meeting- ah! what a state of mind
to go to meeting in. Robt.. & Benson wrote to the
Captain, proposing, if he thought proper, to
send dear S:T on shore, & Sarah wrote to
[underline]her[/underline] wishing her to come: but no Sarah was
sent, but two letters to me from her,- written
in true affection, & making the best she cou'd
of a trying situation. 15th.. account received that
the Liverpool packet has really sailed: I had
letters from dear Sarah written in the ship.
16th.. wrote letters. 17th.. First-day. Missed my
dear companion much: thought I felt
sweet peace to flow in my mind in the morning
meeting, & hoped my dear S:T felt the
same, on the watry element. 18th.. Robt.. & Sarah
