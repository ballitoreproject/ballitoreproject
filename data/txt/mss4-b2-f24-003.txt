Clonmel 16th of 1st month 1777

My dear Father,
	Thy last very kind letter I received, for which & the receipt I am exceedingly obliged to thee, & purposed writing by the return of the post, but was prevented by company coming to [word crossed out] us [?] next day by being at Fathers almost all day, & yesterday by having Mother to dine ^sup^ with us, thy writing at the meeting time when surrounded by thy friends encreased [sic] the favour. I wrote without dating my letter, that was occasioned chiefly by an alarm that the post was going out, I thought of the omission after the letter went, but as that to Aunt was dated judged it might inform when thine was written. Before I forget, to clear us of the imputation of having need of the receipt I will inform who wants it, our Prentice Gabriel is the person. I was concerned for poor Nancy Peisley, shall be pleased to hear how she continues. I should like to hear from our old beloved friend Nancy Getchell: I intend to get the Blatorea seed for Mother when opportunity offers. I am much obliged for thy remembrance I care about the Kettle, I have got it, perhaps thro thy attention. It is pleasing that we employ thy thoughts even in sleep, & hope we thus [sic] favoured by day also.
	Brother John does not stand the worse chance for having Joseph & Elizabeth Pike for friends, Father had a letter from him since, he says little about his errand to England, only that he hopes things have not a worse aspect, or some encouraging sentence like that, we have had great storms here, & are anxious on his account, Father keeps mostly in the country, Mother visits him sometimes, how irksome to have Man & wife so separated, thou would soon be enquiring Wheres the Mistress.
	I remember very well hearing of this Elizabeth Cox, a variety of sensations had place in my mind on reading that part of thy letter, I was anxious she should see you, pleased with her getting to you (as I expected in the sequel) & provoked & disappointed at the baulk: it was really vexatious: poor Woman, it will be happy for her if she experiences strength & stability to press forward thro her afflictions into a Land of rest, if we have the pleasure of enjoying the smiles of kind Providence, temporal, outward afflictions may be rendered comparatively light, but to have i^n^ward distresss distress arising from a guilty mind wounds the spirit ^indeed^, but there is need of this most excellent ingredient Divine comfort to sweeten the cup of affliction: those ^who^ are tryed [sic] I believe know it to be so, those in prosperity may quietly reason about woes they do not feel.
	Sam hopes when Mothers tries the butter sent last that it will be agreeable.
	Our dear love & duty attend her, thee & Aunt.
		From thy Dutiful
			affectionate Daughter,
