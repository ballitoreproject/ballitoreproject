From Mary Shackleton 7th of 6th mo: 1772
Twas with great [insertion]pleasure[/insertion] I heard my Mother
say "I have a letter for thee Hannah" &
with greater pleasure I perused the
contents. If we made a macth to tell
each other our faults, I hope thou wilt
not be angry at my telling thee a fault
I found in thy letter it was thy paying
me so many compliments, shall I say at
the expence of truth I know it is thy
partiality for me that makes thee
think me so much cleverer than I am,
for I know thou would say nothing
that thou did not think: let us now
make another match not to compliment
each other, we may think thou knows
but not say. Indeed I am too apt to
be puff'd up with any little thing, &
this is nothing to my credit.
Last night I was taking a walk
& I met Brutus so we walk'd a good
deal & he came home & supp'd with
us, my Mother is very fond of him. I
am bravely now of a hurt I got lately
ask Kitty & she'll tell thee all about
it. Thou knows the match (for
we are great match-makers) we

made to tell each other whatever [unclear]one[/unclear]
heard said of the other well I tell
something. I was yesterday at Friend
Clever's (a clever name an't it?) & she
ask'd me was my Cousin Jenny gone,
I said yes, & could scarce refrain
from tears, said she "I wish I could
have had the [deletion][/deletion] pleasure of
"having her a week or two with
me, she is [insertion]a[/insertion] sweet girl I do not know
one I have a greater love for," I join'd
in all her praises & between us if [deletion]she[/deletion] [insertion]thou[/insertion]
wert not well praised I wonder at it.
Well said the clever friend, "she is
"an amicable girl, both in her person
"& mind & behaviour, she is a charitable
young creature I was at her
"Mothers once, about a year or two
"ago there was a poor woman at
"the door & she had but sixpence
"in her pocket & she gave it to her
"& told her if she had more she should
"be welcome to it." was not it enough
to make me jealous, but all she said
was true her son I believe will fall
in love with thee for he heard all
the praise & Paris & Brutus were by


too. I saw Paris's pretty eyes sparkle
with joy when he heard thee praised
I have a very bad pen I
fear this is not legible I must get
a better for tho' I make free with
thee as the saying is "I must not spur
the free horse to death." I believe Fanny
will write to thee. I was sorry to hear Friend
Unthank was ill, but am glad she is better,
her daughter intends writing to her soon.
Thou art not a clever girl to make so
 many shirts, I told it to friend Clever.
now as thou asks me what book to invite
thee to read, as thou hast read the Roman
History I would advise thee to read [deletion]Hum[/deletion]
Humes History of England, I have read
it 'tis very pretty & fine languague, I have
not read the Roman history, but am going
to begin it which would [unclear]thou[/unclear] advise
me to read the universal or Rollins
Roman History, [deletion]I think I[/deletion]
When shall my eyes be [unclear][/unclear]
with a sight of my beloved Jenny? ah!
not this great while I fear. I forgot to
tell thee I have got a new Spark dont
thee know Tom Jones I got a letter from
him 'twas very breif here it is.

My Charmer
I am in love with you & will
die, if you do not by a sweet smile ease
your dying lover. Tom Jones. What [unclear]dost[/unclear]
thou think of that. All my sisters [insertion]& Brother[/insertion]
join me in love to thee, Kitty, Johny,
Hannah, Molly, Sally [unclear]Peggy[/unclear] & Debby, Aby
is just doating on thee & Johny he
say "I love Jenny, & I love Johny better
"because he is a boy, & oh that's true my
"poor old sweet Aunt I love her mighty
"well because she gives me Goodys & pets me.
"but she should not spoil such a fine child
as I am." I see my paper is full therefore
must bid thee Adieu H Pennington
7/6 mo. 1772
My Love to Sally Lampard.
Jane Penn
Bountiful-hall.
