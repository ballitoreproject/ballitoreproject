Foston 1st Mth 15th 1784
I do not forget that I am indebted to my
Dear Cousin Molly for a letter by Uncle Shackleton
last 6th Mth - I esteem every communication with
your family too valuable to pass unnoticed - I often
reflect on my [insertion]visit to[/insertion] Ballitore that Goshen of Ireland & on
[insertion]your [/insertion]unbounded kindness to me a poor Stranger when there
& nothing unpleasing arises therefrom but that distance
& situation renders a personal intercourse mostly impracticable
with you, & that thereby I have not the opportunity
of greeting you in this Land, or County, so frequent
as I cou'd wish, nevertheless as our annual assembly in
London calls for representatives i hope thy valued Parents
will not cease to work in this good & necessary Cause
& it is in opinion here that he ought not to come in
future without a Molly, a Sally &c if they can be obtained
not only for his own good & safety but that the Churches
here & [underline]that[/underline] in our family may have the opportunity of
becoming more familiarly acquainted with yours, & I
so hope that next summer we shall have that satisfaction
& if I shoud happen to be in London with my
Husband we shall expect the liberty of taking [insertion]charge [/insertion] of you
from thence into our County - My mind has not
only been attached to the elder but, [insertion]to [/insertion] the younger branches
of your family in the comfortable sense of divine favor
you-ward - may you choose it for your everlasting portion
& purchase it with the surrender of every unsubstantial
enjoyment - cast down the little Crowns of natural
accomplishments & science, & behold your king coming unto
you, having salvation, riding upon an Ass & a Colt the

Ansd. -10/4 -

the Foal of an Ass, embrace this heavenly visitant
with devotedness of heart; that being the God of your
Parents he may be graciously pleased eminently to
discover himself to be your God by enduing you with
spiritual gifts & making you as stakes in Zion-
I understand by Uncles last letter that thou
made a long visit in the north with thy fr'ds there
among whom I suppose is rank'd our mutual fr'ds
J. &. L. Conran of whose welfare I shou'd be glad to
hear [insertion]not [/insertion] having exchanged one word with them since
we left Ireland & heard very little about them any
way - is Lucy likely to encrease her Husbands
family - if not I conclude they will come to England
next Summer. - We are but just return'd
home after a months absence during w'ch we paid
a visit to our near fr'ds & Relations John & Betsy
Hogland &c whose worth in every sense of the word
I believe thou wou'd greatly value did thou know
them - We talk'd about Ireland when together &
& challenged one another to step over to your next
half year Meeting in Dublin a prospect which
at first view had something pleasing in it but
when the proposition is tried in the fire in
all probability , it will there be consumed.
Remember us very affectionately to Cousin
Abraham & Lydia & any Ballitore frds in thy
freedom as Aby Haughton &c also to Molly Hudson
& Nanny McConnaughty - a double Portion attends
my Dear frd thy Sister Sally & myself being in haste
may just [insertion] say that[/insertion] dear Molly thy affectionate
S. Grubb Robt
