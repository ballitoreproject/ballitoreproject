Ballitore 20th of 1 mo: 1826 -
Dear Edwd.
I am not anxious to make use of
this term in respect to assessing Execution - but
I wd. like to put forward the business for a future
day - Suppose the Judgm.t on the Â£300 Bond
was revived & an assignmt. of that Judgmt. made
by P. Fitzsimons to me, [insertion]that[/insertion] for the present might answer -
or could the two Judgm.ts be made over in the one Assignmt.,
& how many years might expire before it would be
out of date for reviving a Judgment ? what would the
cost be of reviving one or both Judgments & the assignmt.
I would like to get one of them revived & Assigned immediately
as P. Fitzsimons is now here, but he will be
soon going to reside in Kilkenny - he wishes for
something to be done in the business in expectation
of getting something more for himself
thy sincere frd.
