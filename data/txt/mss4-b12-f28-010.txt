now that I have given an outline of our
journey here from Carlsruhe I
may tell some particulars -
We got a letter from Dr Henry on
arriving here telling us to meet
him at Milan as his passport wont
let him come here - where we
go there I know not; he wants us
to go [insertion]down[/insertion] into Italy with him but Uncle
won't do that & I am glad of it
I do not know where to tell you
to direct to us - So dont write till
you hear from us again wh I hope
wont be long - at least we dont intend
to be so long as we have been but we
could not help it - when we see Dr Henry
we will know what we will do so
can write then - It seems three
months instead of three weeks since
I left home - Does that time seem short
to you, [insertion]oh[/insertion] how long it is [underline]to me[/underline] I will
be glad to get back again - -
Italian spoken here & Italian
manners - I like the northern part
of Switzerland better - the houses
here - I mean from Hospenthal
here - are not as nice nor as

[deletion]as those[/deletion]
clean - neither are the people, many
of them are as bad as our Irish
or worse - but I believe the
Italians are famous for being
dirty - I wd much rather have
the Germans & the French -
though they are dirty & poor looking
here they are more industrious
than the Irish - [insertion]I might make an exception of [underline]this town[/underline], many idle here[/insertion] It is hard to
tell whether I like this or Brunnen
better - I believe Brunnen, the mountains
are bolder over the lake there
than here -
A most delightful country Switzerland -
is at least what I have seen of it
Still I wd rather have [unclear]Boherboy[/unclear] Cottage
than it all put together -
In the northern part of Switzerland
we got excellent butter & honey
 [underline]not here[/underline] - & up at the [unclear]Furka[/unclear] &
Hostpenthal were the [underline]only[/underline] places
we got cream - at Faido it was
little cans we got with water instead
of jugs in the basins - [deletion]the latter[/deletion]
what we have [underline]here[/underline] are like
shaving mugs with spouts. -
the basins we get here are various
shapes some like our Irish ones others
like baking dishes, & Salade bowls
The Hotel at [unclear]Fiske[/unclear] [deletion]we[/deletion] is made of
[underline]wood[/underline] we got down quilts there
as large as small feather beds -
we wanted them; I slept very comfortable
under them in the midst of the snow -
just imagine a winters day on the
 18 of Aug - coming from Faido
yesterday we stopped three hours
in Bellinzona where we dined
while there a procession passed
I believe on their way to church
Such a motley crowd I never saw
They were accompanied with 14 priests -
It is a great comfort to have this day
quiet here - Tomorrow I believe we
go to Milan where we remain
till the 25th - I am sure Uncle Tho
will not be back in Ballievey on the 1st
of September - however if he stays
in Dublin long enough for me to go
home for 2 or 3 [deletion]th[/deletion] days I am satisfied
we will be 4 weeks away by the time
this letter gets to Dunlavin - How are
the Chrysanthemums doing that I brought
home - if you pot them water them [underline]well[/underline]
The G C says to pot them when the

flower buds are beginning to
form -
We are not keeping to the route
Uncle Richd laid out for us & I am
sorry - I hope we wont go back without
seeing Mount Blanc if we do Aunt
says Uncle must take us again -
Tuesday 22nd - Your letters came
safe this morning they have put
me into good spirits some way
or another I have not been right
since I was up at the Furka -
I am sorry for poor Mrs Kilbee - no
wonder at Mr Kilbee being in a
terrible way - Poor [unclear]Fido[/unclear] & Cupid why
did you put "our card to them" -
in such a hurry - So M A Boone
has answered the advertisement
Do you think you will take
her again - I dont know what
to say to it - Do not expect us to write
[underline]often[/underline] you dont know what travelling
is if you expect us to do so -
continually moving except while
we are sleeping - I am glad to
hear you are [underline]all[/underline] well at
home - I hope you may continue so
