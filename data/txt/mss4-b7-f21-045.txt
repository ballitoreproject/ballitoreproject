I am a very poor poor sorry creature, forlorn & cast
away from all my usual comforts - yet let me not
repine at the dispensations of Providence; the hand
that has woken, can by this almighty [unclear]Feat[/unclear], raise me
up again in an instant - how can I presume to
murmur, such an idea be it far from me, such an
idea be it far from me, such an idea for ever banished
from me, let me not presume to indulge such a one
even in temper, but let cheerfulness supply the plan
f [unclear] x x x[/unclear], & as duty let the whole of my conduct speak
more loudly than I am able to utter, Father, not my
[unclear][/unclear], but thine be done - Do I not know his will is
the almighty disposer of events, & have I not many [unclear][/unclear]
comforts which I have great reason to thank God for -
I can lift up my soul in grateful acknowledgment
for his [deletion][/deletion] x x very thankful to live - but if his good
providence administer comfort to me let me [unclear]x x [unclear][/unclear]
submissive to his -
