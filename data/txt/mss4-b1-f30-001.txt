two Dreams
[underline]Which where Dream't one Night in the 10th mo 1778[/underline]
I thought I felt myself Dying and seem'd
sensable of a final Struggle; when as if
my Spirrit had left its Earthly Confinement
was permitted to Assend to Regions of Celestal
Glory - I follow'd one that Vouchsaf'd to
be my Guide who discover'd to me the many
oh the Wonderful privedleges the Blessed
Inhabitence of this desireable Abode enjoy'd
Was then inform'd this was Heaven -
The Place appear very Extencive surrounded
with such a light as I never beheld before
O' such a Wonderfull brightness that appear'd
is far very far beyond Expression or decription
An uncommon harmonious Melody was
heard or rather felt which seem'd like a
Continue'd tribute of Adoration and Praise
I thought I was now enterd over into
Ever lasting Happyness and that all Sorrow was
at an End - only one wish remaind d which
was if it where possable for some Individuals
then in the Body to possess if where but for
'a few moments a degree of the Perfect enjoyment
I was favor'd to Experience that it might encourage
them so to Walk as to be Worthy to gain Admittence.

into this Glorious Habitation when Time to
them should be no More
I communicated this desire with a
degree of earnestness to my Heavenly Guide
who Smile'd [deletion]and discover'd Himself[/deletion] and
Intimated that their was an Invisable Power
if rightly Attended to that would Guide and
direct them in saftey towards this happy
land but that they must be [unclear]Crucyfyd[/unclear]
to the World and the World unto them
before they could be made pertakers of
this Blessed Inheritence
It was then and [insertion]not[/insertion] till then discover'd
to me whom it was that was thus talking
to me Even no less then our Blessed
Redeemer - Oh the awefullness and fear
that now cover'd my Spirit cannot be
describe'd - may it at Times never
be forgot by me
I was then told that this was but
a foretaste of what I should Everlastingly
enjoy if I was but faithfull unto Death
Thou must again return to the Earth there
to endure temptation and Persecution for
the Sake of true Religion in Order to
Prove thy Faith and thy Love -
I was then shewen a Place where was [unclear]the[/unclear]

Sound of Distress of Mourning Bitterness
[deletion]and[/deletion] Limentation Dicord and Contention this
I was told was the Place of Punishment for
the Wicked Unrightous and Disobedient
the Place appear'd very Dark and Gloomy
was not permitted to enter[deletion]y[/deletion] in[deletion]to[/deletion] [deletion]the[/deletion] only to
look at a Distance
the thought of returning to the Earth
became now very distressing to me - I
pleaded my Weakness my fear of falling
short in true Obedience to what might
be require'd - But was favor'd with a
sense that I should be strenthen'd [deletion]even[/deletion]
in the Hour of Temptaion tryal if I
Steadiley look [insertion]to[/insertion] Him who had thus condesended
as I thought to speak so Intelligabley to
Me - which made one fear to be unwilling
to return to this Land of Tryal least
it should border on Unbeleif
I just took another survey of this [deletion]Happy[/deletion]
Heavenly Habitation and was conducted
to the Place which I thought [deletion] I had [/deletion] at first
I had forever left and resume'd this
Earthly Tenement I then awoke my
Mind cover'd with a sweet Composure
