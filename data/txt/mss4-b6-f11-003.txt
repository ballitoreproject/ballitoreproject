dear Mary
Herewith I send
I send thee Cowpers life
for the kind loan of which,
I and my friends feel ourselves
much obliged, I also
send one of the Ben's letters
which thou wrote for and
the other which was address'd
to my father, I expect he
will himself be the bearer
of tomorrow. I will be
obliged by thy enquiring abt

"Modern Philosophers" which
I sent to Ballitore for Miss
Robinsons perusal, & if you
are quite done with "Charles
12 roi du Suede" I should
be glad to have it back
but not 'till you are
all filled with it to
satiety.
I remain thy
very affte friend
S. Haughton junr.
