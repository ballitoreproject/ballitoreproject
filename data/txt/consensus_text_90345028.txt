3th- Another lovely morning
I came to town with Papa,
After dinner as Charlie
and I were invited
out to Bushfield Avenue
to tea, I went out soon
after dinner as Charlie
could not well come
until late in the evening,
I walked all the way
and found it hot and
tiresome work enough,
arrived there at about
6Â½ - found Nannie
in the kitchen settling
things things for tea. so having
taken off my things
I went to help her and
cut the bread and butter,
She missed Aunt Liddy
