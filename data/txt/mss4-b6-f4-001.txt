New York 12th Month 20th 1816
Dear Friend
A vessel being likely to sail in
a few days from this to Dublin, I did not like to let her
go without taking a few lines from me in reply to thy acceptable
letter dated 2nd of 8 month, which was left at Bell & Bownes
office for me, I suppose by C. Finn, for I did not see him, happening
to be out at the time he called, & he never repeated
his visit, at which I was both surprised & disappointed, for
I should have given him every assistance in my power in
finding employment for him - Neither have I seen Joseph Doyle,
the lad whom thou mentions, nor do I know where to seek him -
however I hope he may yet call as he knows the office -
I was sorry to learn by thy letter of the sickness, &
since of the death of Margaret Shackleton, but I am persuaded
that to her the change is for the better, & I am inclined to think
that the release from suffering ought to be a source of as much
joy as sorrow to her relations & friends -
You have indeed your trouble in Ballitore, but where
is the spot without them? & how few are there who live long
without meeting disappointment or loss of some kind?
By all accounts from your side it appears that the
summer was very cold, or correctly speaking, that there was no
summer at all. - The people here [insertion]also[/insertion] told us that they never experienced
so cold a summer in this country [insertion]before[/insertion], so that your lot
was not singular - however for my part I would never wish
to feel hotter weather than we had in New York in the 7th
8th, & 9th months - The Thermometer often stood at 86° in the shade
once or twice at 92° - then it was, the perspiration descended
off us like rain - & let us remain ever so still the heat seemed almost
too much to bear, - we wore the thinnest clothes, & even they
were too oppressive - I had a large broad brimmed straw hat

which I generally wore into town on hot days - I would have
cut a curious figure in Limerick with it on me, but it attracted
very little attention here -
I am glad you seemed pleased with my townsman
Lord Glentworth's humane attention to the poor man whom
thou mentions having been hurt at Belan - but I wonder what
took him to that part of the country -
I think George Shackleton had begun to build his house
before I left Ballitore, but am not quite certain, however I
am glad it is finished & hope he will soon procure the
most [underline]important part of furniture[/underline], & not set up an old bachelor's
house -
I am sorry Thos Fisher should let the Magazine
flag behind so, those that he published were so entertaining -
surely the Muse of the "Classic Vale" has not discontinued to inspire
her votaries -
What I have seen of this country has pleased me
much, & this city is perhaps as pleasant a place to live in as
any in the United States - It is a place of immense trade, &
has more business with Europe than any other or perhaps than
all the other Amern. cities - so that we are seldom many weeks
together without hearing from England & Ireland, which is particularly
agreeable to us - Thousands of [underline]poor Paddies[/underline] have arrived
here, this last year, & many of them have been foolish enough to
go back with their fingers in their mouths, instead of penetrating
[insertion]into[/insertion] the interior of the country & seeking for employment,
plenty of which is to be had, a little way back from the coast,
But these "Geniuses of Hibernia's Isle" expecting to get dollars for
little trouble & light work, finding themselves disappointed are
unwilling to exert themselves as becomes the hard working sons of
[underline]Adam[/underline], & therefore prefer returning once more to the [underline]pratees[/underline] &
[underline]salt[/underline].
A few weeks ago I took a trip up the River
Hudson to a town about 64 miles distant from New York -
I went in a steam boat which was a new mode of conveyance
to me, never having seen one before my arrival here -
The noise & smell of the Engine are unpleasant, & there is a
sameness which I think rather tiresome for a long way - but on the

whole I would much rather travel in one of them than in
the Stage Coaches which are used in this Country -
We had beautiful weather during our tour, which made the
Country thro' which we passed look to great advantage - Some
of the scenery exceeds any thing I ever saw [insertion]before[/insertion], particularly in one
part called the Highlands, where the cliffs or hills at either side
of the river rise almost perpendicular to the height of 1500 feet -
these covered with trees of all sizes, have a sublime effect particularly
in the Fall of the year when the foliage is of such
rich colours -
The cold weather seems about setting in, but
as yet we do not complain much, except in the mornings
when it is rather [underline]chilly[/underline] getting out of a warm bed. but they tell
us here we must say nothing until our very breath freezes
as it come out of our mouths - if that be the case, I hope I shall
have no occasion to complain - the ice is sufficiently hard for
skating, & at Albany (about 160 miles from this) it bears large
waggons across the Hudson - We have had no snow in
this city yet, & of course no sleighing - I wish for
the latter [unclear]never[/unclear] having seen any of it - but I expect to
be fully [unclear]gratified[/unclear] ere long -
Some customs here surprised me at first, but
I look on em as quite natural - We have got into the habit of [unclear]eating[/unclear]
nearly as much meat at breakfast as at dinner - quite the fashion here -
The wood[deletion]s[/deletion] fires I think very comfortable, superior to coal & equal perhaps
to turf - they use very few grates in this country - mostly plain
hearths, with iron bars to lay the sticks across on - There are an
immense number of Wooden houses in this city, which is one reason
why fires are so frequent - a very great one happened about two
weeks since [insertion]which[/insertion] consumed near 50 houses before it was got under
I was up at it all night, & never did I behold such an awful
& grand sight the flames ascended in all directions & seemed to
burn fiercer, the more water was thrown on them - there was
as might be expected great confusion & destruction of property -
it broke out at about 1/2 past 11 - & continued until 4 o'clock next
morning - The Corporation do not allow a wooden house to be
rebuilt in the city when once burned - which is perfectly right -

Mary Leadbeater
Post Office
Ballitore
letter from thee will always
prove acceptable to me -
Please tell my bro. James that
I wrote to him some weeks since
[unclear]via[/unclear] Dublin
Mary Rath desires her affect. love
to thee & thy sister Sally
Peter Widdows if I can make him out - tell Abby that Robert Browne remembers
him very well, but has not heard much of him these some
years - The Letter which thy sister Sally sent me, I forwarded on
to Sarah Talbot, long since, by a particular friends of mine, who knew
her well - & I have no doubt it has arrived safe - If ever she wishes to
send any more letters, enclose them to me & I will take care of them -
I delivered the few lines to Mary Bell for which she is obliged - she was
very much attached to her Grandmother, which was no wonder - We have
enjoyed good health since our arrival & have not [deletion]been[/deletion] suffered from the change
of climate in any degree - Want of paper obliges me to conclude with
thy affecte. friend - Jacob Harvey
affectionate remembrance to all my acquaintances
in Ballitore as if particularly named -
[underline]per Ship Dublin Packet.[/underline]
Samuel Clibborn son to Cooper Clibborn & who was my schoolfellow at Ballitore has
been in this country for a year or more, he is at present turned [underline]schoolmaster[/underline]
& is teaching in the state of New Jersey, a few miles from this city - with what
success I cannot say - He was for a while in Stephen Grellet's employ, but was
too unsteady & did not remain there long - he got into some scrapes in this
City - & came off I believe [underline]second best[/underline] - I never had much opinion of him -
George Penrose another of my old schoolfellows is also here, looking for
employment, but has as yet been unsuccessful - he is a very different young
man from S. Clibborn - When I visit Philadelphia I intend calling on
