Tramore 7th day.
Yes! My dear Emily
I was, when I wrote
to thy poor father
wholly ignorant of
your sorrows - Thou
mayst guess how
grieved and astonished
I was on receipt of
the card respecting
the dear
Margaret Manliff

Poor Jane! Poor Emily!
My mother's illness of
the same kind was a
deep trial and in it
I can fully sympathize
with her affectionate
daughters -
I am very anxious
about her very glad
that thy aunt Eliza
is with you - and Oh!
Emily thy heart felt
expression - I suppose

"it was needful" shows
thou art accepting it
aright - thou wilt be
prepared for that comfort
which no doubt
will be administered
by Him in His
own time - I know
thou hast been trained
in good things by my
dear cousin and play
fellow and that [deletion]it[/deletion] the
seed has fallen on
good ground - Truly

thy affectionate and
sympathizing cousin
M. G.
The last time I saw
the dear child was
with her mother in
the m. house yard
and her very serious &
sweet countenance struck
me - I thought she was
a great blessing to her.
My dear friend M.J.L.
wishes me to convey

a message of love and sympathy to you
including thy aunt E H.
