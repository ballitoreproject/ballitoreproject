I receiv'd my Dr Friends letter this [insertion]day[/insertion] as I left
home on seventhday to Join my Companion &c in sitting
with the families of this particular meeting altho I can do
very little myself I like sometimes to [insertion]be in[/insertion] the way of getting
a little good, & if it be ever so small & mean if one is favored
with a good appetite it relish's well I almost envy you
that is in the way of hearing & partaking of so many
heavenly expressions as no doubt are dropt from the
lips of our Beloved afflicted Friend who by all
accounts labours under a load of the disorder yet wonderfully
favoured with Calmness & resignation to the will
of him whom he faithfully served, but oh how I have
thought of [deletion]the[/deletion] his six little Children that is likely to
be left to mourn the loss of affect. tender Parents &
his friends will sensibly feel his loss as he was a very
Usefull friend, we were very Anxious for the return
of J. Shannan but alas the account was still afflicting

we cannot but mourn the loss of such a friend tho no
doubt but if he is remov'd it will be his great gain for
what can be more comfortable than [insertion]to[/insertion] be safely landed in
a mansion of Glory where the wicked do cease from troubling
& as Casper Clibburn intends going in the morning & returning
in the Evening I send this by him, JS. Beale is on his way
to the north, but my Dr Molly how does trouble go from
place to place in this land Dr A Pike we hear is now laid
up in a fever how affecting is that in her present situation
I shou'd think distressingly so, it may be truly said many
are the afflictions of the Righteous but it is the Lord alone
that can deliver out of all
I think it a singular favour you have such helps in this
trying time & that thy mother bears it so well - - our United
Dear loves to Dear Job if living & to all his attenders [insertion]thy Mother[/insertion] Molly
Hudson Abram. & family & to be sure to my Dear Molly & her
Wm. with little Betty - - be sure send a particular account [unclear]for[/unclear]
Cooper - I remain thy affect.
