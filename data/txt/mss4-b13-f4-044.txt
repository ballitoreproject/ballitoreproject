2d.. First-day. Treated with silent meetings: their
preparative meeting, at breaking up of the first,

Dined with Jane Winter &c: at the school in
Frenchay. 3d. Robt. Lovell, his wife & daughters
Deborah, Sarah, & Rachel took me with them in
a coach to their monthly meeting at Thornbury.
In the second meeting, the word to me seemed
to be, "Repent & do thy first works &c:" so I
endeavoured to be honest, & did not feel uneasy
thereat. 22 miles riding this day. 4th Dined
at Thos. Rutters, a little better than a mile from
this, a sweet little place: Thos. in town, so we
had not his company. 5th. Meeting-day, & a
