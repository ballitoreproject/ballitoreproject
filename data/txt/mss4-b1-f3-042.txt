P 110			R. S. to his Son
					Dublin 7th of Fifthmonth 1776.
		*** Religion, which is an acquaintance with God in spirit, is the noblest principle which man is capable of. But the activity and energy of it is not at manâ€™s command. We are to be quiet, passive, and not seek to stir up our Beloved till he please. Let us abide at home (in the house) till intelligence arrives that the Master is come, and calleth for us. Men, willing and running of themselves after the knowledge of religion, as they do after discoveries in natural science bewilder themselves, and effect nothing that is profitable. Patiently wait, and quietly hope, is the lesson we should learn. How dry and like ashes our minds are, when the flame of religion (I mean the active, present virtue of it) is extinct.
	Thou hast, my dear Abraham, a weighty charge devolved upon thy youthful shoulders. Thou hast great occasion for wisdom.
						I am, indeed,
							Thy affectionate father
								R. S.
