Rose & her daughter Betty
Rose. What's the matter, Betty, you look as
if you were frightened.
Betty. O, Mother, a terrible thing has happened, &
poor Anstis Cassidy is ruined for good & all.
Rose. O tell me [deletion]how it[/deletion] what it is
Betty. There's Mr. Nesbitt's place all in a blaze
They say all his fine horses are burnt to death,
& oh, Mother they say one of the fine little children
is burnt to death too.
Rose. Oh, Betty, don't say so.
Betty. And it was all by Anstis means they
say, but I could not well know how. Here's
Tommy. Were you out of the fire Tommy? Is any
thing saved?
Tommy. O yes, [insertion]but[/insertion] there is [deletion]not much[/deletion] [insertion]a great deal of[/insertion] mischief done
a stable is burnt & the fine turf house & all the
turf, but the house is safe, & the horses are got out
of the stable.
Rose. And the child, Tommy, O the child!
Tommy. There was no child near it.
Betty. They said one of the children & the horses were
burnt.
Tommy, Make yourselves easy, no child was hurt
nor so much as a dog lost its life. But you never
saw how poor Tim Cassidy worked, & what danger
he run into, Every one helped, but none like Tim.
& indeed no one had a better right
Rose. Why so.
Tommy. It was Anstis set the place a fire
with her nasty pipe, that she never lets out of
her mouth. She went [deletion]to the[/deletion] [insertion]for[/insertion] turf [deletion]herself[/deletion] & [deletion]I suppose[/deletion]
[insertion]a coal[/insertion] fell out of her pipe, [insertion]unknown to her[/insertion][deletion]but was just in the[/deletion]
[deletion]spot she was the presumed to have began, &[/deletion] the
turf being dry, & the weather dry it kindled, & in
two or three hours the fire flared out at the top
of the house through the thatch, & then poor Anstis
roared & screeched & cursed her pipe.
Rose. Well she might. Poor creature. I wish she may
leave off smoking now, but it is such a fashion that
people can hardly leave it off when they once have
got into it. O children, let this be a warning to you
never to touch a pipe.

I have a child
That's very mild
As ever yet was born
Her person's neat
And tight her feet
And toes without a corn.
2
Her fine blue eyes
None could despise
For her nose I cannot say
Tis cockd at end
Perhaps twill mend
Before her wedding day
3
From out her mouth
Come nought but truth
Since first she saw the light
Tis pretty too
There are but few
That can at all come night
