8th. Papa, Polly and I went to meeting
in the covered car, as the old carriage
is [deletion]y[/deletion]under the [underline]doctor's[/underline] care in town
it being in rather a mutilated

place some time or other if nothing
prevents, next fifth day I believe
saw Emmy there - paid another
visit to Grandmama with
whom we left Uncle R and brought

and Charlie dined there, so we had
a comparatively small number [unclear][/unclear]
