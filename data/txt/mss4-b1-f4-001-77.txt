It is strikingly remarkable, of how singular and manifold service
one person is, whose good natural understanding is imbued with
Divine wisdom, and who, in all humility and devotedness, goes
on in simplicity, doing the great Master's will. How great then
must be use, and how powerful the effect, when many such
are combined together, assisting and encouraging one another,
and assisted and encouraged by the Head of the church. So
that every individual should look well to themselves, lest their
want of coming properly forward should not only be to their
own great loss, but to the impoverishing and debilitating of
the general effort for promoting the common cause. I hear that
account has been received of the release of our dear friend W.M.
from this warfare **. Now, my dear M. with the one heart of
two parents affectionately solicitous for thy happy release, in
due season, from every burden, and that all sorrows may, in the
Lord's time, be changed into joy, I bid thee most tenderly and
cordially farewell.
R. S.
