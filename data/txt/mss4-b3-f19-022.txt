My dear Uncle,


        I cannot express how much I am obliged by thy kind favour of 26th ultimate: should have replied sooner if I could have procured a Frank, of which being disappointed shall no longer defer informing thee that the disagreeable affair, which occasioned my last, will now I hope be buried in oblivionI should not have been so hasty in acquainting thee with what I might know would give thee concern, but that I had been told another person threatened to write to thee on the subject; & I supposed he would not be inclined to mention every particular leading circumstance: His intention of writing I thought did not promise that the affair would be likely to blow over soon, which induced me to lay it before thee without exaggerationThe day after I wrote A Balfour came to me, & informed me that WP denied his hearing me refuse to comply with his desire in any other but the most abrupt manner or that he at that time knew of my motive for refusing which perhaps in the heat of passion he might have forgot however Archy himself was witness of the terms I made use of & did me the justice to declare it to himhe also told me that WP never suspected me of opening the letter in question but imagined I might have given another youngman [sic] an opportunity of doing it who might he suspected have a curiosity of prying into the Contents for reasons which perhaps might not be prudent for me to explain except I had an opportunity of doing it viv voce in answer to that I alledged that I had repeatedly declared to him & his wife that the Letter had not been out of my possession from the time I left the Post Office & that I was totally ignorant of its being opened by any onewhich AB knew to be the caseHe asked me if I was willing to continue until the Accounts were properly settled I answered in the affirmative which he approved of but blamed me for not informing WP of my resolution about the Letters at a proper time which might have caused an explanation of their scrutinythe matter was they were cautious of hurting the other young mans [sic] delicacy in case he should come to know on whom their suspicions fell which he shall never know from me.
        When George Penrose came to town he blamed his Nephew for what he had done & sent me a Message to inform me that his conduct through the whole affair met with his disapprobation & that he would be sorry to part with me, that he had a great regard for me on my Friends account & wished a reconciliation might take place; but at the same time was solicitous I should make some concessions [obscured by seal] apprehended it would hurt his Nephews [sic] consequence to take the first step, to which I had no objection so far as this [thus?] to assure him my refusal was not occasioned by any disrespect & that if I had expressed an unwillingness to go for the letters before all uneasiness might have been prevented Every thing runs on smoothly now in the usual Channel & will I hope continue soPlease present me with affection to all at home I hope to have the pleasure of seeing my Friends in Ballitore during the course of the ensuing Spring or Summer. Please let Cousin Abraham know I am fully sensible of his kindness in writing to me as he has done
        I am         Dear Uncle
                thy dutiful Nephew
                        William Rayner
