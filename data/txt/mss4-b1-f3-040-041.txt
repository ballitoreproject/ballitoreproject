101. 			R. S. to his Daughter Margaret
					Ballitore 24th of Firstmonth 1773
		*** Mayst thou, dear Child, be preserved in simplicity and nothingness of self; in humility and lowliness of mind, seeking diligently after, and waiting steadily for the inward experience of that which unmixedly [sic] good. This ishte way to be helped along, from day to day, throâ€™ one difficulty and proving after another, to the end of our wearisome pilgrimage; having, [sic] recourse like the hunted hart, to the brook by the way, when pressed by our spiritual enemies. By this, my dear Child, the predecessors in our family, who lived in the truth, were enabled to wade through their afflictions, and knew that overcoming which entitles to the glorious eternal rewards. Many are the favours which thou, my dear Daughter, hast received at the hand of the great Giver. What need I enumerate any of them? thy grateful heart is sensible of them. May thy branches, weighted down with humility, gratitude, and all fruits of the spirit, bend towards the root which sustains every tree of righteousness, and from which its sap and life is supplied and derived. By humility and lowliness of mind, many temptations are avoided, and incumbrances escaped. It is a safe & quiet habitation, into which the devil cannot enter; and his emissaries view the dwelling with derision, and turn from it with contempt. So the heavenly guest has more free admittance, and uninterrupted abode; and the bread eaten in secret administers invisible but effectual support.
I am, dear Margar, 		Thy affectionate father		R. S.
