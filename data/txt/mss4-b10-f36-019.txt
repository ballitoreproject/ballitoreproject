My dear Eliza
I have just heard of George Henry being
in town and [insertion]that[/insertion] thou wilt expect to hear from
us by him, Lucy desires me to write & tell thee
every thing & I am sure I have but little to
tell. this is third day evening, I came in
to town yesterday morning with Arthur on
Donovans car, I did not feel comfortable at
first leaving my Mother but she made me
go in and said there was no fear of her at
all, she had three servants to wait on her &
wanted no one to stay with her She is to be
in tomorrow I had a note from her to day by
Manliff who was in town, & she says she is getting
on well. I have but little news to tell thee, the
meeting is going on as usual we have no English
friends this time (women I mean) there
are three men ministers, William Rickman
Richard Burlington & Joseph Hopkins, I have
not seen them yet not being at meeting on first
day. a number of people are complaining of
this cold, there are several laid up at Bridge st.

amongst the rest Cousin Betsy & Henry Allen,
Lucy has just given me particular directions to
tell thee how we are all situated here, Frank
has got a cold his eyes & nose are running as hard
as they can, so that he is obliged to confine himself
to the house and cannot go out to seek bachelors
for us. I have not been any where yet except
at Nicholas St to dinner to day. Joseph is
in town from Clonmell & brought no letter for
thee from Mary. I told thee in my last which
I suppose thou got this morning that they all
arrived at Mary street on first day, Manliff would
not go in the morning but went in to dinner & second
meeting, thy staid tea & came home about nine
Arthur & I staid at home to mind the children, thou
may think what a long day we had when I tell thee
that we breakfasted at half past seven, and yet it
did not feel lonesome. Lucy had a note from thee
this morning which I read & I do not think thou
need have been so uneasy about not hearing quite
so soon as usual, Lucy's having written to thee
last week delayed my doing so, we are all well
except for Frank's cold. Sally Malone says she is

obliged for thy note and desires her love and she
hopes to answer it soon, I have just heard from
Bridge Street that Henry Allen is up & down stairs
likewise Cousin Betsy, so that the illness whatever
it is does not last long... I am sorry to hear thou
hast not been so well these two or three days
back thou had too much excitement last
week & too much exertion. I do intreat of thee
to nurse thyself this week, & do not think of
coming home untill our bustle if we have
any is quite over, my Mother has not
yet got any answer from the [unclear]Lunells[/unclear]
I wish it was decided one way or other
perhaps the next time I write I may have more
to tell thee about it. Emmy is well and sometimes
looks pleasant enough but the poor little thing
is troubled with her teeth still, she is growing
quite brown & sunburnt, she is to be in town tomorrow
with my Mother, and pay her papa
& Mama a visit. I forgot to mention Aunt Jane
being very poorly with a bad headache, so thou sees
there are plenty of complainers. thou hast doubtless
heard ere this of Mary Rigby's having a [underline]son[/underline] so I
suppose there is great rejoicing on that account

Frank & Lucy both desire their loves, the former
says that he is not in a fit state to write a letter
to a young woman and says that he met H Bewley
in the bank and that he made a pretty little speech
the purport of which was that he considered it was
to Betsy Barrington he [deletion][/deletion] [insertion]was indebted for[/insertion] the [underline]pleasure[/underline] of thy
acquaintance," Lucy says that I have written
instead of her, and that thou wilt consider it as
such, and now farewell hoping soon to hear
from thee with dear love I am thy affcte. Sister
Selina

F W is still in his situation but does not seem in
good spirits, Sam I hear is come back. I was quite surprised
to see Mary Shackleton who gave me a very good account
of thy looks which I am sorry to find can be so little depended
on, it is time to close I may lay it by untill
tomorrow & can add something more then, if I have it,
Sally says she has not found out where G Henry stops &
that she does not know whether she can do so or not this
is scarce worth the postage but perhaps there would be an
opportunity.
4th= day morning A wet unpleasant day which I am
afraid will prevent my Mother coming in. I believe I
must send it by post as I cannot find out where G H stops
or whether he is going to day.
