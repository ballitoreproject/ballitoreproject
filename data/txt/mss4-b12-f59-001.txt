I concur with thee in sentiments that bodily separation
is of little significance, when we sensibly feel the
heavenly fellowship of the gospel to unite our spirits, a blessing
which I coud earnestly desire I might more frequently
witness with my dear friends at a distance, but ala[deletion]s[/deletion]s!
I have sometimes been permitted to sink so low as almost
to lose this evidence of my being passed from death to
life, when I cou'd not say I loved the breth[deletion]e[/deletion]r[insertion]e[/insertion]n in a renewed
sense of this sacred unity; & even at this time I dare
not profess abundantly; yet think the renewal of our
acquaintance has been a means to stamp the impressions
of our former friendship deeper on my mind, having
with thankfulness to believe on thy behalf, that the
time of our abs[deletion]c[/deletion]ence has been employed to some advantage.
I woud not have thee think that I write this to pleas[insertion]e[/insertion],
the natural part; no, far be it from me to offer the in[deletion]s[/deletion][insertion]c[/insertion]ense
of flattery, or even pain my friends with a recital
of their excellencies: true friendship needs no such weak
supports; but is rather pleased with judicious reproofs: but
I think I found freedom to say so much for thy encouragement,
being convinced thy steppings are solemn, & as in
the deeps, where thou art led to try & examine thy standing
& advances in the truth, & in the extremity of
poverty mayest be ready yet to conclude thou gettest not
a step forward, but rather declinest from that which
was

was once thy life. My dear friend, it is in my heart to bid
thee stand upon thy feet & look upward; for almighty help
will be administred adequate to thy present exigency;
we sometimes are mistaken in our wants, we think we
want divine refreshment, when perhaps 'tis necessary
we shou'd at that time be convinced how poor & destitute
of the enjoyment[deletion]s[/deletion] of every good we are without it: & this is
[deletion]a[/deletion][insertion]e[/insertion]ffected by a deprivation of th[deletion]eir[/deletion][insertion]is[/insertion] heavenly consolation
as we abide steady, in humble dependance, this bread of
adversity is made profitable; it strengthens the root, tho'
it does not seem to appear in the branches; & what need is
there in our church of such as [insertion]are[/insertion] strong & sound in the root,
that be[deletion]e[/deletion]ing deeply grounded are able to bear the shocks
which may be given them by backslider[deletion]er[/deletion][insertion]s[/insertion], high professors
& libertine spirits, oh! how ha[deletion]ve[/deletion][insertion]th[/insertion] my soul mourned in the
consideration of the light chaffy spirit, which appears even
amongst the elders of my people; yea, it has assumed
the highest seat, and appearance, being dis[insertion]c[/insertion]overable in some
thing that bears the name of ministry; but I have said in
the secret of my soul, they know not what it is to be emptied,
& under the consideration of it, have almost been made to
rejoice in poverty, and be united to suff[insertion]e[/insertion]rings of spirit.
