19th.. The Crearys and Pattons spent last
evening with us - We played two games
of Schimmelle which occupied most of
the interval between tea and supper
This morning after breakfast we had
a game at the air gun, and then we
girls drove over to see Rachel Haughton
and Eliza Bell. She has a beautiful
garden, such nice flowers. It was a
pity we did not go to the Haughtons
the other evening, they had invited several
people to meet us.
20th.. Went to meeting this morning,
met there the usual people. On
our return we strolled about in
the garden eat gooseberries &c &c - If
to- morrow be fine we all intend going
to Muckamore -

a pleasant drive we had, tho' I cann[unclear]ot[/unclear]
