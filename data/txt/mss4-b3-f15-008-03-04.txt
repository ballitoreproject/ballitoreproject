Ballitore: 10th of 3rd month 1770

Dear friend,
	++++ It will doubtless be very lonesome for thee to be separated so long & so often ^far^ from thy husband, & particular circumstances sometimes attending give an additional gloom to the prospect: but there is a privilege, there is an advantage which the Lords children enjoy above the children of this world. If these [?] partakes not with these in their pleasures, yet they have substantial enjoyments which the world knows not of. When the husband & wife are united in spirit, & their spirit is a little seasoned with the virtue of Truth, how sweet & comfortable is their union & communing together! Separated in body yet present in spirit; no local distance, nor external circumstance can divide their fellowship & communion as long as they seek after & live in the life, which is the feeder & nourisher of it. May this be the happy experience, as well as the diligent seeking of us all, for really in this world is trouble, disappointment & deceit; & it is our best wisdom with all industry of spirit, to endeavour to insure a possession in an inheritance, a glorious inheritance, which remains to the people of God for ever. +++

	Our dear love attends thee & thy husband wherever he is & we heartily wish his preservation & the safe custody of Divine Providence to restore him to thee safe & sound.
	I am with true respect,
		thy affectionate friend
			Richard Shackleton
