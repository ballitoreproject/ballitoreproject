owing I believe to carelessness -
8th.. Seventh day - and fine at [unclear]last[/unclear].
We walked to the Dagh before dinner,
I quite forgot to say Uncle Manliff
breakfasted with us. He and Papa
went afterwards - Papa to town &
back again in the evening. Charlie
came out to tea - and Thos Henry
White came out with Papa -
9th. Georgina and I went to meeting
accompanied as far as Cabinteely
by Philip - We were to have brought
back Uncle Richard who however
said he could not come -
We called at Glendruid and saw
Mr Gough and Uncle Manliffe -
Philip we were surprised to find
there still, so he returned with
us - We came for variety the Cherrywood
road - Gabe Fisher dined with
us - poor fellow he did not seem
very well in the evening - &
went away before we had finished
