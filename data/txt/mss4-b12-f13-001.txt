SIR,
IN consequence of the high price of Provisions
and the extreme distress of the POOR of this Town and
Neighbourhood, there have been Meetings convened, in which it

it appears that there are upwards of 1,300 individuals who require

of the Committee.
And have the Honor to be
Your most Obedient Servant
