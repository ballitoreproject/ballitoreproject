From the same to the same
									    Ballitore: 23/7 month 1778
My dear Cousin,
	I am favoured with thine of 15th, the contents were read to my ^dear^ sister Carleton, & no doubt were pleasing to her, particularly that part where thou so feelingly mentions your ancient friendship, & the fresh reviving of it in thy mind from a sympathy with her sufferings. Her sufferings have been long & various indeed, her bodily affliction often great, but she is now I hope happily & mercifully released out of them all. ++ She drew her last breath yesterday between 10 & 11 oclock in the forenoon to appearance very quietly, without stirring I believe hand or foot. She had past the night with tolerable composure, but altered early in the morning, & said very little to any of us. She was an honest, upright, downright woman, of great sincerity & steady friendship, more in substance than in show  she hated evil ways, & had a great dislike to evil persons who were deaf to reproof & advice. She had liberal sentiments, & an open-heartedness & generosity superior to her income. Her charity & compassion were very great & extensive considering her situation in life  her house was much resorted to by the poor, who received from her both pity, skillful advice & medicine  Her loss will be greatly felt hereabouts  she made no ^parade nor^ ostentation of her acts of benevolence  she was well acquainted with human nature, & knew the worthlessness (comparatively speaking) of many that she relieved  but this did not discourage her from doing all the good that was in the power of her hand to do. My obligations & those of my children to her are great & numerous  She watched with a sharp, attentive eye for my interest & the welfare of my children, & I believe was made a help & a blessing in the hand of Providence to them. She is gone, & we have lost that temporary stay. My wife & children bear this dispensation I hope with proper & becoming resignation, & I humbly hope it will be sanctified to us all, that whatever wind blows on the spices, whether the unpleasant (though perhaps profitable) north-wind, or the more grateful, welcome south, they may flow out as a sweet savour to the great Husbandman, who has graciously condescended to cultivate the garden. ++
								thy truly affectionate kinsman
