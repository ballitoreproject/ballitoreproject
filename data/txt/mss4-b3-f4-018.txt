Ketley 4th month 19th 1786

My dear Uncle

	I received an acceptable letter from thee a few weeks ago which I intended to have brought with me for reperusal, but on examining my papers I find a wrong one put up which disables me from entering into the particulars of it & methodically renewing the letter now that my affectionate remembrance ^of thee & thine^ is renewed which however if there is nothing ^else^ will be the spirit of this communication  It was pleasant to find that I retained a place in thy best solicitude & care & I greatly desire that by a watchful attention to the turnings of the divine Hand the fatherly regard of some I greatly esteem may not be removed from me knowing that I stand in need of their counsel; though to get deep enough to the true spring of it ^instruction^ in ourselves is the foundation of all right unity & fellowship. We have often I mean my dear companions R.G., G.D. & myself felt the glow of true-love therein which though not much expressed to themselves is nevertheless a living spark in (I trust) all our breasts, & many waters cannot quench this love nor can long separation remove those epistles which are written by the finger thereof & in which there is sometimes liberty allowed for the spirit to meditate in with a degree of strengthening consolation, especially when by the clearness of the characters we find one another as fellow pilgrims travelling after the resurrection of pure life & making steady advances towards that city which hath foundations  upon this object I sometimes fix my eye with renewed resolutions through holy help ^to^ press forward through the difficulties of the present scene & to count all things but as dross & as dung that I may win Christ & be found in ^him^ not having my own righteousness but the righteousness of faith in Christ, if thereby I may attain the resurrection of his power, the fellowship of his sufferings & be made conformable to his death  the spirit is willing thus to endure, but the flesh & its inherent propensity to ease creates a warfare wherein I sometimes fear the natural & best life will entirely fall  the present 
turn out with my beloved friend R.G. has been a fresh trial, ^the^ uprightness of my desire after dedication  after returning from your Land I earnestly sought quietude & obscurity to have settled down a while amongst my valueable [sic] connexions & enjoyed their society, or what is still preferable the benefits of solitude, but the reward of peace was not the attendance of these prospects nor did the cloud appear to rest upon my tabernacle  the words time is short were deeply inscribed upon my heart; so that one thing or other bid me take a few more steps in the tribulated path of gospel obedience & accordingly set forward after our quarter meeting which was the last week in the last month with our mutually dear & beloved R. Jones to Ackworth where we staid over 1st day & from thence to Manchester & so directly by for Cheshire where we attended all the meetings, went to their monthly meeting at Warrington where we had the opportunity of seeing a second time our honoured friend & mother in Israel J. Taylor  she appears in her usual liveliness of spirit & better in health than for some time past so that there is some reason to hope that she may get to the yearly meeting in London where her company & baptized spirit is greatly to be desired  I hope that women friends in general will now look more towards London than has yet been the case & that our sisters in Ireland will not be backward in giving their strength & right zeal for the carrying on of the important work ^now^ committed to the care of women friends
	After leaving Cheshire we came by way of Leek to this place from whence after visitting [sic] the old Dale we propose going to Shrewsbury hoping there to be favoured with sight whether to turn into Wales or take a line of meetings through Worcestershire Herefordshire &c to Cardiff where the Welch yearly meeting is to be held this year & falls the 9th of next month Bristol yearly meeting beginning the 1st day following 
The northern yearly meeting at Blackburn in Lancashire this week, G Dillwyn, William Matthew, M. Jenkins, my Mother Richard & Patience Chester & many other strangers are we supposed there  George has been a few weeks in Yorkshire he joined Rebecca & Mother in a visit to the families at York & Rebecca & C. [?] Hustler at Leeds & where he turns, from the [seal torn away] yearly meeting I dont know  his Sally we [obscured by seal] [seal torn away] him there  she has been a long time with [obscured by seal] [seal torn away] at Kendall & we rather expect will go [obscured by seal] of them to London, but you perhaps know more than we as her attachment to Ballitore will often urge ^her^ I suppose to pay epistolary visits to it  John Pemberton was at our quarterly meeting & went northward from thence with an eye fixed upon what he apprehends ^his work^ in Scotland & is likely to be joined by Thomas Cash of which many of his friends are pleased, hoping that Thomas feeling sympathizing mind will blunt the sharpness of John [sic] trials & alleviate some of his discouragements  there is little or no prospect of their being at the yearly meeting  Dear Thomas ^Ross^ got happily translated at last, his illness was one continued scene of instruction because his spirit was wonderfully replenished with divine ^virtues^ & bore fruit to the advantage of most that attended him  many of his expressions are preserved & a considerable part of them inserted in a testimony drawn up by York monthly meeting concerning him.
Perhaps thou mayst have heard that we have given up our house at Foston & are at present unsettled as to any place of abode  My Husband came with us for about a week & returned with William Rotch [?] & son from Nantucket to Ackworth where & at Castleford he was likely to make a little stay we are very desirous of being righty directed as to fixing upon another habitation whether in England or Ireland or what part of either  I exceedingly dread being out 
of our right place through the influence of inclination, a false prejudice or prepossession & much desire that we may get deep enough to understand the directions of pure wisdom
I have had an account since I left home of Sister Maria being delivered of another Daughter, the third Child, Brother Johns have two a Boy & a Girl  they & the rest of families were in usual health as was our dear friends D & E Priestman & friends in general  Perhaps thou hast hear that Richard Routh has been very ill in a fever of the nervous & intermitting kind & on that account Patty has been sent for from her Companion in London who I expect is by this time joined by Cousin J. Middleton who has long had a prospect of visitting the families of friends at Tottenham who its [illegible] they may set about it before the yearly meeting where I hope to see thee and some of thine & to all is my affectionate salutation & I am myself thy poor but truly affectionate friend & kinswoman S. R. Grubb

22d as I seal this at Coalbrook dale I have an opportunity of telling thee that this family retain an affectionate remembrance of thee & a great number of them desire me to insert their love as does my dear friend R. Jones
