which I expended some 400 more in improvements, but all was eventually
lost by a defect in the Individuals title from whom I purchased. I also
engaged is Bussinees, as a sleeping Partner, the one who was [underline]awake[/underline], [underline]walked[/underline]
off and left me to settle the debts of the Establishment, what escaped the
the grasp of unfairness, imprudence and folly besewed, (but not [underline]crime[/underline]
as I have heard it was reported in Ireland some years ago) then came that
devasting element Fire - and left me houseless, clothesless, Breadless
Money-less, in fact naked as the day I was born - since then I have had
nothing to depend on save my own exertions, these though abundantly able to
keep my every needed want supplied were for a series of years (through which I suffered
much hardship and my family [unclear]maid[/unclear]. of but little avail owing to bad health, and
more particularly to a deep depression of mind, that made me indifferent about exercising
the abilities I possessed - so it went up to-day - tommorrow down, hours of Joy were
followed by months of sorrow, poverty followed riches, and devoured them, and want
of a little means, now to set me going has kept me down ever since, but great reason have
I to thank God - since ever I have set my whole heart to serve him He has done more than I deserved
this has been more particularly exemplified not only to myself but to others in the past year or two -
No wealth have I in flocks and herds
No corn nor wine in store -
No Sychophants those flattering birds
That harvest the Golden ore -
Yet I have life and I have health
These doth my bosom move -
To praise the Fountain of my wealth
So praise the fountain of my wealth
I'm rich in Faith and Love!
This earth has ever been to me
A world of strife and care
Its brightest sky, its sunniest sea
Were but a tempting snare!
E'en now full many a darksome hour
Are mine! - yet still I prove
Tho' poor in purse - tho' weak in power
I'm rich in Faith and Love! -
I may not boast what I have done
Or what I could endure -
Sufficient this - to rest upon
[underline]His[/underline] - promises are [underline]sure[/underline]! -
Whoever [underline]seeks[/underline], shall surely [underline]find[/underline]
Who [underline]trusts[/underline] - his power may prove -
The poorest I - of my poor kind
Am rich in Faith and Love!
Rude are the gales and rough the shocks
The Pilgrim's vessel bears
Our smiles to-day - to-morrow mocks
Or turns to scalding tears! -
Yet still triumphant on I tread
My hopes are placed above
[underline]Tho' I may want my daily bread[/underline]
[underline]I'm Rich in Faith and Love![/underline]
God, grant me Grace and sweet content
My humble lot to bear
Whilst I the Pilgrim's banishment
Must still with others share! -
With firm resolve may I contend
Each obstacle remove -
Nor mourn the the loss of wealth or friend
[underline]Whilst rich in Faith and Love![/underline] -
Then were I to fill a dozen sheets I could not tell
thee more or in a better form how I feel and am
at present, than I have done in the above lines, I
said before I am more at ease in Poetry than Prose-
I am engaged in Leading a Day School, four
miles from where I live, with a Salary of £ 50
p year - twenty Five of which is paid by Goverment,
the remainder by the parents. I did not always
get so much, nor is nor is there another in the whole
Province I believe who is in receipt of the

same amount - however, I have not room to enter into particulars neither wouldst thou
care much about them - suffice it to say I began with 10 or 12 scholars and £ 27.10s p year,
I now have upwards of 70 children and £50 p year - so much for God's blessing on my
endeavours - - Was it William Wright of Coole bawn in the Co Wexford thou mentioned
as being home lately - if so - I have not met with him, though I believe we have
been very near one another in our different peregrinations, as I heard of him different
times - I wish if ever thou should write to me again, and that I hope may be
very soon, thou wouldst if possible inform of Samuel Gamble's whereabouts -
in Canada - Will thou give my dear and kind Love to Martha in whose name or
at whose request thou wrote, why could she not write to me herself, - how delighted
I would be to get a line from her, that day would be a "white one" in my Life -
What is become of her two Sisters I remember their persons but forget their names, -
Dear Love to all of thine own household - as if personally named, and to any
others who may ask after the Absent One - may my Heavenly Father bless thee my
Cousin - and Jacob's God be thy counsellor and guide is the earnest prayer of thy
Kinsman & friend Frederick Wright - .
