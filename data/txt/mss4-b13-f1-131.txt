129 breakfast to Jemmy Moore’s, where, after breakfast, we had a little sitting, of wch. I was thankful; Hannah Grubb (Benjm.) was encouraged to press forward. Sarah & I in our little Cab: & our old friend John Gilmer riding with us, went to Anner-mills, there, after dinner, Sarah has to speak to the sweet young people present. After tea came home, & had some of Charles Cootes company to my satisfaction, I call’d this evening to see Mary Higgison, who looks rather delicate. On 1st day morning I told Sarah I had been dreaming of seeing Dorcas Fitzgerald dying, & that it had occur’d to me that perhaps it was Sarah’s Will was to die. - she then told me she believed she must go for Limerick &c:, I felt no disappointment or uneasiness on hearing this, only that I pity her, & wish to be more & more rightly qualified to enter into right sympathy with her. 24th Third-day morn
