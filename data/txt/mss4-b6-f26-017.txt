My dear friend,
As I apprehend something I said this
evening might have given thee uneasiness, I think
I cant do less than endeavour to explain myself
even if it was for nothing but to ease my own
mind, I cant but accuse myself of ingratitude
after thou being so kind as to desire my company,
& I agreeably partaking of the favour
of thine, to say I was rather angry with myself
for spending the evening in the manner I
did, probably I thought at that time I might
have spent it better, that I ought have 
sought out some solid friends where it would
be likely to have an opportunity; but since
there is a time for all things; however
I wish I may never spend an evening
worse than I did this; so I think I may say
I

I am really sorry for my incivility, & expect
thou wilt excuse me. I thought I could not
be easy without mentioning this, farewell
Wm. Leadbeater.
