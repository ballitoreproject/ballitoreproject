Belfast Lough
July 26th
[1855]
My dear Mamma
I cannot write
more at present than
to say that we are here
still, but if the wind
will answer us, we
intend to leave this

to-morrow, and we
are after getting both
your & Mary's letter
& it was a great comfort
to hear you were all
well, will you write
a line to Campbeltown
(ask Arthur how it is
spelled) as well as to
Gourock both in Scotland
as we dont know yet
which way will answer
the wind best as yet-
with dear love in
dreadful haste your
much attached
MJB
