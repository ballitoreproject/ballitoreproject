My dear Cousin
I knew not how to set about replying
to thy pathetick remonstrance before the accomplishment
of my intentions as I supposed the only
reply I could give would not be agreeable:
I therefore judged it better to be silent for a while.
The step I have taken was I considered then unavoidable
& were it still to do I must confess
my sentiments are the same - Some of the
consequences I must ever regret the being secluded
from my loved Ballitore connexions - It is not
now necessary for me to explain some weighty
motives, which (joined with my own wishes)
determined me to act as I have done, suffice
it to say I had some, which to me were convincing.
The matter was hurried on by a nonsensical
anonymous letter addressed to Mary Watson
of which she said she supposed me the author
in

informing her in a circumstantial manner when
& how I was married, & the plan I meant to pursue
afterwards - conveying also some hints calculated to
injure my character with my employers as if
I was in the practice of defrauding them which
fortunately had no weight with them - I may say
there was not a word of truth in the whole of
the curious production - on being questioned I
thought it best to save trouble & be candid &
having interest enough to prevail on the young
woman & her parents to bring the affair to an
issue six months sooner than was at first intended
I thought it the most effectual method to stop
folks' mouths - The family rank rather high
in the mechanical line & would if there was sufficiency
of employment become wealthy as they
are industrious & moderate in their expenses - I
considered them many times ill treated & perhaps
on

on that account interested myself the more in their
welfare. They were originally encouraged to come
from Dublin to assist at the Glass Manufactory
staid here a considerable time & found themselves
under the necessity of returning. Their services
here were so valuable as to induce the principal
to seek a personal interview in Dublin & prevail on them
to come again to Waterford - The young womans charms
were now approaching to maturity - I therefore for prudential
reasons avoided her as much as possible
& although lodging under the same roof for twelve months
previous to the family's being once more unsettled
I did not spend half an hour at any time in her
company - The consequence of remaining any longer
as they were now treated should be their being completely
impoverished - The Father went to Cork to try his
fortune & finding encouragement was to be followed
by the remainder of his family as soon as convenient.
The daughter went next - the parting was sorrowful
& some expressions dropped which explained our feelings
a correspondence ensued which left no doubt of

of our mutual inclination - It was useless to oppose
any longer what seemed inevitable - their return was
therefore contrived which was very much to their
disadvantage - in that their interest was sacrificed
to my convenience although the connexion
was not desired by the parents - nor desirable
by any means - I have been more explicit in
this detail with thee than I feel myself inclined
to be with any other person from the affectionate
intimacy which has always subsisted between us
which I hope will not now be dissolved.
I was pleased to hear my Aunt was well
enough to be at the Meeting of Dublin
Please present my love to her & the rest of the
family - I am thy sincerely affectionate.
