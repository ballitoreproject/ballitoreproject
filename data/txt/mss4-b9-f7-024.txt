Dublin Oct 14th 1828
My dear Elzabeth
I rc.d yours of the 12th
sent with half notes for 12 pound- 10S- 0d and since
have got remaining halves of the same.
your quickness in remitting [deletion]Sarah[/deletion] I
took to be a hint to me for not sending
to you sooner money due you as Executrix
which I have had for some
time in my hands. viz
£ s d
McManus year Acct 27.. 13.. 10 1/2
Balance of Jms Wright acct - [underline]8.. 11. 9[/underline]
36.. 5.. 7 1/2
less the balance of your act
with me as furnished [underline]1.. 10- 11/ 1/2[/underline]
due E L - 34,, 14,, 8
For which I now enclose an order on
Eben for £7 ..3s..2d and bank notes 28.. 10 0
with 1/11 in silver. This remittance closes
our acct for the present and I will thank
you to acknowledge receipt of same when
opportunity offers. Your [unclear]leaves[/unclear] and Lydia
are gone to London and I expect by this time
are excited and in possession of Thos Fisher

I have written to Edw [unclear]McEvoy[/unclear]. If he
should call on you ask him to shew
you my letter which will explains why
he calls. I understood the Widow [unclear]Laidler[/unclear]
was a yearly tenant and [unclear]repaired[/unclear] her
our houses which I believe is the fact.
farewell your affectionate
brother
