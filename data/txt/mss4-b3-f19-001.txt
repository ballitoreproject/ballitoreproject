For Richard Shackleton


Ballitore; 29th/4th month 1779.


Dear Uncle,


        This I hope will find you all well, & not a little pleased at the agreeable change of the weather; I wish it may continue to your satisfaction until you return. Coote seems bravely to-day, & sprightlier than usual; he eat his bit with a good appetite: a few such days would I fancy bring him to his spirits & strength [? paper torn]
Pray tell my cousin Aby that some pepper is wanting for the use of the house, & that Polly requests him to get her some franks; he knows the direction she says. This letter must be very short, however it is a satisfaction that it contains no disagreeable intelligence: be assured no care shall be wanting in the discharge of our important trust.
        We all join in love & duty where proper.
                I am, Dear Uncle,
                        thy dutiful & affectionate
                                W. Rayner.


I write on the frank as I could not get it to hold any more. If I thought I deserved it I would request thee to write to me; a favour I never yet had to boast of.
