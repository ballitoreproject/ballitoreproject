The evening was spent rather
pleasantly - we had a game at
proverbs which was lively enough -
and a few songs from some of
the gentlemen then supper which was
laid out on a table below in the
parlour - as there was not room
for all, none of us sat down -
which seemed to me a very good
plan - This important business
did not occupy us long - and the
ladies retired to the drawing room
again leaving the gentlemen - the
rest of the supper - &c &c &c -
As soon as the car came I took
my departure and had a lonely
but pleasant drive home - The
moon was shining brightly the whole
time. 12Â¼ 1/4 O'clock when I arrived here
25 Thursday [unclear]Inf early to get the
most churning into hands and
had the satisfaction of having
it accomplished in less than an hour
