My dear friend
You are [insertion]not[/insertion] ready to condemn hastily or
you might with good reason have said
I and & my favours are soon forgotten,
so little did I turn to think of you
Since I left you with my pockets full
of lore- which, having now committed to
my brain, I send, as agreed upon, to
Sarah for you with many thanks-
you will find them not much the worse
for the wear, although I assure you,
they have have [deletion]have[/deletion] been well read - The
same pen, but for its [underline]calculating[/underline] operations
in which it is at present engaged
might have been amusing and instructing
society and earning for [insertion]itself[/insertion] [deletion]himself[/deletion] a name
something like the "great unknown"
Mary Leadbeater
Ballitore

The writer has certainly a haply descriptive
genius, he seems to Know that
even Fancy herself must be carefully
attired - that a fruitful imagination
must have a copious & admired
expression - The seed certainly seems
to have been Sown in its native Soil
but being treated as an exotic it will
after some attempts to live, at length
decay - Ease and commensurate
affluence are necessary to the production
of talent, and all we can
say is, that where these are not, [unclear]genius[/unclear]
must be Sacrified -
I had long intended writing to Richard
in answer to a letter from him a good
while back, but one thing or another
has, as yet, prevented; but he may
soon expect to hear from me.
Let none of my friends in your neighbourhood
pass you without remembering
me
very kindly to them - you need except none
and if you should chance to see
George's Father in Law, be particular
in mentioning me to him as to one [deletion]for[/deletion]
whom I very particularly esteem, tho'
short a time I had the pleasure of
Knowing him - not mentioning names
will surely not give offence - I have
so many friends in Ballitore, they
are too numerous to go through -
Believe me, with best wished to all in
your house - Wm. Sally, Elizabeth &c,
in which Geogina & Girls unite, to remain
yrs most Sincerely
Peter North
Lydia & family were well
I hope, when you last heard
