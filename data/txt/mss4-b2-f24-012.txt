Clonmel 28th of 10th month 1780

My dear Father

	I am in debt to thee for thy two very kind, very comfortable, & very entertaining letters one of 24th & the other 27th instant, in the first you were waiting the day to unite the two lovers together, & in the next the affair was concluded, may it be a happy, permanently happy conclusion is my earnest wish. I am now got a little farther into the cares attending the married state, & find in my own experience the Apostles [sic] words verified Such shall have trouble in the flesh however this trouble is good for us poor Mortals, as it helps to put us out of conceit with this World, & of course turns our attention towards another where trouble is at an end. My Children are again pretty well, Richard being cross one night alarmed me much as I feared all was not over, & I anxiously watched him without taking rest myself until morning, about 5 oclock w^h^en I closed my weary eyes & dreamed I was at Ballitore, & saw my Brothers fine children, I got cold that night, my throat is sore, but I ^hope^ it will not be long so. Sam went for Waterford this day, it would have been pleasing to him to have attended the marriage, but quite inconvenient, the change of these Combers [?] required his presence at home, & the hurry of making up Pork also required his attention, so that business would be liable to suffer much by his absence both at the wedding & Dublin meeting, I hope he will struggle to attend the latter, & meet you & our Brother & sister Chandlee there: my Father, Mother & Aunt Malcomson were at our house the day I received thy first letter, I read part of it for the intertainment [sic] of our company, which was very acceptable, & helped to enliven us, for we really want some animation sometimes, being as thou justly describes us, immersed in business, domestick cares, peevish & complaining I mean my own family only. I heard of our friend Huttons [?] union. I wish them satisfaction in it: it was kind of Cousin Abby (sincere & good natured as she is) to come about settling the place for Debby, I much desire they may keep up a harmonious correspondence, & neighbourly intercourse together: because I think it would conduce to the tranquillity of each: how did you leave poor Debby? do [sic] tell me every particular about it, was not she affected at bidding ^you^ farewel [sic]? which of you went home with her? why wouldst thou disturb the house so, & interrupted [sic] the slumbers of the wedded pair. [sic] Poor Peter Cambridge, I am sorry for the situation of his mind, I think I heard that his Mother was not observed to be much afflicted at his conduct, how is that? can she have heard of his loss of reason, I know not whether we should lament his loss of natural understanding, as it clears up his conduct, which other wise [sic] was so inexcusable & reproachful: Either indeed is sorrowful, which is le^a^st so is the question?
It is a pleasing account thou gives of the marriage, I am glad you had Sarah Newlands company ^with^ on so good a commission, my dear love to Cousin Jenny Fuller, any symptom of a growth in her in the best experience, & any outward demonstration that she is faithfully obedient to its [sic] dictates is matter of joy to me, as I well remember in days that are past the sweet cement I felt unite my spirit to hers [sic], many are called, happy for those who are thought worthy of being chosen, this was a matter dear Phebe [sic] had to enlarge on here, & the reason she said why Many were called & few chosen was because more were not attentive to the Call. I love to think of those dear Women, ministers, faithful devoted servants, & ministers of the Gospel, & affectionate tender friends, thy opinion of them is just mine. I believe poor Brother Robert will not be raised by being with them, Chrisy [sic] was much for setting him on in publick service, & talked to me about his being unfaithful, & that he had appeared as a Minister acceptably in England, & that such unfaithfulness kept back the prosperity of our meeting, I said I did not know, she said, that was true I did not, but she thought others of us might come forward, if some did not stand in the way of an encrease of life & power, by their unfaithfulness. I am glad to find sister has recovered so well & that Cousin Polly is recovered also. I am obliged to thee for all the kind information thou takes the trouble to write me. I wish I could make any return: if this ^is^ badly written I have an apology to make, as I am Nursing & writing together, Richard is much delighted with playing with Aby & laughs hearty at him, Richards sickness has not reduced his flesh, he looks very well still. Aby was hold^ing^ thy letter to the fire to dry he said he said for his pretty, pleasant Grand lady [?]. I wish my Cousins may not make little of themselves by giving occasioned for remarks on their intimacy with T: Johnson: how is Frank? Sam saw Billy Rayner in Waterford. I cannot at present inform further concerning him, Sam is fearful of his dieting & lodging with Pat & his wife, as they are not of our profession, he thinks Billys situation is an exposed one, but how could that be helped? there is a true friend Able to save may he seek for his protection.
	Samuel Neal [sic] gone home from Waterford, Betty Gregory confined by indisposition at Joss [?] Strangmans, did not get out at the meeting which I hear was a highly favoured meeting, my Husband & our dear friend Jemmy Abell told me they found it so, dear Jemmy looks thin I fear his life is not to be a very long one, but I have looked at him with a degree of joy & emulation viewing him under preparation for an unchangeable Kingdom: yet perhaps he may be spared a while longer. I had a deal to say to my dear Father, & still seem to have more, it is kind of thee to write me, I want it much, being at times ready to sink under fears & cares. I am so poor a being, & so unequal to the station I fill.
	My dear love & duty attends my Mother & thee & remain
		your dutiful & affectionate daughter
