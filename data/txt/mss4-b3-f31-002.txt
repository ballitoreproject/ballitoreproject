Dear Freind [sic]
R. Shackleton


        To feel silently a gratefull [sic] sense of thy kindness in the receipt of a comfortable and Instructive Epistle seemed the extent of my limited Ability  have been uneasy least [sic] thou ^should^ think me an insansable [sic] receiver of thy favor such a thought would greive [sic] me because that I hope it do not belong to me ~ notwithstanding appearences [sic] may have been against me 
        I once scribbled a long Letter to thee in the distress of my Mind but did not sent it  it was at a time that I was under much uneasyness [sic] concerning leaveing [sic] my Poor Mother  their [sic] appeared a Necessity for it as her present Income  will not exceed 28 a year which would have been to [sic] little for us boeth [sic]  in a manner suitable for my Mother to live in ~ and even now that I have left her am apprehensive it will not be made to do  many secret sorrows attend my poor Mind which I endevour [sic] to Vail [sic] as much as Possable [sic] from Public Vewe [sic] ~ nor unto any one but thee have I mentioned so much   yet have great Cause to be humbley [sic] thankfull [sic]  for many favors unmerrited [sic] favors ~ Being very unexpectedly situated in a Quiet Relegious [sic] Family with my own Uncle who is to me as a father and think I love him as one ~ I have I beleive [sic] and hope shall continue to pay every Dutyfull [sic] and affectionate attentention [sic] ^due^ to my Poor Mother  and its [sic] satisfactory to my Mind that Cousin Bevans seems much to approve of my present Residence ~
        please to present me very affectionately to thy Wife to be remembered by her would be pleasant yet can hardly ask it as I think myself unworthy the notice of any one  thy sentiments with that of thy Wifes on my present situation would be very acceptable to me if thou feels easy to communicate the Councill [sic] of my Best Freinds [sic] was allways [sic] desireable [sic] to me    my Uncle was favored to get well Home on seventh Day Evening He desires his love to be remembered to thee thy Wife and Family
        it have afforded my Mind satisfaction that thou approved of the Freindship [sic] that subsists between Hannah Haughton and me  that we might be kindred minds in the Best sense  is what I wish but alas am affraid [sic] I am not her sister was disappointed at Hannahs [sic] makeing [sic] so short a stay in Limerick it seemed like a pleasant Dream the time passt so soon away ~
if thou should remember it would wish my Dear love to be presented to D. Chandlee and M. Grubb 
        I would esteem it a favor if not very inconvenient to send me a Copy of the Testimony concerning Mabel Wigham  a freind [sic] here particulary [sic] wishes to see it these poor insipid scribble ^lines^ stands in need of many Apoligys but as nothing otherwise could from me be expected hope according to thy wonted kindness thou ^wilt^ excuse them  if I was a better scribe my Freinds [sic] would hear more frequently from me but knowing my own Weakness makes me ^unwilling^ to trouble my Friends often
        Am with affectionate Respect thy Friend
