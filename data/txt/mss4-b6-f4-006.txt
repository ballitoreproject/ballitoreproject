New York 2d month 14th 1819
My dear Friend
Thy truly acceptable Epistle dated
[unclear][/unclear] mo 16th reached me about two weeks since, & as I have
[unclear]no[/unclear] reason to suppose that thou deals in [underline]empty compliments [/underline]
rest satisfied, that our correspondence is [underline]mutually[/underline] agreeable;
& therefore anticipate a kind welcome for my Cogitations.
I, however, reverse the sentiment expressed
in thine, & say, that it is flattering to [underline]Youth[/underline], to receive
the commendations, of age, - particularly when coming
from one, in whom are united, good sense, judgement
& experience. I was truly affected when I heard
of the vacuum in your "Classic vale", caused by the
death of thy amiable & philanthropic brother, Abraham
Shackleton,- but as the change, was to him of infinite
advantage, I trust you felt resigned, under this belief --
It must have been a source of consolation to you,
to witness the respect paid to his remains, & to know
that he will always live in the memory of his friends
The interesting detail of domestic news
with which thou favoured me, brought the recollection
of past times very forcibly to my remembrance- &
I could almost fancy myself, wandering beside the
winding Griese, or playing with my old companions
thro the fields, with "hearts light as air". - What
a fine scope for a poem, was presented [insertion]to[/insertion] the author
of the "Pleasures of Memory."!
I observe that your summer & autumn were
delightful - the influence of the same Cause, whatever
it may be, has extended to our Western World, & we

have experienced the mildest winter, ever remembered
by the oldest citizens of New York. Heretofore, at this
season of the year, our rivers were usually, firmly closed
with ice, & the ground, frozen, to the depth of 2 feet.
but now, no ice is to be seen, & the farmers have
commenced ploughing, in consequence of the moisture
which exists in the land! - Yesterday, for the first time
this month, we had an old fashioned snow storm, which
covered the ground, to the depth of 6 or 8 inches - but
this day's sun will carry it away. During last
month the Thermometer seldom descended below
freezing point, & was frequently upto 50Â°! We want
some second Newton to solve this phenomenon- -
Cobbett has just published the 2d part of his
"Years Residence", which I presume will quickly reach
you. - I have not yet read it, but understand it
contains much entertaining information. - I opened
it in one part where he abuses the [underline]Potatoe[/underline], & says
that when Irishmen come to America they soon forget
the use of it - because they get so much better food.
Now this is false. - for I scarcely ever met an Irishman
yet, sick or poor, who did not lament this root
as one of his greatest privations in the eating way.
If they do not eat so much of them here as in
Ireland, it is because the quality of American Potatoes
is so infinitely inferior.- He has a strange
prejudice against this ne plus ultra of vegetables. -
Morris Birkbecks little volumes were entertaining
enough, but I cannot avoid thinking that
he overrates the advantages & [underline]prospective[/underline] comforts of

his "English Prairie". - No doubt he will entice a
great number of Emigrants to bend their steps towards
Illinois.- Did'st thou read the article in
the Quarterly Review, on those publications? it was
entirely too severe. - that, in the Edinburg was
very flattering. - I think it not impossible that I
may pay him a visit, before I return home. -
I am totally unacquainted with the village
of Ramasso in New Jersey, which has been so unfortunate
as to provoke the enmity of that noted censor
Watty Cox. - I cannot therefore, say whether his allegations
are just - but I place so little reliance on
any thing coming thro' such a deceitful medium, as
his pen, that I would be inclined to praise, whatever
he abused.- In fact were I empanelled to try Watty
for a crime, to which he pleaded guilty, I should
acquit him, on the same ground, that a Jury once
did, a noted[underline] liar[/underline], "Please your Lordship, we bring
him in "not guilty", because he never told [underline]truth[/underline]
in his life."! He does not publish any paper
now, for want of patronage - nor do I know what
is his [underline]calling[/underline]. - I lately saw his name in the
papers as an Insolvent. - He was in our office
the other day, to complain of a Captain, whose
vessel came consigned to us, for not delivering a
Puncheon of Whiskey [underline]full[/underline], which had leaked out
on the voyage! - I think in his face are concentrated
the most diabolical features! - & Lavater would surely
call the possessor of them, a bad, worthless fellow.
It ought indeed to be [insertion]a[/insertion] subject of
serious reflection, when we witness the degradation

of human nature, in the acts, of which such great
& good men as Romilly & Whitbread, have been guilty.
What is there in us, that can so eradicate every moral
& religious feeling; as to admit of a temporary insanity
which impels to such deeds? Was it to account
for such a paradox that induced Pope to say?
"In spite of Fate, in erring reason, spite
"One truth is clear, whatever is, is right."
I was pleased to observe, the high encomiums which
the most bigotted Ministerial papers, passed on the
good Sir Samuel Romilly. - "Bad as the world is, respect
is always paid to virtue"! -
What a detestable system, is that of duelling!
I make the exclamation, while a late occurrence at
Washington, is fresh in my remembrance. Two
Generals in the American Army, united by ties of
blood & marriage, & both not far advanced in life
had a difference about some political business, not
more than a year ago. - Ten days since, while the
Congress of their Country were debating on National
affairs, these misguided men, met in a field contiguous
to the City, & fought with [underline]muskets[/underline], [underline]trebly[/underline]
charged, within twelve feet of each other!! I think
I never heard of such a deliberate intention to [insertion]commit[/insertion] murder
One of them was Killed on the Spot, & the other badly
wounded. - I am afraid this crime will never
cease, until the sure punishment of the gallows
awarded to the Survivor, or both parties, as the case
may be. - Frederick the Great's plan, was, to make
them fight, (when a challenge was given) until one fell
& then, to hang the other. -
