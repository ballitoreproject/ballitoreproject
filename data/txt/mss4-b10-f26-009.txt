Liege March 14th 1847
My dear Mother
Here we are tired enough
at least I am - but hope to be better by & bye
when I get some refreshment - We left London
yesterday 1/4 before 4 for Croydon and saw
Polly & Selina who look very well and
are I think improved they seem quite
happy there & like the school very well - We
took the Dover train a little before six and
arrived at Dover about 1/2 past 9 slept at
the [unclear]Gum[/unclear] Hotel and went on board the
"Belgium railway" steamer at 1/2 past 6
and sailed soon after had a good passage
and were not sick (but I was not quite
comfortable) We arrived at Ostend a little
before 12 - had our passports examined - our
luggage was examined onboard - but they
searched my hand basket on going on shore.
We went to a very nice Hotel with a

Gentleman who slept at the same Inn at Dover
and [deletion][/deletion] Thos. made up an acquaintance with him
and he kindly offered to give whatever information
or assistance he could to us as long as we were
together - we had a steak [insertion]& Potatos[/insertion] and some Hot Claret
negus and were a good deal the better of it - we took
our places in the train to Liege the farthest way
we could get on to night - but we stopped and
had refreshment again at Malines between
4 & 5 oclock we changed carriages there and
saw a great variety of people who seemed
to assemble merely to see the arrival &
departure of the trains - some were very
English wh did not interest me much
but there were various costumes that
were quite pretty - we left Malin√®s at
five and arrived here at 8 we have taken
Coffee and I think will not be long out
of bed for I am tired - we start at seven
in the morning for Cologne & where we
are to go from that I do not yet know as
Thos. has been advised to change his course
 by which our journey would be a good [insertion]deal[/insertion]
shortened - but he has not quite decided
yet - I hope all are well at home it seems
a very long time since I left you - & I shall be
quite fidgetty until I hear from you - we have
had very fine weather so far - but there is a good
deal of snow on the ground as we came along
and a gentleman at Malines told us they had
very severe weather up to the last week that
in fact [underline]today[/underline] was the first that was at all
fine - we saw a good deal of Ice too - but the
sun was very hot today & would soon melt
it - I enclose a note that Thos. brought away
 with him in mistake he will be obliged to your
putting it in the post just as
it is - we do not happen to have
a stamp to put on it - there
are four english gentlemen at the table next
to us they are very merry - three of them came
across from Dover with us - one is a very young
man going on a tour - another is in the Corn trade
and is going to Constantinople - and a third is
the one with whom we made acquaintance &
who is coming on to Cologne - with us tomorr -
We walked a good deal about London but did
not go see any sights there did not seem to be
time between getting the passport money bills
etc. George Crawford gave up his whole time to us
whilst we staid in Loudon - he expect to remain
there for nearly another month -

It is very curious to see the dirty blackboards
of these fine rooms of the French - this one for
instance in which I now write is a very [unclear]good[/unclear]
one as large as the drawing room in Fitzwilliam
Square where James lived - 3 large windows hung
with white muslin curtains chairs & tables french
polished and four fine looking glasses
but the boards uncarpetted and black tho I
believe not really dirty - our bedroom too
is large & airy with two nice clean french
beds and every thing comfortable but
no carpet except a rug at each bed side
the sheets & towels far nicer than what
we got in England - I was quite surprised
to see the country girls as we came along
today through Belgium without bonnets
but with exceedingly nice caps - like the
dress caps you sometimes see in the Dublin
shop windows various colored ribbon and
sometimes white with flowers - this is a
very incoherent letter there is such a buzz
about me I scarcly know what I am writing
but it will do do tell you how we are
with dear love to all I am my dear mother
your affect. daughter EH -
I am not writing to any
one else now so you might
tell any one that cares the contents of this
