August 1807
You are quite welcome to have your letters directed under coors to
Mr. Smith, as one a month from yourself and Friend will not inconvenience
him - the direction is, William Smith Eswr. M.P. Pamdon near
Harlow Essex - and you will be so good as to be cautious that the
Letters [underline]do not weigh quite an ounce[/underline]
I am very glad the attempt has been made to teach Owen to knit, and
I daresay after a little preliminary discourse from you, that in the winter
you will succeed, and your scheme for teaching the jusing Boys is a
very good one indeed. I should think that if a little reward were given to
them, and perhaps if it were added that whole Schools of Boys in England
all well
[underline][unclear]you[/unclear][/underline]

knit their own stockings, it might have a good effect, on these high
spirited teachies. It is a very great pleasure indeed to hear that the widow
and her children go on so well - I suppose the oldest Boy will soon be able
support himself by shoemaking, and perhaps the Girls may be [unclear]inclured fst[/unclear]
to go into service in a few years - We were much delighted with
your narration of Captain Bobadil. I must however say that he
was suffered too cauly to escape. I have not time to add more
was suffered too cauly to escape - I have not time to add more
than my wishes for your welfare. And am truly and
Pamdon House
august 28 1807 -
with much regard yours
Frances Smith
