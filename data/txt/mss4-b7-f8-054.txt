Waterford 19 January 1807
The receipt of my dear Cousins valued favour
raised in my mind many pleasing emotions;
I hastened to execute the Commission therein contained
being well acquainted with Wm Hughes
the brother in law of Mr Walsh I committed the
enclosure to his care & doubt not that the safe
arrival of it has ere now come to thy knowledge
With pleasure I learn the conclusion thou hast
come to of gratifying the public with some
of thy productions & will readily lend my
assistance in procuring subscriptions if such
be the mode of publication thou means to adopt:
I flatter myself I can contribute to swell the
number - Pray let me know the conditions as
soon as the plan shall be mature. The pathetic
mer 'ceau enclosed to Mr Walsh is a genuine picture
of nature & flows with admirable ease, highly

interesting to the reader & bringing in a manner
the scenes of those eventful times before his
eyes - I hope they may be never again realised
to our view. I did not consider there had been
such a lapse of time since we met I must
if we should be spared & that I can accomplish
it steal a few days during the ensuing summer
to take a peep at the original, from whom
such a pleasing portrait has been drawn, surrounded
by her delighted & delightful group.
I plainly perceived I have entered on the decline
of life my head begins to be sprinkled
with grey & I experience in some measure a
diminution of sight my little ones around
me look for provision for the future when they
shall be deprived of my exertions which
has occasioned us to conclude on commencing
the sale of soft Goods in some little peddling
way by the way of experiment I intended
to have applied to Cousin Thos Chandlee
for instruction in order to initiate Becca into

the mysteries of her intended profession when I heard
with much concern of the badness of his health.
Poor Debby has met with a considerable portion
of the bitters of this life: May we all who experience
a share know how to appreciate them
& endeavour to convert them into comforts.
I cordially congratulate you all on the prospect
of reviving the old establishment - the talents
[unclear]of the[/unclear] conductor are in high estimation I hope
[unclear][/unclear] as my Richard shall become [unclear][/unclear]
entrust him to your care he is turned of five
not yet master of the Alphabet. Becca & the
children are obliged by the kind mention of
them: We have along with us Wife's Mother & two
Sisters - the former in a very melancholy state
asthmatic & feeble all other branches of the family
are favoured with tolerable health. I wish to
be presented affectionately to Cousin Sally & any
other who bestows a thought on
thy loving kinsman & sincere friend
