friends, Jonathan & Anne Bachhouse, 10
miles, conducted thither by Thos.. Binks.
Sarah continuing poorly, our host prescribed
for her, & by care, getting her stomach
clear'd, & bathing her feet, she
got much better, & a quiet night: yet
being very weakly the 25th.. we had
our plan a little altered, & instead of
going forward in the evening, concluded
to stay over first-day. Both meetings
trying to me, I was very desirous
indeed to be [underline]made[/underline] willing, & if this
was happily accomplished, still to be
preserved in the fear of the Lord,
not of man. A deal of speaking, went
in the evening to tea to Joseph Pease's,
where was, I thought, a precious appearance
in supplication, thro' a member
of this meeting: encouraged hereby
I ventured a little. After tea we
call'd to bid Jane Bachhouse farewell
