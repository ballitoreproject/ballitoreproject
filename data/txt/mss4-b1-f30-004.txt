The purport of a Dream which I Jno Rutter of Liverpool
a young man abt. 23 years of Age. Dreamed about 4 Weeks
before his Death being rather weak in Body.
I thought (said he) I had for some Time been unwell
And was taking a ride out, thinking perhaps the fresh Air
might be a means to regain my Health, When I Came to a
large Grave Yard wherein there was divers Graves Stones
with Inscriptions on them, And a Curiosity to read them seized
my Mind whereupon I alighted from my Horse & fasten'd him
to the Gate of the Grave Yard I went into it, & as I was reading
very attentively, Upon my looking round me I saw upon
the opposite side of the Grave Yard A Man who seemed to be
far advanced in Years, & was coming towards me, he seemed
to me to have a long White Beard, And when he approached
near to me I thought he then seemed the most amiable &
bea[insertion]u[/insertion]tiful Man I had ever seen before, he had on each Shoulder
a large Wing, which seem'd to shine & glitter like the
Sun - In his right Hand he had a Scythe, as an Emblem
of Death, And in his Left he had an Hour Glass an Emblem
of Time, When he came up close to me, he accosted me in
a very Solemn Manner, & Query'ed of me. What drew me
so early among the Tombs - I answer'd that I was taking
a ride out, & as I passed I could not be easy without
alighting off my Horse, & perusing the Inscriptions that
were then before me, whereupon he reply'd - There was a
many both Young & Old lay Extended there, & says he -
Suppose ere Long, thou shouldst be called hence & be no
more in this World, Art thou ready to Leave it? - Whereupon
I returned him that I was not so well prepared as I hoped
to be if Providence wd favour me a little Longer - He then
looked Steadfastly on me, & said, Well then let me warn
thee to prepare thyself for thou wilt perhaps be called hence
before thou art aware! - Make the Lord thy God, the
Subject of thy Morning [deletion]Subject[/deletion] Song, & Evening [deletion]Song[/deletion]
prayer - But ere long I will see thee again, & in the

mean while, I advise thee to make Good use of thy Time
& be not over anxious to Live, thou hast already been too
anxious - I must now take Leave of thee, & upon that
he put out his Hand as if I must shake hands with him, &
I offer'd him my Hand but could feel no Substance, whereupon
I looked him in the Face, & was smiling at me, &
Immediately he Disappeared & Vanish'd from my Sight.
