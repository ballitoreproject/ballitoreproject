that S:T intended to visit families in this place
I am indeed a poor unqualified creature to join
in such a work. - Sarah has desired I may dip
into it, & feel whether I have a part in it or not
&c: &c:, easy said, - but none know my poverty.
Had seven sittings, & came home weary. 21st.. eight
sittings. 22d.. Travel'd 16 miles & sat with three families
23d.. After breakfast Rachel came with us to visit a
neighbour of her's, who requested it, her name Elizabeth
Phillips, genteel folk, her husband sat with us, &
I believe it might be termed [underline]a good meeting[/underline]. Afterwards
sat with a friend & her daughter, & rested
the afternoon. 24th.. First-day. Morning meeting not
silent, nor was the silence (I trust) improperly broken:
had two sittings before evening meeting, which
compleated that work here, in all twenty two visits.
Evening meetings put off till six O'clock, & others
invited, I hope to the ease of S:T mind. 25th.. went
12 miles, to meeting to Bath, in company with
Robt.. Fowler & wife &c: there I saw Sarah Cooper
& daughter Nancy, who told me dismal tales
about poor Ireland. After dinner travel'd 13 miles
[unclear]&[/unclear] some indifferent road, to Frenchay, took tea at
Robt.. Lovell's, & went at five O'Clock to their
meetg.
