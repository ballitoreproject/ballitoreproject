Anner Mills 4th day 7th 8th 20
My beloved friend,
About two weeks ago - I forwarded an ill packed
Basket of old papers. childrens letters. & a Frogmore which
Jane made in a hurry. for Leydia's acceptance & which
mostly likely-- will have been so discomposed ere it reaches
Ballitore as not to be fit for her nice flowers - - -
Be assured my dear friends that [insertion]you[/insertion]continue to be the
subjects- of my grateful remembrance tho' I may be
deficient in expression for the kind attentions received - it
was truly a refreshing time to me - many ways. & a time
"not to be forgotten." the sweet influences of heavenly love
is through Merciful condescension at [unclear]reasons felt[/unclear]
thy poor unworthy [deletion]beings[/deletion] mortals. how happy should
we be if our cheif object was to [underline]serve[/underline] Him. in the way
of [unclear]His[/unclear] choosing and not according[deletion]s[/deletion] to our own ideas.
It appears in my apprehension a mistake which
many of us & perhaps more or less all of us. are
in-- resting satisfied with any thing short of continued
watchfulness- my dear Aunt M. Grubb- has been
our sweet guest since this day week - several days
I had the privilege of riding out with her, once to see the
dear sufferers of Milbrook. . whose lives were spared by
an overriding Providence - - Mary [unclear]Wrangmen's[/unclear] arm
is still in a pitious state so swelled & discoloured lying
useless in her lap. Annie's face by nice surgery will escape
any disfiguring effect. but the state of her head . (brain) [unclear][/unclear]

continues to be an object of solicitude they dare not call this
[unclear]dispurstin[/unclear] an affliction. I trust it is [unclear]Hener[/unclear] to them all. dear
Sarah Wrangmen writes sweetly from Leondon--our precious
Sarah also continues to send us most interesting letters
I should like to send them to Nice if a proper opportunity offered
tho' the previous child would think. from such observaton
- the writer of being [underline]quite[/underline] well. but apprehensive
that she would miss seeing dear L. Grellet. he was at Tottenham
- when she & her Aunt were at Wandsworth. Where
her cousins were very kind - in observing who was most
interesting. she describes the King's carriage as being very
low- & the windows so [unclear]stopt[/unclear] with nosegays of beautiful
flowers that his person was scarcely visible
We had been at Newgate with [unclear]b Fry[/unclear] - and a grand train
of titled personages - at a meeting on Bison discipline
Where the Duke of Glocester took the choir-- they heard
many celebrated speakers- and tho they took their
tests at 11 - oclock & were stationary untill five in the
afternoon - the time did not seem long or fatiguing
our Leydia was quite poorly for some [deletion]some[/deletion] days
in consequence I believe of overexertions weeding in the
garden. she & her sisters tasked by the number of
wheelbarrows. this fine day she seems quite herself
& has been riding the pon[insertion]e[/insertion]y about the Avenue. I have
learned to bear the chains pretty well. am still unprovided with
a safe horse. yesterday. little Rebecca rode with Aunt & me

to see Eliza Grubb & her lovely baby (Sarah Haughton Grubb)
the mother looks thin & delicate. Richards wife is missing
her. my strength has increased considerably but the pain
of my head. & particularly one eye - disqualifys me
from being of [underline]any[/underline] [underline]use [/underline]to [underline]myself [/underline]or [underline]others[/underline]. so that I am often
cast [insertion]down[/insertion] from the conviction of the worthless creature I am
become. even the poor invalids. who expected relief
on my return. continue to be rejected in their applications.
& I am obliged to shut my eyes & ears from their
intreaties--- perhaps tomorrow I may get to meeting
which if accomplished will be a great effort gained
Our Barclay is quite warm about his mother. that there
should be an idea that it was not real illness which
prevented my proceeding to Dublin-- we are not informed
respecting cousin M Leskey's health. please to give my
dear love to thy sister Chandlee I have her seven letters safe
I am not disposed to part with them yet- if she can spare them
how is Anne Doyle? I wish she would try [unclear][/unclear] tea. a cup
in the morning--- what her poor Abby Widdows fixed
on? I often think of his easy arm chair - & comfortable fireside
did the fine little boy recover? Sarah writes. that Homah
Buxton is [unclear]composed [/unclear]& resigned Tho' deep seated sorrow is fixed
in his countenance. the eldest daughter is in delicate health
& gone with her mother & two other children to Sunbridge Wills
the infant only left at home--
So many Banks have closed in Munster. as to cause serious distress.
poor William Newport it is thought fell a victim to agitation
being an aged man

thou will gratify me by saying if thou received the border
as I should not like every curious eye to peep into the
papers - & also to destroy this letter - which tho' [unclear]inco[/unclear]
& uninteresting has tried my head - poor Sarah is grateful
for the package from Ballitore - I have not written
her a letter since. thy dear sister Sally I often
think of Lydia - sweet girl will I hope of some time
pay us a visit - present me affectionately to thy husband
son. Thy Sister Shackleton & her children - &c. &c. &c-
My son Barclay writes requesting a Ballitore Straw hat
such as the scholars wear. My husband is asleep
in bed. & will probably ere long start and [unclear]ruin[/unclear] me
our little Rebecca has joined her [unclear]A[/unclear] [unclear][/unclear] good
opinion
dearly farewell thy much obliged
dont thou make the Ink for stamping the
letters? I have a stamp which would
be useful for coarse things . but wont Ink
A most comfortable letter
this morning from Sarah
