23rd April 1814.
My dear Mrs Leadbeater
From your [underline]very[/underline]
strong recommendation of Mr. White I
am induced to send my eldest Son
Sandford (11 years old in June next) to his
School, which I assure you is contrary
to his other friends wishes. the place
being so far distant for so young s
Boy, however, my confidence in your
friendship, & your family's, assures me
that [underline]every[/underline] attention to his health,
[unclear][/unclear] &c. &c. will to [unclear]hand[/unclear], the same as
Morals etc. etc. will be hard, the same as
if he was within a mile of me, & I
am sure this confidence is not misplaced;
I have also a pride in thinking
that my conduct some years back
in your [unclear][/unclear] & [unclear][/unclear] cannot fail
in your Jenn. & Cusy.. cannot fail
to

to insure some friends for my Child
shou'd his health require at any time
the tender care, and attention of one
of your Sex, to you therefore I now
commit him (on that score, thank
GOD in a high Health, and spirits
as I cou'd wish: as to his Education
I must entreat you to [unclear][/unclear] my old
friend your Brother A. that [unclear][/unclear]
with the utmost confidence to his
recollection of me, is now, [unclear][/unclear]
inspecting his studies, & if I am not
grossly mistaken he will prove [underline]no[/underline]
discredit to Ballitore School; I am
sensible most father's are partial
to their Son's, many very blindly so,
nevertheless, I shall not be deterred
from telling you that if your new
acquaintance does not cut a figure
in learning, it will not be his fault
as

as I am convinced he is possess'd of an
excellent natural understanding, with
very good abilities, and as good a disposition
as a boy [underline]can[/underline] have, but he is
like [underline]all[/underline] boys, fond of his little amusements,
such to [unclear][/unclear] if permitted, but
he is very easily [unclear][/unclear], and under
their decided opinions of mine, if he
does not turn out a capital Scholar
it will be difficult to persuade me
the fault lays with him; it is my
wish he shou'd be well grounded in
the Classics, & also in the French Language,
as to every thing else necessary
for a Gentleman to learn. I depend on
Mr. White from your description of him
you know he is quite a stranger to
me, as I understand from your Brother,
that your Nephew Richard, who I have
reason to think is a young Man of
great talents, & information, attends to
the School, may I beg you to introduce
my

my Boy particularly to him, & for
my sake to try he will not let
him to be [unclear][/unclear]. & when he can form
a judgment of his abilities, he
will extremely oblige me by letting
me have his candid opinion.
My friend Mr. [unclear]Citha[/unclear] will deliver
Sandford I trust safe into your
Hands, & if you want any franks
for England I will most readily
give them to you. Make my best
regards to all my old friends,
& [unclear]believe[/unclear] me dear Mrs L—
Your very sincere friend,
[underline]Sandford Palmer.[/underline]
[unclear]Emland[/unclear] you have an order on one of
your friends in Besc[unclear][/unclear] for 18 [unclear]Guins[/unclear]. which I
[unclear]preserve[/unclear] with [unclear]ansd.[/unclear] Mr. Whites purpose —
