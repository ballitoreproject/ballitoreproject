My Dear Madam
my thanks for your elegant and flattering
little poem in Verse - but I lead such
a life of eternal interruption from morning
till night - I seldom write three lines without
being obliged to lay down my pen to attend to
some person- or some other Mother- her
[unclear]passions[/unclear] can never pretend to leave or [unclear]orders[/unclear]
to be at home - already in those few lines
I have had breaks in my little business -
and to have the thread of our Ideas snaged
Every moment - when writing poetry - woud make
it for being limping if not [underline]wholey[/underline] [underline]lame[/underline] performance;
Accept thou please Madam my thanks in
Humble person - but alas I fear you so much
It was my intention to return
[1817]
[insertion]over-rate[/insertion]

merits, as you do my acquirements -
for they indeed are but of second rate -
I never was taught to draw - nor Even [unclear]practised[/unclear]
from my own Ideas in Early life - all my
painted performances were on silk of tiffany -
so have Effect - not neatness - were all that was
necessary - as they have only to decorate the
bottoms of gowns or petticoats - till that
up here - I never drew a group of flowers
or a landscape - and then, could scarcely
ever get any thing good to copy -
And alas - [unclear]smothered[/unclear] my hand - to draw
forth sterling notes - from the much admired
and melodious harp - it was not the
the vogue when I was young - and since it became
so general - I have been too much entangled
in losses - to indulge my self with learning
the Harp - which otherways I certainly woud
have done - as I understand the Harpsicord,

and once possessed a Voice much
extoll'd - but by long silence - and frequent
severe colds in winter - it has nearly lost
all its sweetness and powers -
Thus Madam you see how little I have
to boast of ornamental - but as to [underline]mental[/underline]
shame woud it be, I suffered them to rust -
[deletion]of[/deletion] [underline]Time[/underline], and retirement - injurious to the [unclear]grease[/unclear],
have a contrary Effect on our Virtues - and to
turn our misfortunes to our advantage is the
truest philosophy - that I have done so -
is surely doubly fortunate to me - it has indeed
Illum'd the walls of my prison - perhaps
in no other situation woud I have acted
so much to my Credit - or satisfaction - for
the sunshiny path of life - is not the one
in which we gather most of our Virtues -
I have to thank you too Madam for
some pleasant hours since Mrs. Chambers
came here - which was spent in reading
your

poems - your Cottage Stores - an Annals
of Ballytore - you may judge how much
I wish to see you - when first we began our
readings, I took it for granted you were dead,
and you cannot conceive the agreeable surprise
I experienced on discovering you were still alive
and that I might chance to have the pleasure
of seeing you - and I think you will not let
Mrs. Chambers remain much longer without the
pleasure - I am delighted too with your
Brother - whom I know as well as if I had
spent a year in his house - in fact - were
I to pass thro Ballytore - I believe I woud
find it impossible not to stop and visit you
all -
believe me Dear Madam
with sincere respect -
your most cordial well
wisher - J: Danley
Four Court Marshalsea
