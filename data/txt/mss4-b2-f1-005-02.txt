My dear James,


++ I find thou hast had another stroke of bodily affliction, a species of chastisement which has been seldom administered to me since my adult age - & yet I have not been, nor am I without chastisement. I suffer in mind, thou suffers in body and mind. The various dealings of Providence with various dispositions are doubtless ordered in Infinite Wisdom - And we doubtless learn by these dispensations, though our advancement is so gradual that it is imperceptible to ourselves. The rod in its season is as necessary as the staff. However we are apt to desire for our friends as for ourselves, an alleviation of trouble, & I would be glad to hear that thy amendment continued.
