April 1821.
Dear Mrs Leadbeater I am sorry to say that the number of our franks
now is so very limited, that it is not in our power to comply with your wishes
by receiving or sending the number that you mention.
I have three of your letters now by me lying to be posted the first convenient
opportunity, which will probably occur either on Sunday next the 22 or the
Sunday following the 29. I am just going to Tunbridge Wells but I shall
leave directions for them to be presented to Mr. Smith, and if his number
is not full I am sure that he will do them
Mr. Smiths number of franks are now every day, I believe I may say,
filled by his own letters and those of his House of business, so that
I scarcely ever ask him for a frank for myself or friends, but of a
Sunday. I reserve all my letters for that day, of course you will conclude
that our Sunday franks are generally occupied.
Indeed I find that our [insertion]House[/insertion] pays a large Sum every year for Postage.
Thus you find that many of our letters although franked [underline]must[/underline] pay, for no
member of parliament can frank more than ten.
Do not however be uneasy about your 3 letters they shall be sent - although
franks with us are so very scarce that we neither secure or send more
than we can help. I am dear Mrs. Leadbeater
Yours very Sincerely
Frances Smith
