My dear Mamma
We got in here about
7 O'Clock this morning after
a long & unpleasant voyage
but thank God we are all
safe & well - the day we left
you, we met [unclear]Calms[/unclear], & only
got to Sherries that night
where we staid, as we found

Mr Gowan could not start
till about 10 O'Clock on Sunday
morning, we had a nice quiet
night there & started about
the time I mentioned, we
had but very little wind all
that day, so got some knocking
about in the [unclear]Calms[/unclear], but that
night it Came on a very
thick fog so that they had
to make their vessels lie
too, (that is not to go on),
as it is the safest plan,
& as we could not be
sure where we were, so
we had to stay that day,
all that night, & yesterday,
(it was the longest fog I
was ever in) and this morning
at about 1/2 past one a
heavy rain came on, &
the fog got thinner so
that they were able to see
the Copeland lights, so then
we made sail, & are just

after anchoring here, but
it is still pouring rain.
I wonder is the weather as
bad with you. I think they
can scarcely have any regatta
to-day here, Mr. Gowan's boat
is to run the second day
of the race - please write
immediately on receipt of
this, directed to [underline]Belfast[/underline]
[underline]Post Office[/underline] & I think we
will get it, as Manliff

says he does not intend
to leave this untill the
weather improves, he thinks
we may have leave this about
Thursday, [insertion]Eveg.[/insertion] he bids me
give[deletion]s[/deletion] his love to you, &
that he hopes you are
taking care of yourself
& that every thing is going
on right, - a day or
two after you write to
Belfast, I wish you would

either write, or get Mary
Gough to write, & direct
it to Gourock, [insertion]Post Office[/insertion] Scotland
and it is likely we will
get it, - I intend to
write again before we
leave this, but that would
be too long for you to
put it off - I must
say Farewell with love
to all, including Mary G.
& Eliza your much attached
MJB-
