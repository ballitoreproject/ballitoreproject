Thy few lines, my dear William, from Sallins were very
comfortable, thy getting so timely, & meeting so good a way of
sending thy horse was quite clever; thy absence hangs heavy enough
at times, yet yesterday the remembrance of that day twelve months, &
the unutterable anguish which then tore my mind, rose so to view, contrasted
with present sunshine, as I hope raised a degree of gratitude, & consequent
desire to merit the blessings enjoyed - I shudder to think of the danger thou
escaped by not having been at the Mill yesterday, which might have
turned all my joy into the deepest sorrow - As sister wrote I suppose she
mentioned that in hoisting a sack of wheat 36 st up the lofts at the
store, the chain broke when at the top, & the sack fell on [unclear]Jam [/unclear]
by which both his hips & knee were dislocated I suppose,
[unclear][/unclear], & I imagine dreadfully crushed beside - the Dr. said
he could do nothing for him I hear; yet I understand to-day he is [unclear][/unclear]
better, but believe there is little hopes of his life; they say some of the
joints have been got in again. It makes a great stir to besure, & I believe
people are displeased that the sacks are not got up as they are at the
mill - I hope you will get it altered as soon as possible. for my heart
is ready to sink lest a sack should fall upon thee, & this is selfish I own.
MWebster tells us, & our kitchen folk confirm it, that this man & his wife
formerly sold ale, & in a tent they had at the Curragh they had an affray
with a young man whom they murdered - that they escaped, & eluded the
pursuit of his friends, but were afraid to follow publick business - however
we do not like to talk of this, we might be reflected upon for doing so, & if
vengeance suffereth him not to live, mercy has given some time to repent.
Debby Wilson came herself yesterday to see me, thinking I was frighted, which I
took kind, but I was not affected so as to do me harm, perhaps not as much
as I ought to have been, I was so glad thou wert not there. Mother is of best

fashion I think, got to meeting, & we were both at the Mill to-day. Josa.
Webster there - I am quite well I think - would be glad of a letter from thee
if inclination & convenience permit it, but shall I believe be quite satisfied
if I get none, hoping we are epistles written in each others hearts. Mother's
dear love to thee, & mine, also to Sally & poor, dear Anna. Also present it to
Joseph Garratt, & tell him I was obliged by his letter, that I waited to let
him know the picture had arrived before I acknowledged it: but tell him
the picture is not yet come- Could thou get me 1/2 oz oil Vitriol without
danger of it damaging what it would come in company with? Jonas
Duckett was out in his carriage to-day. Joseph Strangman, who is now
here, tells us that R: Jacob's brother WWhite & his family are come to
live in Carlow, in the house Cousin Joseph Thompson lived in.
Dearly farewell says thy
