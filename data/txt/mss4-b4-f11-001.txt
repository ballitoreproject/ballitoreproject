Dear Father

me the sixty Pounds by Ben Haughton but I
expected thee put it to intrest & that it amounted
to a good deal more if thee did I am sure thee will
not wrong me out of it & if not it cannot be helpt
Ben told me thee would give the little things
of mine that are in the house to me I thank thee
and beg thee will give them to William Gill & he
will send them if thee will not please to do it.
Dear Father thee has been always kind
to me & I pray thee not to leave me in the great
trouble I am in for thy anger towards me but
be so tender to forgive me my fault & intreat
my Mother to do so too I implore you
to deny me this earnest request no longer for
I am sencerely sorry for vexing you be pleased
to get my Mother to accept my Duty & give my
Love to Aunts Brother & Sisters I am dear Father
thy Loving & Affectionate Daughter
