Clonmel 9th of 1st month 1781

My dear Father,
	I am favoured with thy last kind letter, & find you have been visited there with indisposition, it is pleasing to hear you were rather mending, I hope my Mother & sister Lydia are quite recovered ere now, it is pretty easy I think to guess at the Chink-cough, such a hooping attends it, many children I hear have it very easy this year, which I hope will be my little Nephew Richards case, I am somewhat alarmed about my own little Richard, he continues poorly, & has a very disagreeable cough, I gave him an emetick last night, which I thought eased him, still he seems oppressed & looks very wan, & his face narrow, so that I have been fearful lest he should be on the decline, at times I console my mind with a hope that it proceeds from teething, he is very lively at times, & generally rests well at night unless disturbed by coughing: the Doctor seems to think me more alarmed than there is reason for; he was a fine child until he was seized with that gathering in his jaw three months ago, the stuping rendered him so tender that I believe he has got cold often since with what I thought a suitable airing. Abraham & Anne bravely. Abraham goes to School, he cannot read, but spells a little, I read him the part of thy letter that was for him, to which he seemed attentive, & made some remark I think, which I have forgotten, he is seldom peevish, & both he & Anne in general pretty well behaved, I think there is an improvement in the manners of each, perhaps I am inclined to think more favourably of them than they merit.
	I am much obliged to thee for dear Esther Tukes letters, I have not had time to read them yet, therefore must request permission to detain them a while longer, I am often desirous to write & read when interruptions come to prevent, in the morning I cannot rise early because of keeping the child as long as I can asleep, & at night he does not settle to sleep well in the Cradle, so that I am obliged to hurry to bed, especially when he is not quite well, as he was such a fine forward child, it grieves me when I let in fears of his being in bad health, yet have a hope he will get better again. What is this World! but a place of great uncertainty, & the fairest hopes may be blasted as in a moment, I am at times almost disgusted with it, happy for those who have their affections weaned from it, & placed on things that are out of the reach of fluctuation & change. My Husband is gone as thou supposed to Cork. I have just received a letter from him, he mentions my Father Grubbs not being well there, & that his spirits are much affected, but hopes he will be better soon; I am of thy opinion that it is profitable to break off at times from Worldly cares, & hope this will be a refreshment to my well-mended Husband, but I believe loss is sustained in a principal manner for want of inwardness when at home, & a diligent constant attention to the teacher always present, if we were so engaged when at Home, we should reap more benefit by going abroad: I hope we shall benefit by thy seasonable advice to endeavour ^daily^ after that cleansing power, it is a great favour to receive such co^u^nsel, & a great advantage to us if we practise it. Molly Dudley was here this morning, I read her part of thy letter & she desired her dear love to thee & my Mother
Sister Sally (John) by last account is recovering well, little Sally poorly as usual, Betsy a fine child. I did not hear of the death of Doctor Fothergill until thy letter mentioned him, what did he die of? I am obliged to my Mother for making excuses for me about writing, it is a refreshment to me to hear from you, & a pleasure to converse any way with you, therefore I must endeavour for time to write you little or much, I consider it also my duty, as it pleases you; & it is amongst the favours of Divine Goodness that I have Parents who are so solicitous about me, I sometimes feel the distance you are from me painfully, I reflect what a consolation it would be to me to be near you in Seasons of affliction, (which as yet I may say comparatively I have met with little of) & also a stay to my poor mind at all seasons, but I enjoy many favours, & desire very few.
I suppose thou got the letter to my Brother Chandlee, & forwarded it to him, my dear love to them when thou writes or sees them also to Cousin Abby.
	I forgot to say I take care of thy letters intrusted to my charge, having them safe in a letter case
	My dear love & duty attends you where due, & am
		thy affectionate daughter

Betty Pope was well.
