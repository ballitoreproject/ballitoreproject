Wisbech 7 mo 19th 1781 -
I am so conscious my dear Friend
how little claim I have to thy Indulgence, that I
am really at a loss in what manner to address
thee, or how to apologize for my silence; the
increasing Concerns of my little Family are
all [insertion]that[/insertion] I have to alledge in defence of it, & they
I must own are not a sufficient excuse for
neglecting so valuable a Correspondence, & one
that I can truly say I esteem as highly as
ever, then what shall I say my dear Friend?
shall I confess to thee (for I believe it is the truth)
that these domestic Concerns do engross too much
of my Attention, & that my Mind is too seldom
in such a Situation as I wish to address thee
in - hence I am sensible that my Letters are
not worth thy acceptance - these only are the

Reasons why I have not written - if I could believe
that I had yet a claim to thy sympathy, & could
hope for the Continuance of thy friendship if thou
knew me as I really am, I should rejoice in being
still favour'd with thy Epistles, & I would strive
to be more diligent in replying to them - -
Thy last Letter found me under the trial
of some painful Circumstances, our Children
were none of them quite well, two of them were
much otherwise, & my Mind was deeply tried
with a sense of inward poverty & distress -
- at such a time it was truly acceptable to receive
a fresh token of thy remembrance, tho' it renewed
will full force my regret for not having
answer'd thy former favour - I wish'd to have
written thee immediately, & should have been very
glad to have had it in my power to prevail with thee
to visit our Habitation, but that was a favour I
could not flatter myself with any hope of obtaining

unless thou had been travelling in this part of the
Nation, in which case I trust thou would not easily
have pass'd us by - it would have been pleasing
to me to have made an acquaintance with thy Daughter
Debby when she was in England - I understand
since that time she is married, & settled near thee
which must be very agreeable - if thou favours
me so far as to write again, I shall be glad to
receive any particular relating to thy Family,
as I feel much regard for them tho' Personally
unknown - - I find thou art inform'd (thro'
thy kind enquiries after me) of my present Engagement
of nursing, my Son Richard is a fine
thriving Boy, his three Brothers with my Husband
& self, are now thro' Mercy all well, our eldest Son
has been at home about six weeks, but is going
to School again shortly - - My Brother was
here when I receiv'd thy Letter, & desir'd to be kindly
remember'd to thee when I wrote - I suppose thou

may have heard that he is yet unmarried, the young
Woman he has made Choice of is very agreeable to
all his Friends, & I hope in time those difficulties
will be remov'd which at present retard their Union.
My Husband writes with me in kind regards
to thyself & Family, with which I remain
Thy Oblig'd and Affectionate Friend
