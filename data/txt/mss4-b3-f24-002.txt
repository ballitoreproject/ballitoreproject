Woodbridge: 21/6 month 1776.

My dear wife,

	I have wrote divers letters to thee by Sam Pim, by James Luky [sic] & by post from London. I have received a letter from thee & from each of the children while there. I have not since heard from any of you, which I much long for, have some hopes that a Letter will have arrived at London from you, & that it will be forwarded to me from thence to Norwich where I expect to be to morrow night: their Yearly Meeting is to be there next week. Thou sees [sic] how I venture to ramble about, not (I hope) through vain curiosity nor fleshly ease & security, but with my dear family & the numerous charge committed to us much in my thoughts, & being now & then enabled to commit them all to the Divine protection, & the mediation of the hand of Omnipotence. I doubt not but ye feel the want of me in several respects, however hope this excursion may prove of some benefit. I have hereby an opportunity of acquainting myself more perfectly with the general state of the society, & of knowing some families & individuals very well worth being known: My Son is under the necessity of coming more under the burden of the Business, which it is very incumbent on him to get Experience of in its [sic] various branches & circumstances he will see the absolute necessity there is of steadiness in his department & line of life, of close attention to the improvement of every pupil in every part of his learning & conduct, & how (under Providence) that is the main pillar of the house under which & by which we principally live: and above all, he will see that our best endeavours are as nothing without the sanction of the Divine blessing, & I trust even the Imbarrassments [sic] & Trials which he may additionally meet with in my absence will tend & conspire to strengthen a strong Cry in him for best Wisdom, which he must find on so many occasions that he greatly lacketh: On him thou knows, my Dearest, that our hopes are much fixed, as to outward, temporal view, being the only male Remainder of our house: If Religion has room to operate in its own way, manner & extent, in his heart, he will infallibly do well: if he suffers the mixture of the Creature to preponderate, the earthly in any shape to supersede the heavenly, & his Will & Choice to incline to the World, its spirit, & its wisdom, his progress in the holy path (a path replete with every solid comfort of this & a better life) will be greatly retarded or blocked up, & his future life disquieted with many a disagreeable alloy. But (thanks to that Power which has measurably preserved us, My Dear, as we kept in some degree our hold of its Chains, & which through [word crossed out] great, unmerited Kindness is, I trust, visiting our offspring) I am comforted in a belief that our Son will make the best choice, even choose wisdom of the best kind, & not only choose it, but with an holy importunity earnestly pray for it to be his Guide & safe guard [sic] through the intricate labyrinth & perils which may attend him in his short passage over the stage of this uncertain life so will the blessing of his dignified ancestors fall upon him, his morning & noon-day [word crossed out] sun shine with unclouded lustre, & its splendour illuminate the mild evening of his day. This, My Dear, is our earnest wish not only for him, but all our dear children. I hope they will each excuse my not writing to them: till this morning it has hardly been practicable for me with propriety to commune with you after this manner. Travelling, publick meetings, private opportunities, variety of feelings prevent the inclination & the capacity (the To will, & To do) from uniting.Leaving London 14th instant we took our passage in the stage-coach for Chelmsford (the residence of dear John Griffith.) We found the good man very poorly in health, his legs much swolen [sic], an Asthma & dropsy seemed to be precipitating him toward the grave; yet he [word crossed out] was remarkably communicative, pleasant, cheerful & agreeable, spoke very affectionately of thee, said he remembered thee & thy person quite freshly (I think he said) as if thou was there before him. I told him of thy love & esteem for him, my heart was united to him, I drew nigh to him as to a Father & most dear Friend, my spirit was tendered: he lived 2 or 3 days after we were gone from him, & then was gathered to the Generations of the Just. His Remains are to be interred 23rd instant. He commissioned me to present thee with his dear love. Samuel Neale, James Abell, William Forster, Johny [sic] Pim, William Dillworth & his wife ^&I^ were all there together, W:D: & wife, JA & I lodged at dear Johns, the rest at a friends house in the town. The dear man was below stairs with us in the evening, & though he had a very poor night, was down with us next morning. We had no opportunity but of conversation with him. We staid till about 11 oclock that morning: just about that time a stage-coach came in, which had just room for 3 passengers, we took leave in great love & great haste, & got safe here that evening (near 50 miles.) It is admirable what accommodation there is in carriages for Travellers, & how little thy make of running 60 or 80 or 100 miles. I often think of thee, & thy horse & chaise & Martin, my Love...This is the place from whence Robert Dudley got his last wife: he puts me in mind of a Fisherman, who with his foot-net goes to a secret corner, a hole under a Bank, from which he snugly & dextrously [sic] extracts a valuable prize...This is a very pleasant, quiet town, the people industrious, & several of them rich: small ships come up to it. The Friends exceedingly kind, & the most free & cordially intimate among one anothers families of any place (I think) that I have yet been in. Lissy & her Brother & Sister M are very friendly. We (i.e. our company, Samuel Neale, Jeremy Abell & I) lodge at the house of Benjamin Evens, the principal friend in the place, a numerous family, & from the head to the foot, parents & children, as fine, promising, engaging family as (I think) I ever saw in our society. Benjamins wife is publick, her husband a valuable steady Elder, very open-hearted & agreeable, their children very personable, & not only seem well-disposed & quite friend-like in their appearance & conduct, but a strong current of heavenly visitation (I am persuaded) runs powerfully & I trust effectually towards them. The eldest Son of the family is married to a very amiable, friend-like young woman, settled in this place, & has beautiful little children. We have attended many Meetings in this town, for Worship & discipline, generally to good satisfaction. Isaac Sharpless [?] & our dear friend Sam Neale have had good service. Mary Artis [?] lives in this place,
is in good esteem, poor in this world, but (I doubt not) rich in Faith: she is grown old, seemed much rejoiced to see S:N:, but not to know me, or remember any thing about us. however [sic], gave me some testimony of her unity, which was satisfactory to me! Ruth Follows was here, is hard of hearing, did not mix much in conversation, I was fearful lest she had any way suffered loss, she appeared low & somewhat distant; but at the conclusion of the yearly meeting here, removed all my fears respecting her, revived the ancient amity & unity between us, & baptized my spirit with a supplication so powerful, so extraordinary, & accompanied with such holy energy of Eloquence as I thought was enough to convince all Mankind, that could hear of it, of the Principle of Truth which we profess. She is travelling with certificate: I expect to meet her again at NorwichI hope before this thou will have received Dr Fothergills prescriptions which I delivered to Cousin Morris Birkbeck to forward to thee as he was writing to Ballitore. I got a friend (a Chymist) to make English of, & explain the Prescription for thy own satisfaction & use, which hope thou hast at same time received. I would have thee keep the Doctors own prescription. Our Tenant (Surgeon Johnson) its like may assist thee about it...M:B: has concluded on business (the making of Tin-foil for backs of looking-glasses, &c.) in company (I believe) with John Townsend & Thomas Wright the Kings Watch-maker: it is thought to be a safe & profitable business: he means to reside (I believe) within 10 or 14 miles of London. By his conversation with me & a Letter which I received from him here, I understand that he intends to lay his intentions of marriage before our ^next^ Meetings of discipline, but wanted me to write home that [word crossed out] ^they^ might be adjourned to the time of another week or two for his accommodation in that respect. I told him & since wrote in reply to him how disagreeable it was to me to be instrumental in introducing any innovation which might hereafter be claimed from such a precedent, improperly, as their right, by others. I advised him, as the interval between the ^next^ Meeting of discipline to which he belongs in Yorkshire & ours was so short as that there was [word crossed out] a danger lest he could not appear at the latter timely with proper credentials from the former, that he would, as soon as he pleased, get a Certificate of his being in unity with Society, signed by a few substantial friends, or by the preparative Meeting of Settle, & bring with him, which I believed our Meeting would make no objection to receiving in the present case: & I told him that I thought there was time enough for a correspondence on the occasion of Inquiry & Publication of their intentions (during the interval of the succeeding 6 weeks,) between the said two Meetings of discipline. I do not know whether this proposal will be satisfactory to him, though I know no reason why [word crossed out] it should not: but if he should write on the subject to Ballitore, & ye can do any thing for his convenience, I hope best Wisdom will direct your Prudence in the affair.I am in hopes to be at home with you before our next Mens Meeting, but as this is uncertain, & unstable winds & waves intervene, I thought proper to mention this matter. I believe there is no occasion to write to me to England after ye receive this: but I would be glad to hear of all your welfare at Dublin, by a letter to myself, or to our dear friend E: Pike.I suppose Joseph Pike returns by the North of England & Scotland, & that his Brother John Pim goes a part of the way with him, & sends his son Joseph over in company with his uncle...We have been 2 or 3 several nights at Tanners end, found & left them much as usual in health, met with the usual cordiality among them, & the usual good prospect concerning divers of them: our parting with them was rather affectingThe Quarterly Meeting of York I suppose is held at the same time, or near it, that the Yearly Meeting of Norwich is held this year; so that its not well practicable to be at bothI have not been (nor mean to be) at E: Burkes Country-seat: he is the same astonishing, bright luminary, the same affable, condescending companion, the same steady, faithful, cordial friend. His Wife, his Brother, his Son & W: Burke very kind & friendly. his [sic] Son a sweet, amiable, promising youth; I sent them a letter of Excuse for my abrupt departure. On the whole, their company (though I cultivated it as little as circumstances seemed to admit, & though it received that alloy of uneasy sensation which a religious mind generally feels as its guard in such company) did my best life no good; & yet in one of my best seasons since I came hither, Ned was much in my mind with earnest petition on his behalfI left with Cousin M: Birkbeck the care of getting some books & instruments packed up for me in London to be forwarded to Joseph Pike in Dublin. I am a very improper person to intrust with commissions, my memory is so treacherous, my mind so feeble, my understanding so little, my sight so bad, & I conceit (of late) my hearing so dull. however, I expect what is left of me will be very agreeable ^acceptable^ to you all, if Providence so continues his favour that we happily meet again. In the mean time, present me with much affection to thy sister, to my children, to Cousin Sally, to Sister Fuller & hers [sic], to the parlour-company, to the boys in general, Sally Wood & the servants, with my Neighbours ^Friends^ Benjamin & Jonathan Haughton, Andrew Wilson & their families, & all our neighbours & friends that inquire what is become of the old Master. Tell C: Keatings I got her watch from the Makers & would have sent it by Jemmy Luky [sic], but that the Maker (I was told) was in the country, & I could not get it, but hope to bring it safe as myself to Ballitore. Having wrote this Letter (without intermission almost) at one bout, thou may think I am almost weary of writing, though never I think of conversing with thee, whom the longer I have the favour of possessing, the more I loveRemember me to all our Clonmel Relations when hast opportunity. I wrote to Brother Grubb from London. Farewell, my Dear Love, & be assured I am, with increasing affection, thy
	truly loving husband

P.S. Our dear friend S:N & Jemmy Abell send their loveas also my kind hostess, & host.
