       											Ballitore: 21/4 month 1785


It is now a considerable time since I received my dear & esteemed friends kind and affectionate letter, which was very acceptable to me, & I should most probably have made reply to it sooner, but have been for some time past a good deal from home. [several words crossed out] I had made a little excursion to meet our dear friends Hannah Bevington & Sarah Stephenson, who were engaged in visiting families in some of our neighbouring communities as in other places. Their concern was not only to those who are in unity, but to such also as had any distant relations to our society, who would accept of their visit. I was in my small measure, a witness of their diligent faithful labours, & of the good power which accompanied them. ++
I accompanied our valuable friend Mehetabel Jenkins of New England from my house on her visit to some neighbouring meetings & families belonging to them. She is an humble, watchful, circumspect walker, & diligent in the exercise of an edifying, lively gift. I expect ye have heard that she got favorably through the small pox at our friend Samuel Neales near Cork. +++
I am concerned that thou & cousin Deborah have been each of you so much indisposed. She is young, & may yet have many conflicts of various kinds to encounter before she puts off her harness: I heartily wish her strength sufficient for the evil of every day - & that (if it be consistent with infinite wisdom) she may in this life see many happy & tranquil days - ^[pencil note] X^ And my desires are for us that are farther [page number] 281 advanced in age, that we may so run, as not uncertainly; so fight, not as one that beateth the air; but that feeling as we increase in years, after an increase of spiritual life we may have no confidence in the flesh, in natural talents or former religious experiences, but still waiting for the fresh anointing & the renewed putting forth, move in any little service according to the present qualification & ability given. It is a common saying that Very old men are twice children - May my dear & honoured friend, if we should arrive at that stage of life, experimentally know the renewal of the child's state, to which belongeth the kingdom; as new-born babes desiring the sincere milk of the word, that we may grow thereby. This is what preserves green & fruitful in old-age, & keeps from decay in root & branch: & this I trust is ^ will be thy renewed experience to the end of time.
       Whether I shall see it best to endeavour to get to the ensuing yearly meeting or not, I cannot yet say - I greatly desire to be preserved from over-doing & impertinently meddling as well as to be devoted in all my faculties (such as they are) to the promotion of the most glorious cause that ever existed.
       If ye were acquainted with my wife (& consequently, my wife acquainted with you) I am sure there would be be a reciprocation of mutual affectionate regard among you - the same with respect to my son & his wife. May we, through condescending mercy, be preserved to live wherem though absent in body, we shall at times be present in spirit, joined in heart to one another, & to all the living! I am, my dear friend, with grateful affection & true esteem.

       Thy sincere friend

Richard Shackleton
