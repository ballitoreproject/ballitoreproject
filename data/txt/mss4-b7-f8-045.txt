Waterford, Firstmonth 13th 1797
Dear Cousin
I had the pleasure of receiving thy
favour per Mark Lyons daughter to whom it
was not in my power to be of much service
she met with an acquaintance a daughter of
George Stacey who I thought likely to give her
every necessary information - as to her husband
I procured him a Certificate of his bearing a
good character in the Country from whence he
came which he said he would have seconded
by some Gentlemen for whom he worked - I suppose
he has got employment from a Country Gentleman
in the neighbourhood of Waterford. I was
not a little interested in your family concerns
I hope thy situation is comfortable - My little

family has not increased much of the prospect of
three my wife has only presented me with one
child who bears the name of my mother that is
the poetical name (Eliza) who has not yet completed
her second year - I should be happy to hear
my Aunt enjoyed good health - & the rest
of the connexions - This is intended per Mathew
Mooney formerly a Butcher in [unclear]Limdin[/unclear] now a
resident in Athy who came here to recover some
property left by a Son of his who died in
Newfoundland which he has this day got
I saw the Will in which a Legacy of Â£3.13.8
is left to a Catherine Jacob (I suppose) of [unclear]Timotin[/unclear]
it would be well perhaps to make inquiry some
time hence after that woman & if she be not
paid said Sum to direct her to apply to
Matthew Mooney who has administered to the
effects of the deceased - I was a good deal

surprised by an application from a person in a
Sailors dress a few days ago who was very
shabby & appeared in great distress - his features
under the disguise of filth were not entirely unknown
yet I could not recollect the name
of Trevor Fay until he told me who he was
I am afraid he is wedded to the vagrant
life & has given up all hope or ambition of
making a decent appearance. I ho[unclear] [/unclear]
account I some time ago received by [unclear]T Chandlee[/unclear]
distress was ill founded as M. Mooney says
he is going on very well - Present me affectionately
to all Friends & believe me
Sincerely thine
Wm Rayner
