 Ballina Sept 18/48
My dear Lucy
I little thought the
last time I saw you that I should
be located in this wild place, but
so it is, we little know what is before
us, and I believe we are all willing
to acknowledge that it is right we should
be kept in ignorance on that head.
As for myself, although I was very
unwilling at first to enter-upon this
undertaking yet I am beginning to look
on it in a more favorable light, and
if I could see my way clearly so as to
 bring it to any thing like a [deletion][/deletion] successful
conclusion, I dare say I could pass
a few months here pleasantly enough.
I find the gentry with whom I am
brought in contact uncommonly hospitable
and agreeable and [insertion]have been[/insertion] [deletion][/deletion] in no want of

invitations to breakfast, dinner,
and even a nights lodging since
my arrival amongst them.
The great drawback is the misery
I witness arising from the extreme
 poverty of the lower classes, misery
such as we who lived in Leinster
have no conception of. Just think
of the four women and girls [insertion]half clad[/insertion] working
in the fields from morning until night
 for three pence per-day and [insertion]in[/insertion] some
instances for so small a sum as two
pence, yet such is the case, and
now that they think I have the
power, they frequently follow me
along the roads begging of me
to give them work at the above
mentioned wretched rate of wages. What
their state will be when the winter
comes, and all the potatoes are gone,
God only knows, I often think it
would be well for them if they were
all in their graves.

Some of the crops of Turnips
and mangel we have here are
really astonishing considering the state
of the surrounding country, and
such as would do the heart of a
farmer like you all the good in the
world to see, but at same time
world to see, but at the same time
it is only right to mention they
cost a great deal of money, much
more than would pay any private person
to expend upon them.
There is no handsome scenery
immediately about this town, the
country being for the most part
flat, boggy, and destitute of trees
and altogether presenting a very bleak
appearance, and it is a bad place
for any one in search of the picturesque

to take up his quarters.
I wish you would give Frank
a scolding for keeping me up
so late the night before I left
Dublin, the consequence of which
was I was very near being late
for the train, and in fact I had not
two minutes to spare, tell him
also to bear in mind what he
said about coming to see me
here. Please give my love to
the children at least to those you
have with you and to the others
when you see them, also send
me a few lines that I may know
how you all are and you will
much oblige your affectionate
brother
Arthur B
Should you want any turnips I will let
you have some cheap, but then you must
pay the carriage.
