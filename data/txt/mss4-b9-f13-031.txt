Poor Deborah's birth day 31
My dearest Sarah
So thou hast really left us & I feel
so very lonesome that I am ready to scold thee for
consenting at all to leave me - but I wont my honey - I
will only hope that we may soon meet again in happiness
Ah! Sarah we must all be dear to each other, for in each
we meet a relic of our precious precious mother. We were
rejoiced to get thy letter bringing such good tidings. - Elizth
bade me thank thee for thy consideration in writing
so soon. - She sends Margaret's clothes by George. I
spent yesterday at my fathers. - Deborah came in &
was very agreeable & reasonable - I dont mean to insinuate
that she is ever mad. To day is wet & gloomy
which is delightful to father & he tells with great glee
of a fair day here which was so wet that the people
could not open their booths. Sarah Knott is returned
& she & aunt Sally are to accompany father to Rathany
[unclear]at [/unclear]5 o'clock tomorrow morning - I am at the [unclear][/unclear]
we are very pleasant - but I miss thee & Betsy.
My dear love to Edward I hope he will return "hale
& well & living" & I hope soon to see you here or
there. Mary says that she thinks thou hast a bedgown
of Betsy's but if thou cannot find it - dont
fret. We were quite lonely without Margo. I
have no fresh news from [unclear]Limbo[/unclear] Lake. I was
reading Betsy's memoir of my mother & of all I have
seen it pleased & soothed me the most. - ah she knew
her well & valued her highly & I believe was always
tender & loving to her. I hope thou wilt write soon
& tell us how the children are when they have recovered
their fatigue. do now. I had no idea of aunt
Chambers's being so severely hurt until I read Betsy's

last letter give my dear love to Betsy. I regret the
necessity of her absence. How wonderfully kind all
are! Farewell! affectionately my dear Sarah
Thy LJ Fisher
Elizth & I are to be occupied tomorrow in
looking over papers & arranging them - a melancholy task
& yet I think of it with pleasure. I have not seen [unclear]Dick[/unclear]
since & I almost dread him - for my not going to
Kilkea. My aunt Lydia desires me to give thee her
dear love & to tell thee that she regrets greatly being
so occupied with the colliers & to have rendered it
impossible to pay thee the attention she would have
wished. She is anxious & will be so until she hears
how Willie is. The Ghost appeared the night before last
so saith one of my oracles on that subject y'clept
Thomas Linton. Thou sees I am busy still with this
object Enter dinner so exit Lydia.
