Dear Mrs Davis
I am very sorry for
the cross which has brought
about our acquaintance and
we shall remember you before
the throne of peace. I was very
fond of your dear husband
to remember our work for the
Master. The subscription
will have to appear in the

annual Report. It is now entered
in the books as from Mrs
Davis [unclear]Fonrock[/unclear]. If you should
wish it to appear otherwise
kindly let me know
the Lord bless & keep you
Yours very gratefully
Thomas Connellan
