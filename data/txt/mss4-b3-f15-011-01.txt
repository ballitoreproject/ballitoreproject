Ballitore: 24th of 12th month 1780

My dear friend,
+++ I have thought a good deal of late of the organization of our frame, and how easily the understanding may be confused and disordered by the minds dwelling too intensely on one object, either of pleasure or pain or desires [?] - My beloved friend, may the Great Architect, whose wonderful mechanism we are, be graciously pleased to preserve us, and sanctify us in body, soul and spirit, keep us in the safe path of mediocrity, at a due distance from the precipices which are on both sides of us our way, walking humbly in his fear, as owing our reason and every other gift, natural and spiritual to his Providence, and crown the end of our weary pilgrimage with Peace!
