[pencil note] [13 July, 1764] 


Dear Cousin R. Shackleton/
        I received thy very acceptable Letter, & must gratefully acknowledge thy obliging Condesension [sic] in taking such pains (as thou kindly writes) to make me acquainted with you all; I was much affected with some parts of it, I should be sorry to have an unfeeling Heart, but it gave me great satisfaction to find that the Children of thy first Wife, who lost so valuable a Parent in their tender years, should happily fall into the hands of a second Mother so formd to supply that loss both by Example & maternal Care & Tenderness; I coud ^not^ but sympathize with thee & thy worthy spouse on the Loss of your little son, it must be a pinching Trial to tender hearted Parents  Cousin Anna Geldart has had a very tedious Ilness [sic], but contrary to general Expectation, she is again so well recoverd as to be able to go to Meetings, tho very feeble & weak still - She desired her dear Love to you all. I hope thy Father got well home, I was very glad to see him, I coud have wishd his stay with us longer; he came so unexpectedly I was quite unprepared (I think never more so), to receive such a Stranger, for which I was heartily vexd both then & since  & I was more concernd on another Account too, for I coud [sic] not but reflect it must give him great Concern to find my Brother & me in a situation so different from what we might & ought to have been in 
My husband is at present abroad, myself & little ones still mercifully favourd with good Health - Im very desirous of a Line from thy Father & thee when time & freedom permits, I shoud be sorry to drop a correspondence so valuable, I know Im unworthy of the Favour from either of you, but I may honestly say I find ^something^ in each of your Letters which reaches the Witness in my own Breast, & I hope, at least for a time, does me some good may your pious wishes for me, & kind Endeavours to point out the right Way to my bewilderd Soul be not entirely lost - My poor Brother is much out of Order he has very poor Health, & greatly perplexd with the Business ^which^ contrary to his own Inclination he has sufferd himself to be involvd in - George Andrew desires his dear Love to thy Father & is extremely sorry he shoud ^not^ have the pleasure of seeing him he was then abroad & did not return till after thy Father was gone  My sister Sally spent a few Days with me lately, she desired (when I writ) her dear Love to you all - I often think of all my kind Friends at Ballitore & cant but pity thee & my Cousin [2 words crossed out] on the Account of your great Business being well assured it must necessarily be attended with a Fatigue almost insupportable [3 words crossed out] Im very glad your Children are hopeful they will I hope eer [sic] long help to alleviate your Burthen & take some part of the Care & trouble off your hands  - my very dear Love attends thy Father, & Mother, Aunt, self, Spouse & Children from thy affectionate Kinswoman Elizabeth Dale


Skipton 7 month 13th 1764 
P.S. please to give my kind Love to Cousin Rayner when hast an Opportunity & when thou writes again be pleased to let me know how she is  Thy Letter was not chargd if it had shoud have been far from begrudging the postage, I beg thoult not deprive me of the pleasure of hearing from you (as often as is convenient) on that Account.
