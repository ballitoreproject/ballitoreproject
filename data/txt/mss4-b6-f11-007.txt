My dear friend
I received your kindly
sympathetic note, for
which I felt truly obliged -
There are some things we
never tire of hearing repeated
again & again -
such is the favourable
opinions of our friends, of
those we love & venerate
& I have a melancholy
pleasure in knowing how
general was the estimation
in which my father
Why should not I bear with them for my
short hour? It is a great comfort to me
in this present season of illness & debility
that I have carefully settled my creed in
health - I am free from the gloom of superstition
& the equally gloomy notion of annihilation -
I speculate not on the mode
or manner of a future state till death
shall remove the veil, & I receive additional
senses - In the meantime I hold with
[unclear]Roscoe[/unclear] that - that is
Frail child of earth, high heir of heaven" -

was held. All felt that
for integrity, unbending,
principles, private & public
benevolence &c sincere
love of truth & ardent
& unabating search after
it, none could exceed my
father - & he died as he
had lived full of confidence
in the rectitude of those
opinions he had formed
in health. He "surveyed
both [unclear]worlds[/unclear] intrepid &
[unclear]entire[/unclear]" & he was dismayed
not at [insertion]the prospect of[/insertion] death - Nay he
looked forward to it with
a degree of pleasure -
In the last letter I had from
him, he says, after giving
his opinion on the recent
[underline]Catholic miracles[/underline], " I am
not annoyed by persons,
who choose to envelope
themselves in the thick
mists of superstition, nor
by those who please their
fancies by the [unclear][/unclear]
corruscations of ultra scepticism.
I have settled my
creed, remote from both extremes,
that according to Jeremy
Taylor's apolouge or [unclear][/unclear]
modernized by Dr. Franklin, since
the great directing power of the
Universe bears with all vanities
I am conscious, my dear friend, this long
notes require an apology, but the [underline]subject[/underline]
must plead my excuse -
I wrote to Betsy Shackleton requesting
to hear if you had further accounts
of Deborah, but I have just heard she
is gone with Eben to Cheltenham - I feel
very anxious about Deborah, & may I
beg you to favour me with a few lines
when you hear how she gets on -
& please give me Eben's address as
Samuel wishes to write to him. I
had a long & most affectionate letter
from my dear Lydia a few days ago,
but I suppose you had letters of a later
date - Give my love to Elizabeth &
your [unclear][/unclear]L & believe me your affectionate
S Haughton
