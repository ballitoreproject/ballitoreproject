Helen Gillies's 2 Hay's-street Edinburgh 4th Mo. 5th 1821.-
Thomas Fisher to Sarah Leadbeater.-
I received thy acceptable letter dated, "by adjournments from the 18th of 2nd month,
to the 15th of 3rd inclusive." - which letter was the first to inform me [insertion]either[/insertion] of Eben's illness.
& or recovery. -
I am glad that any thing in any of my letters should delight Suliot - he
says that my eyes are opening - I answer that if they are, it is to the defects
& not to the excellencies of the Scotch character - I should indeed be sorry to
brand a whole nation with the faults of a few - but I do not conceive toryism
to be merely the fault of a few - else why should where be but one consistent
& open Whig newspaper in all Scotland - if a free press speaks the sentiments of
a country then surely we cannot call Caledonia the land of Whiggism.
I was sorry to hear of the sensation which the sentiments of the free
press of Ballitore [deletion]comm[/deletion] excited among the orthodox - that is among the tories,
the friends of the Emperor of Austria, & the enemies of free discussion - I hope
however no severe measures were [deletion]acted upon[/deletion] enforced in consequence, - as it
has been rumoured that the school was diminishing, - & [insertion]that[/insertion] Suliot was about to
leave it - this I heard from Mary Dawson [underline]as a rumour[/underline] - but I sincerely
hope it has no foundation - for my part I am inclined to believe in both of
the doctrines which have given offence - tho' there are a few parts of the
papers on Instinct on which I cannot altogether agree with this ingenious
author - No; I have never read any of the writings of Chateaubriand but
I should like to do so - Deborah's remark that he must have Christianity
in full dress - does not however prepossess me much in his favour - Christianity
has been so much concealed & [unclear]deformed[/unclear] by the numerous garments in which various
sects have attired her - that is is rare to find an author who represents her in
her native [deletion]attire[/deletion] [insertion]garb[/insertion] - if Fenelon's mind had been vigorous enough to have shaken
off the trammels of authority, - he would perhaps have succeeded in drawing such a
portrait - if we may judge from the many charming glimpses which [deletion]we are[/deletion] [insertion]he[/insertion] enable[deletion]d[/deletion][insertion]s[/insertion]
us to take under the half-uncovered veil of Popery -
Thou hast not yet reconciled me to R. L. Edgeworth's vanity - & I cannot
think with thee that [deletion]set[/deletion] the omission of many little circumstances which possess no
interest but as they are connected with himself - would have diminished his faithfulness
as a historian; - in any biography, a minute account of interesting circumstances
is tedious - but in [underline]auto[/underline]biography, - it is disgusting. - I agree with thee however
that the Quarterly Reviewers have injured their own character (if that be not already
But, to return to Gregory - he was certainly [deletion]one[/deletion] [insertion]a man[/insertion] of the first rank, a star of the first magnitude - I attended his class both last year
& the present - his nephew Dr. Alison has been lecturing for him since Christmas, & we are delighted with him & think none so worthy
to supply the place of his revered uncle - we (his class) met the other day & unanimously agreed to present him with an address
expressive of our thanks for his kindness in [insertion]delivering the lectures[/insertion] [deletion]lecturing[/deletion] & admiration at the talents & industry shown in their composition - This, we
hope, may do something for him - but alas! he has no interest in the town-council who have the election of professors, - he has never
made himself the tool of the tories & therefore has but a poor chance. - Dr. Gregory's funeral was attended by his late class, & the
Medical & Physical Societies, who went in processions - I walked with the Medical Society -
I have had a letter lately from my brother James - in which he is as usual indignant against the Holy Alliance - He mentions
having received a long letter from Suliot, commencing a correspondence with him - would that I were so favoured -
23rd Since I wrote the above I had an interesting letter from Edward Alexander, in which he endeavours to persuade me
that Whiggism must soon prevail in Scotland - his arguments have not quite convinced me but I hope he may be right -
He mentions having attended the Mountmelick meeting & then paid you a visit, of which he gives me a particular account -
Deborah, he says, looked better than he expected, & from thee he received "the warm welcome of the olden times." - He tells me that
Lydia has an answer to my letter nearly ready, - I hope I may soon receive it - She will be at the Yearly Meeting, of course -
This night week, I went with John Ruckman & Thomas Hodgkin to a meeting of the Royal Society here, at which
we were very much interested. - Sir Walter Scott (who is president) was not there - but in his place Mackenzie, auther of the
Men of Feeling, presided. - He is an old man - but he surprised & delighted me with the liveliness & animation of his
remarks - a paper had been read giving a biographical account of the late Dr. Cullen - when it was finished he entered into
it at once & [deletion]spoke of its bringing[/deletion] [insertion]said it brought[/insertion] him back to old times - spoke of his memory for recent events being very much impaired -
but those of his younger days was still fresh - compared himself to a bridge between last century & the present - & made several

below all injury) [deletion]by th[/deletion] more than R. L. Edgeworth's by their representation of it. But
I think Maria should have taken some notice of her mother. I think thou seems tacitly
to acknowledge the [deletion]exhibition[/deletion] offensiveness of R. L. E.'s vanity, when thou allegest as a ground of thy preference
of the 2nd volume to the 1st that "it is pleasanter to hear the praise of a father by his
daughter than by himself."
Thou kindly enquires how I came off as to my resignation [insertion]as a member of the apparatus committee[/insertion] - I have to inform
thee that I wrote my resignation, took it to the society & - had not courage to
[deletion]give it in[/deletion] [insertion]present it[/insertion]. - However, I am not sorry for it now, as I found it a much easier
job than I expected, we, the committee, having little else to do than meet
& drink tea together twice a month, which I found very pleasant - I cannot
say that it is for honour that I am elected for I believe it was due only to
fill up the situation, but it is generally considered as an honour to be on a
committee, & some are very ambitious for it. - Our household are as well as usual.
Mrs. Gillies is [deletion]now[/deletion] pretty tranquil about the Queen at present, but has interested
herself since about the poor Neapolitans. - Dr. Morton does not lodge in
the house with [deletion]thee[/deletion] me; he lodges in College-street. The Rickmans are very well -
John R. & I are to take a walk to the Pentland hills together on Good
Friday, if it be fine - he sends me "the Times" regularly, which he gets from
London, so that I have all the news & the Parliamentary debates - our good
landlady is [deletion]also[/deletion] very much interested [insertion]also[/insertion] in favour of the Catholics. - Anne
Cruickshank's children have [deletion]ha[/deletion] just got through the measles - Thomas
Hodgkin attended them, but I believe I have not introduced thee to him
yet - he is a very agreeable plain young friend from London, & is possessed
of a treasure of useful information, particularly on medicine, he is come
here to attend the medical lectures - but he is quite wrong about political
economy & I want him to read Adam Smith - . he objects to the use of
machinery as throwing labourers out of employment, & he is full of Owen's
plan - John Rickman & I did all we could to bring him over to the
[underline]right[/underline] side one night but all in vain. - but I have been telling him that
I was [deletion]just[/deletion] [insertion]wrong[/insertion] like him until I had read Adam Smith. - I have not
seen Captain Ramage lately - & do not know his children. - Did Edward
Alexander attend George Bewley's wedding & afterwards pay you his
promised visit? - Oh! yes, I [underline]was[/underline] delighted with J Bonham's verses
on the boat & so was Henry Gaulter - poor Henry - the day before he
judicious observations, on the biography of great men - & all this in a most interesting & animated manner - I am
sure I could not have been more interested if it had been the great Bard himself who had occupied the chair.
Last sixth-day, being good Friday, - John Rickman, Thomas Hodgkins, Joseph Miller, Joseph [unclear]Ware[/unclear] (a young man
from Bristol) & myself, according to previous agreement, set out together on a walk to the Pentland hills which are
situated about 5 miles to the south of this. - We could not have had a finer day, if we had our pick & choice
out of the whole year - we had a most delightful view of this metropolis - of the Firth of Forth, of the opposite
coast of Fife, - of Arthur's seat - & in short of the whole surrounding scenery - it was the richest specimen of Scotch
scenery which I have yet seen - & the [deletion]day[/deletion] appearance of the day added much to its effect - it being one of those
delightful enlivening spring-days, [insertion]which are so common in this month[/insertion] on which we see the shadows of clouds chasing each other in rapid succession over
the face of a sun-illumined country - We all returned highly gratified with our excursion &[deletion]spent the[/deletion] dined & spent
the evening at John Rickman's. -
26. I received this morning a long, & as usual, most welcome letter from my indefatigable correspondent & constant friend, thy
sister Lydia. I intend to buy a sheet of paper this evening to begin a reply [deletion]with[/deletion] [insertion]upon[/insertion]. I was very glad to [deletion]hear[/deletion] [insertion]receive[/insertion] from her a favourable
account of thy sister Deborah - She mentions having received a message from thee to deliver & forgotten it - it is not
[deletion]to[/deletion] every one that I could forgive such forgetfulness - but to me who so seldom forgets, I cannot refuse a pardon - I hope however
to receive the message soon from the fountain-head. - I must now leave thee for her, & do not know whether I shall return to
thee in this letter or not - so for the present I bid thee affectionately Farewell. -
4th of 6th Month - I must apologize to thee for sending thee so stale a letter - but of the two evils - that of charging thee with postage, & sending

left Edinburgh, he showed me some beautiful verses addressed by a son of Sheridan's
to his [insertion](H.G's)[/insertion] wife, - of whom I had never heard him speak before. She was a niece
of Sheridan's. - There has been no account from him that I have heard of as yet -
he is gone to a country in which the public are a good deal interested at present -
but I am afraid the poor Neapolitans must yield. - I should like very much to
have a letter from Henry Gaulter, but I did not offer to correspond with him, as I knew
I could send him nothing interesting in return.
I [insertion]must[/insertion] acknowledge that I said little for the Scotch in what I sent thee in my last letter,
but I think I said as much as I could for them. - I consider the character of the
Irish as a complete contrast to that of the Scotch, they have what the Scotch want, &
they want what the Scotch have - there are some good remarks on the different characters
of both nations in the article on Ireland in the last Edinburgh Review. - I fully
intend to visit the highlands before I leave Scotland.
12th Anne Miller (Elizabeth's mother) resembles thy mother in her liberality
of mind, & simplicity of character - & perhaps I may say, in her fondness
for Cowper - but she has not had the advantages of thy mother's education, & even
if she had, I don't think she has a mind [insertion]so[/insertion] capable of deriving profit &
pleasure from it & imparting them to others. - I do not think she
could ever have written a poem - & am inclined to doubt whether she
would have made a good biographer of Irish friends. - I do not think
Joseph Miller is very tiresome in conversation, - it is true he is not a companion
that I should choose to spend [deletion]the[/deletion] [insertion]a[/insertion] day with alone - but in his father's family
there is so much variety that one never feels tired of any of them. - I have spent
many long & very pleasant evenings there, - particularly when George was in good-
humour. -
From the tone of Edward Barrington's remarks on the New Education Society,
it did not strike me that he [deletion]was[/deletion] [insertion]judged[/insertion] very favourably of the results which were
to arise from it - he said it would form "a new era in the annals of priestcraft,
when its practices endeavour warmly to lessen their own influence" - Yes,
I have Bacon's essays - what about them? -
13 - The medical world & this university in particular have recently suffered
a severe loss in the death of Dr. Gregory, Professor of the Practice of Physic, -
which took place about 10 days ago - it will not be easy, perhaps impossible
to supply his place - indeed the sages of Caledonia are perishing fast, her
glory is departing, & when we look around we see few likely to maintain
it - but Scotia, ungrateful land! thou deservest not great men - many
of thy sons would gladly poison them all, as the Athenians did Socrates -
thee a letter a little old - I chose the latter evil as the least - it has however been made a little more ancient than I expected by Dr. Morton's
protracted delay in the highlands from whence he has just returned - He goes to-morrow & I send this by him. - Write soon & don't keep thy letters so long as I
have done mine. Again Farewell. - I have heard Chalmers - Mary S. will tell thee about him, & Lydia will tell thee of my visit to
Lanark. -
