[unclear][/unclear]ost chaise. an account coming of Wm. James's decease
most of our company, I expect, go to the funeral
tomorrow. 6th. James Harford in the chair with S:T,
& John Lury with his daughter, accompanied by
several friends from Pontipool, set out to attend
the funeral. a chaise was ordered for Elizth. Sophia
& me, against one O'Clock, but not coming
at the time appointed, it was between three &
four when we got away: John Harford, James's
son, & to whose home we were going, was with
us: - the horses look'd bad, & on the way we
changed them for other poor two, which we hoped
were better. Within a few miles of Cardiff the
chaise-boy informed us one of the springs were
broke, so [insertion]we[/insertion] went very slowly, & walked a little at
entering into town, - & nicely met John Harford,
who was just leaving it for his home, but had
kindly called on a Dr. about my poor arm: - we
had intended getting fresh chaise & horses &
proceeding, but when the Dr looked at, & felt my
arm, he pronounced the small bone in it broke,
& that it was highly improper to go farther
that night. So we staid there 22 miles from
Pontipool, & lodg'd at an inn. 7th,. Came to breakfast
