Clonmel 4th of 1st month 1777

My dear Father,

	Gladly I received thy acceptable letter this morning, I think you rather trespassed on your Bodies to ride to Kilkenny without baiting. Wherever thy lot is cast it seems thou finds work to be done & no doubt what ever thy hands find to do ^thou^ does it with all thy might; many offices in the Church appear to want those capable of discharging them, so that it may well be said How doth the City sit solitary that was full of people. almost [sic] in every place I believe there is deficiency & weakness: yet, though it may be the case, I do not know whether it becomes me to remark it, abournding so much with infirmities myself, & so far short of what I hope to attain to ere now; silly Harry Pemberton knows not what he is bartering, I wish poor Molly may be enabled to walk steadily. I admire at Hannah Pagans continuance she is a happy being, who has measurably walked before her Creator as Abraham was commanded, & therefore need not fear the approach of Death. I do not recollect our having much if any appearance of snow here. It was a great favour to find the family well, doubtless they rejoiced to see thee, I regret thou did not stay longer as the weather has proved moderate. I am pleased Cousin Hannah is with my poor Aunt, who is cheered with her company, my dear love is to Cousin Hannah, also Cousin Abby [?] when hast opportunity, I wish my silence may not create any jealous surmises. I observe what thou says of Samuel Neals letter, & thy reply, thou art as likely to be honoured with preferment as others, but thou looks not for high things. It is a weighty matter to leave ones family (especially such as thine) for long continuance, but thou hast great cause to have hope & faith in the highest power if thou apprehended ^it^ right to go. Betty Pims letter would feed one with expectation of poor Brothers obtaining the prize, if her Father was not a Man of so singular a character, that it is hard to comprehend him & his actions, I think then it seems a very dubious affair, I perceive Brother has been making use of that mollifying subject, his distress & anxiety, & perhaps it may have prevailed in degree to work on Sallys heart. tomorrow [sic] when Father is in town I purpose communicating that part of thy letter to him, I was busy to day or else should not have delayed till tomorrow informing Mother of it, but the days are so short I knew I should lose it, if I went to Mother this morning, Mother is so kind tis hard to leave her abruptly, Cousin Birbecks [sic] are long in settling, this must be disagreeable I think to Sally, only that all he does is the contrary. Poor John^n^y Pim has been very poorly. It is a great favour that thou canst write so well by candle light: I hope thou wilt be tender of overdoing thy eyes.
	Sam & I would be sorry Mother should be distressed on account of the butter, last 5th day he dispatched two good Casks to her, & wrote with them perhaps a shorter epistle than the other, thy apologetick postscript was quite unnecessary, if any thing offended him it was that, to hink him so w^e^ak as to take offence at it.
	I intend delivering thy love & apology to Aunt Taylor, who I think will be pleased with both: & also thy love ^to^ all thou mentions having it given to. Molly Roberts has already received it, she was here this morning & informed me her Mother could not possibly spare either of her sisters, unless by distressing herself, so that is off: & I am not as yet uneasy about a servant, I believe I could get some ignorant young Women of our Society, but it is not such I want, & till some one that would be really useful offers (if ever that happens) I should like to keep myself disengaged & do with such as I could get near ^home, & put away when I liked, girls that want much instruction & information are fitter for old Housekeepers: if I was capable of & equal to it I should (I believe) think it a pleasing & laudable task. I wrote thee a few lines last 5th day, & finding no frank, sent it without, I mentioned Brother Roberts desire to know whether Mother would have the feathers got at 13 s. [?] per stone, & now repeat it, lest the former letter should miscarry. My dear love & duty joined by my Husband to thee Mother & Aunt, I hope my poor Aunt is not uneasy at my not writing to her lately I hope to do it soon. Our dear love is to our Brother, sisters & Cousins. Jack says he gave thee thy Buckels [sic] with thy shoes, I did not find them about the house& am thy dutiful & affectionate Daughter M Grubb
