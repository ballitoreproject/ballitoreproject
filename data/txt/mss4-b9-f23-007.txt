My dear Sarah
Since I received thine
last week I have been casting about
and making enquiry concerning what
servants are to be had at present, in
the first place. I think Biddy Callaghan
was so stiff the last time thou wished
to get her that thou would not be likely
to have much satisfaction of her, but
however if thou would wish to make another
trial I will send for her - she is
still with her father - Biddy Doyle has
not got a place yet as nurse or servant,
but is living among her friends, quite deserted
by her husband and I dare say
would be glad to hear of a place - but
there is a young woman of the name of
Anne Toole wanting a place that I think
would answer thee better, she left the
Doctors some time since, lived there [unclear][/unclear]
if the American friends are more orthodox than
the English he must be most like an American
friend - thy aunt is finely, was at Meeting to-day
for the first time, Betsy and myself also, where we
had not been for months, Elizabeth out in the evening.
old crony Lydia, accompanies by two nice little
frocks for Anne, who is thriving and begins to
take notice - I suppose thou will soon have
the pleasure of Deborah's company - When will
we see any of you down here, perhaps when Edward
is stout enough, he may stray down to fish followed
by my dear Sarah and the [unclear]gorlaghs[/unclear] whose bonny
faces I long to see. With love joined by
Mary thy very affectionate
Ellen had a very pleasant note from her
A Wright

than servants in general, and I believe
parted on better terms, she is a mild, pleasing
looking girl, I know of several others, but
none I think very desirable, I am sorry
Rose is leaving thee - It is almost
time to mention poor Richard, but expect
ere this thou art relieved of all anxiety on
his account, he is getting on very well
notwithstanding that he still rambles a
deal, but today has had less of [deletion]that[/deletion] [insertion]it[/insertion] than
usual, his appetite is pretty keen, and he
rests well, can bear to be up for several
hours, and is not so very weak as one might
expect, I believe it is not uncommon for
the head to be unsettled for some time
after such an illness, we have heard
of several similar cases. Thomas Linton
is finely I expect to send this by his sister
who is to leave this to-morrow -
They are but poorly at the school, fifteen
ill in all there, one in measles,
little Elizabeth is most heavily attacked
4th day - Richard had a good night and
seems finely today, but the Doctor thinks it
necessary to have his head shaved again, the
rambling continues so long.

Sally Wilson is also in a trying way,
her lungs are very much affected, it is a
great matter that it is a short fever,
about 7 days the Doctor thinks.
Kelly the priest died yesterday, which
has caused great commotion in the neighborhood,
his illness was short, I believe
gout. Thy father seems quite well
and very brisk, he rode to Moore this
evening and overtook me on my way
home from Free Park, my poor uncle
[unclear]gaily[/unclear], he looks very thin, but [insertion]can[/insertion] move [unclear]about[/unclear]
and is able to be up nearly all [unclear]day[/unclear].
My Aunt the old 6/8 with the hat thou
may remember, sin byne, and all the other
[unclear][/unclear] milking, she is getting up her spirits
again about my uncle. Dear Betsy
here still indefatigable in attention to
poor Richard - Elizabeth too has gone
through great fatigue, and very unfit for
sitting up so much, green after her own
severe illness - Richard speaks in the most
orderly tone of voice thy Aunt Sally says
