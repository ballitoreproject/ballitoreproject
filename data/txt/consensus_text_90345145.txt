Deborah there. Ellen and Polly
left us at about 1½, and D and I
staid till nearly 2½ -. it was
very pleasant roaming about with
her. She dined with us and
the three of us spent the evening
at Trafalgar Terrace where we met
the Calverts and a Miss Southall
a pleasant lively English girl who
is spending awhile with Florence.
Grandmama was also there. Charlie
was the only bachelor, and looked
lonely enough among so many
young ladies. We played several
games and spent a very pleasant
evening.
