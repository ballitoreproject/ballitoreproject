Clonmel 29/4 month 1781

My dear Father,

	I am afraid thou hast been uneasy at my being so tedious in replying to thy last kind intelligent epistle I thought often to have wrote, but intervening occurrences as often frustrated my intention; I wrote to my Brother just before the receipt of thy last, & mentioned several things which thou writes of, amongst other subjects that affecting one of the decease of Mary Dickinson, her loss will be sorrowfully felt by many, sister John was the first informed me of the event; I communicated to her the information thou gives relative to their family. I do not remember talking much of thy having [word crossed out] ^a^ view of going this Year to London, Molly Dudley told me she heard it in Limerick, I think thou did not say much to me about it.
	I have looked with pleasure at the prospect of seeing you in Ballitore ere long, but ^the^ accomplishment seems uncertain, Molly Dudley, Molly Gayner & I had a Carriage engaged, & expected to be with you about dinner time on fifth day next, of which I meant to inform you, but an unforeseen accident has rendered this improbable, which I intend to relate: Molly Dudley sent to me yesterday morning desiring my company to take the air with her in their post-chaise, accordingly I went, & we proceeded towards two-mile bridge, the driver only in company, when we were about a mile from this town the Horses took Head, & ran away with us, the Man exerting all his might to little purpose to abate their speed; they ran for about a mile, when the driver threw himself off between the Horses, hopping to have more power of their heads, but the reins sliping [sic] out of his hands, the Carriage went over him & he coming out between the wheels received little hurt, but when we saw ourselves deprived of this only outward help our distress was great, Molly asked me should we leap out, I said I believed not, however she opened the door at her side & sprang out, we were then near the bridge, I did not know what to do, I expected the carriage should overset on the bridge & I should inevitably perish, I essayed to leap out, but was afraid, & the horses in full speed, but a girl at the turn-pike gate Providentially shut the gate against them, upon which they gave a sudden turn towards Brother Johns Mill, one of them I think fell down, & the Carriage instantly stoped [sic], I then got out, & a croud [sic] of people about me, & enquired for poor Molly; they were taking her up off the road greatly hurt, she imagined a leg & arm were broke, as the wheel of the Carriage went over her leg, but on examination it appeared it was not broke but extremely bru^i^sed, we got Brother Johns chair, & with difficulty got her to town, in great agony from her Shoulder principally, which the Doctor said was out, & which he says he slipt [sic] in, but she complains of great pain still in this arm lies in bed, & is feverish & ill otherwise; I hope she will not materially suffer, yet fear her recovery will be tedious it is a disappointment to her not to get to Dublin, she used to say to me the prospect about ^it^ was clo^u^dy, but we little thought this was before us, Robert talks if she be fit to leave to take her seat in the Chaise with M: Gayner & me, Do break this gently to my Mother, lest she be too much shocked, its [sic] like she would hear it by other means if I concealed it, it need not encrease [sic] her timidity, as one of those horses was unaccustomed to draw a Carriage, & had a habit of taking head & running away, which we were ignorant of, but her Husband is to blame tho he would not bear to have it said so: yet I cannot but admire at him as he knew the temper of the Beast. I did not receive the least hurt that I know of, except the dreadful shock, which I hope has not been productive of any bad consequence to me, may it excite grateful emotions for such a remarkable preservation, it is marvellous that Molly Dudley was not torn to pieces as she seemed to hang by the door of the Carriage after she leaped out looking in at me with a look of anguish, she told me since, she wanted to tear me out with her, I find also that when she fell it was on a dung-hill, which helped I supposed to break the fall, & also helped to preserve her leg from being broke.
	We are concerned for poor Jo & Molly Garrats affliction in the loss of their fine little boy, who we hear is deceased, suppose you have heard of poor Dinah Goffs removal by the measles.
30th Molly Dudley seems to be better to day, though still very poorly, she requests you will not blame her Husband about the Horse.
	I conclude with our dear love your
		dutiful & affectionate daughter
