It is proposed to raise a fund, [deletion]subscriptions[/deletion] [insertion]by subscriptions[/insertion]
[deletion]amounting at least to Five pounds per[/deletion]
annum[deletion][/deletion] to encourage by premiums of articles
of clothing, the attendance of children at the
Daily Schools.
As soon as an adequate [deletion]number[/deletion] [insertion]amount[/insertion] of subscriptions
is [insertion]is[/insertion] [deletion]are[/deletion] obtained the outlines of the plan are to
be circulated amongst the children & their
parents.
At the expiration of the year a meeting
of the subscribers is to be convened for the purpose
of arranging the scale of premiums, which will
be governed solely by the regularity & constancy
of attendance at School.
A double advantage is expected from the
application of this fund. It will supply
clothes to many children whose parents find
it difficult to provide them, and it will encourage
a regular attendance at School.
This mode of affording clothes to the poor
offers premiums for diligence, and promotes
cleanliness neatness & care.
