Dear Molly
I received thy letter last 4th
day which gave me great pleasure
& I can assure thee that a correspondence
ence with thee would give me great
pleasure (as it doth) if I knew how
to write a letter but do not think
by this that I have a mind to break
the correspondence for thats the least
of my thoughts.
As for omitting writing on one
side of my last, I beg pardon for I
did not know but I was greatly surprized
that it held no more than it did
prized that it held no more than it did
I am afraid that I wont get
the books at all for Black told me
that Sam Bradstreet wrote to him
or told him I cant tell which when he
was at home that he forgot the names
of the books but at any rate when
Mitchell writes to him Ill tell him
that they are not at Jacksons.

Concluded from our last.
Thus did the beautiful Insensible
her hopeless sister & despairing lover
unwillingly continue to torment each
other till one ill fated day put a final
period to all Uncertainty& vain dependance.
The Winds grew every moment higher &
The Gentleman had lately bought a
little pinnace beautifully ornamented
& fitted up for pleasure to this he invited
the two sisters with several other ladies
& Gentlemen who lived near the sea side
in order to give them a regale on board The
Weather being calm & clear when they set out
tempted them to sail a considerable distance
tance from shore when all at once the aspect
of the Heavens was changed & from a most
severe sky became clouded & tempestuous
blew so strong against them, that in spite
of their intention they were borne [deletion]out[/deletion] still
farther out at sea - The storm increasing
the Vessel being weak, & as some say the
Marines unskilful it bulg'd against
a rock & split at the bottom - the [unclear][/unclear]

a moment between the accident & sinking -
the circumstances admitted no time for consideration

his grasp of one in order to save the other on
which following the emotions of his gratitude
rather than his love he let go the older of these
[unclear][/unclear] & swam with the younger till he
reached the shore - One of the Sailors who had
none under his protection saw the Distress of her
whom her lover had left floating & catchd hold of her
garments just as she was sinking but destiny
everyone was in the utmost consternation
forbad success to his endeavours a [unclear]billow[/unclear] too
large & boistrous for human skill or strength
to cope with came rolling oer them both & plunged
this unfortunate Lady with her intended delivered
in the immense Abyss - Her lover who had just
easd himself of his [unclear]burden [/unclear] beheld from shore what
eased himself of his burden beheld from shore what
had befallen her & not able to minimise the effect returned
turnd to the lady he had preserved at the expense
of all he valued in life & with a countenance
full of horror & despair said to her Madam I have

neither power nor time to utter any thing to prevent

found by those who seeing the destress of the
found by those who seeing the distress of the
distress of the pinnacle afar off were coming
to administer what relief the occasion would
admit.
