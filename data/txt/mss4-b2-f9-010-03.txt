My dear Cousin,
+++ We have all need to witness a taking deeper root in the ground of Divine love, & to have our affections to created objects bounded by it, that so when the storms of adversity assault, our spirits may know a stability & support in the day of trouble, which nothing less can procure for them: that when the world speaks trouble, Christ Jesus may speak peace to our tossed minds. May this continue to be thy anchor & thy refuge, my dear friend! As men & women we are fallible, & diversified in as to tempers, habits & dispositions, so that even the children of the heavenly family may differ in sentiments & opinions about earthly things: but as these cannot live without getting their food in due season, their participation together at the Lords table renews their amity & brotherly kindness, & the love of God melts down the hardness of the natural part, so that in malice they are children, & love as brethren: that is, their falling-out is like that ^of little children, a little pettish, fit & soon over, & their love to one another is like that^ of brethren & sisters of the same family, in which an elder or wiser child may exhort, reprove & even correct a younger, or more giddy one, but still the brotherly-kindness & common good of the family be uppermost, & the bond & cement of the whole.
