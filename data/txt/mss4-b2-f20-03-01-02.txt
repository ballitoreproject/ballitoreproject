From Richard Shackleton to _ _ _

Ballitore 3d of 5th month 1751

Dear--

I received thine from Edinburgh, & am well pleased that time & distance have not obliterated me from thy memory. I can say also that ^on my part^ I have not forgot thee but am desirous for thy welfare in every respect, that as thou growest in years, thou mayst grow in grace, & as thou improvest in human learning thou mayst become an adept in divine. Divinity, dear, is not a trade, but it is a science, & that the most noble of all sciences. It comprehends in it the finest speculations of moral philosophy, & what is more reduces them to practice. Humility, patience, ^charity^ abstinence, & simplicity, & all the virtues are included in it, they are not only understood but exercised here: & by how much actions exceed words, & a possession is beyond a profession, by so much is the religious man more excellent than the scholar. I wish for thee, dear friend, amid thy diligent attention to thy studies that thou mayst at times feel a degree of that power, which will excite in thee a contempt for the knowledge of this world, & a thirst for spiritual knowledge: this as it is given way to, will wean thee gradually from the nature & spirit of the world, in which there is trouble, & draw thee towards Him in whom there is peace. This, dear--, will let thee see how to enjoy & use all things in their [?] seasons & in their places, & will sanctify ^sanctify^ thy natural & acquired accomplishments, & render them beneficial to thyself & others. I hope thou wilt not be offended at my freedom: I have a secret love for thee, & would therefore press it home to thee to reflect on these things. Be not ^one^ of those who can conform [page number 323] (they think it a part of good-breeding) in dress, speech & behaviour to those with whom they converse. Those ^They^ may assume, if they please, the title of gentlemen, but I think they have not a just right to that of christians; for our Great Pattern told his followers that he had chosen them out of the world, & therefore the world hated them: consequently they were of a spirit different from the world. And the Apostle Paul charges the Romans not to be conformed to this world, but to be transformed by the renewings of their minds &c and I am in no doubt but that the disciples of Christ, in their garb, speech & deportment wore the badge of their great Master, some mark which distinguished them from the world. Peter seems to have been known to the damsel by his very aspect to have been with Jesus_ when he denies it another tells him Thy speech berot ^t^ ayeth Thee. So that to conceal his profession of Christ, his last resource was to curse & swear.
Whether much stress may be laid on this particular quotation or not, I am sure the sSpirit of Truth leads & always led into the path of humility & self-abasement, & when this has dominion in the mind, I am sure, there will be visible marks on the body, the gem will shine through the casket.
	Thus far I have wrote ^written^ to thee in love, & in love take leave at present & bid thee heartily Farewell
	[endorsement] Richard Shakleton
