her natal day - the year thou now completes is the
- Never fear I will not divulge
I have just now time to acquaint thee that our
hopes of Pats recovery are beginning to get the better
of our fears - he had a change for the better on third
day since which he continues to mend - he was up in
his chair this day & is not worse for it A few
days I hope will confirm him out of danger if
he should not relapse - I had the pleasure of seeing

I find she meditates a pretty considerable stay in

conveying my letters which may possibly go Portage-free
if not I suppose they will be taxed only as Single
I have not yet met with an opportunity for Cork when
such offers I shall be mindful to send the boxes

to all at home
Thy affectionate
