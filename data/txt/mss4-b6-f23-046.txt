The Sun had sunk with shorten'd ray,
The Moon advanc'd with starry train,
Mild Zephyrs danc'd in sportive play,
And vernal flowers deck'd the plain.
Along the banks of Griese's silver stream
Fidelio meditating rov'd,
[deletion]Philosophy[/deletion]
Philosophy, not Love, his theme,
Love's tender traces from his heart remov'd.
Fidelio, a tender flame
Once did his ardent bosom fire,
Nor mortal eer did purer frame,
Or did sincerity inspire.
But Fate, opposer of human will,
Forbad him fan this pleasing fire,
From hence the Muse his soul shall fill,
Amoret he dares no more admire.
Oft through this deep philosphis shade
The glowing embers faintly gleam,
The Soul, when deep impressions made,
Slowly regains it's wonted frame.
Fidelio, in pensive mood,
The winding margin mov'd along,
Silence ev'n rul'd the bubling flood,
No spray produc'd it's warbling song.
Where hoary Griese, in wonder, stays
His rapid current to behold
Retreat's high Dome
