Dublin 12th of 12th mo 1828
My dear Elizth
Thou wilt be sorry to hear that our poor
little Mgt. is very ill in typhus fever, she
seem'd to recover the measles tolerably well
& I hoped all danger was over, when on 2nd day
last she grew very tired & weary & complain'd
of a headake, I gave her medecine which seem'd
of use however the symtoms encreased & I sent
for Doctor Henry who is attending her & pronounced
the disease typhus fever, alas how uncertain are
our enjoyments I was beginning to indulge myself
with the hope of seeing you all at Christmas &
thought that I might have taken Margt for change
of air after the measles & was & was rejoicing at
the thoughts of [insertion]all the children[/insertion] having got over that treacherous disorder
so well, truly we must always rejoice with trembling
We are quite in uncertainty about the issue at present
& endeavour to hope but fears will arise, the poor child
is very heavily affected & often sighs & seems greatly
oppress'd with illness, her skin very hot & dry
She [unclear]pass[/unclear] a good deal of time in a kind of slumber
give my love to the girls Elia & Selina & let them
know how we are here. I intend writing to D[insertion]e[/insertion]borah
when any alteration takes place ever thy SB
poor Magt got thy two letters which gave her great
pleasure Henry wishes for one directed to himself
he is with Elith at May street which everyone greatly

My dear Elizabeth
I have received thy kind letter, and
should have replied to it ere this, were it not for
the almost intire occupation of my time since
I left Hampstead - It would give me pleasure
to revisit Ballitore, and to become thy guest for
a short time, but I could not at present conveniently
accomplish either. Accept therefore my
grateful acknowledgement of thy kindness, and
believe me with much love thy affectionate
E Gough
My dear love salutes my kind friend Mary Doyle
Remember me kindly to A Wright - tell my
dear H W it would give me much pleasure
to hear from her - This is a very trying time
to poor Sarah, I am come here to spend some hours,
with the hope of relieving her of the fatigue of attending
Margt. I shall be a poor substitute for
for maternal tenderness, but I shall do my best -
H Boardman very poorly at Glendruid - she is much
to be felt for without a fixed home. I ought to
feel for the Rovers.
