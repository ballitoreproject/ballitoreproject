My Dear Friend
I am now sat down to answer in some sort my
my beloved M Shackletons letter that I last received the former
one seems rather too far back to reply to at this period of time
tho I can say in truth I was neither unmindfull of thine or thy
dear sisters or thy worthy fathers but such a creature am I that is had
in your remembrance in this distant land, so unworthy of such a favour
wholly unfit to answer them, tho have often strove to attempt it but one
thing or other seem'd to prevent, & so little time to ourselves in the summor
we were far from any place a letter cou'd be convey'd to Philidelphia or any
other seaport town being in the back parts of america. North carolina where
the weather was so extream hot, that it is scarce possible for aruopian to
have any Idea of it, but was thro the great kindness of him whose tender
care is over all his works favour'd with health save one fit of illness
my dear Companion had for a few days, & after got brave so as to proceed
on the journey our appetites failed us much but as we took to drinking
milk & water it seem'd to supply in a good degree the place of other food
but I thought it admirable how my companion was supported with so little
nourishment but so it is that kind providence fits the back for the burden
I have not been unmindful of thy request concerning that poor youth John
William I requested of John Ridgway to go to George Baker & get him as he
lives by the place where the shipping comes in to search all the log Books
to try if such a name was in & enquire of the captains whether they brought
any Young man that answered thy description & when I came to this [insertion]place [/insertion] to the
Yearly meeting about three weeks ago I got a friend to do in like manner
but no account of such a one as yet there was a young man of our acquaintance
going down to Virgina that I expect will take the necessary
care at them seaports but I think it looks rather doubtful of his coming
to this land, yet I hope no care shall be wanting on my side to have
a look out, his poor mother I sympathize with & shou'd be very glad it
lay in my way to contribute the least relief, for surely her afflication
must be great, tho he is not yet heard of, if he came to this land it is probible

we may meet with him in our passing [insertion]along[/insertion] as we have met with some others
that leave stray'd from the land of their Nativity ~ poor Ally fords sons
I am affraid will not be of much comfort to her one of them is in the hospitable
of Philidephia, out of his reason the other we met with in North
carolina far from friends or any meeting & [insertion]scarce[/insertion] any appearance of a friend
we gave him the best advice we were capable of & which believe he took kind,
this to thy self as there is no use afflicting the afflicted, but poor parents
carefully bring up their children & knows not for what end, but well
it is for those that are mercifully preserved within the sacred enclosure
of truth, I suppose you heard that after we landed in the city we were
engaged on a family visit, & there we staid for the most part for near
six months, sat with near 400 families, there are upwards of 200 families
in another meeting we have not been at yet nor knows not whether ever
we shall find [insertion]it[/insertion] our place or not, it looks as if we ware about to enter on
the same service in this town, in a day or too, where I think there is about
50 families I can say but little about [insertion]my[/insertion] little ability, if I can be preserved
from doing any hurt if I can do no good, it hope to look upon [insertion]it[/insertion] a great favour
thou knows at leest I am but a poor ignorant creature, but if i can be blest
with a greatful heart for the many blessings & priviledges I enjoy that is
my chief desire, we know my dear friend our time here is but short & alltogether
uncertain therfore we ought to be doing whatsoever our hands find
to do & that with all our might in humility & fear, i often think of that
saying of my family being poor in manasseth & I the least in the fathers
house & sometimes I fear whether I am of the family at all, I often compare
myself to this season of the year as I go along, seeing the leaves of all what
a stripping time it is o how naked the trees looks when uncloath'd [insertion]&[/insertion] when
the leaves that was once green & beautiful becomes dri'd up & ready to fall
for want of that sap that kept them beautiful wherewith the [deletion]thy[/deletion] trees were
cover'd, is it not somewhat similar to those that loose the sap there is the tree
but where is the beautiful covering or cloathing, there are many things to
awaken to a sence of my nothingness & unworthiness, & if forsaken of him
in whom dwells all the treasures of wisdom & knowledge, what am I only
[deletion]only[/deletion] like a little striped tree, but this is not the case with thee & thy beloved
sister is not one full of fruit & the other full of blossoms may no wind whatsoever
blast the blossoms till the fruit is [unclear]knit[/unclear] & is what I have much desird for thee,
my belove'd friend that the precious talents may be occupied to the praise of

him who graciously bestowed them I make no doubt but you will think I am
tedious in writing I think it is a month since I began this letter & never cou'd get so
much time as to finish it we no sooner finish'd the family Visit in Baltimore but
we mov'd here & enterd on the same service in this town of Wilmington, where there is
100 & 15 [/unclear] families so you may know how our time is taken up that I can scarce spare
a minute thou mention'd in thine about Wm.. Wearing B Lacky's forster brother he keeps
school in Philidephia a man of good refute he is married to John Haughtons Widdow
he makes her third Husband he looks poorly & often was so last winter.
I hope my beloved girls will not cease writing to me as often as leasure and
opportunity offers I acknowledge myself indebt greatly to thy worthy father,
Brother & sister but thou knows I have got nothing to pay yet if they wou'd be
kind enough to trust me a little more I hope if I am not able to pay in word
I shall not be wanting in desire tell thy dear mother that her Uncle is still
in the land of the living in every sence of the word, tho at times his faculties
much impaird thro infirmities turnd of 92 but still is favour'd with intervals
of a solid remembrance of the living spring & I have no doubt is still mercifully
favour'd to draw water therefrom for his refreshment is it not wonderfull and
withal beautifull to see freshness & greeness at upwards of ninety too years
of age oh the preserving power what language can he breath forth only oh
thou that has been with me all my life long leave one not nor forsake in my
concluding moments & I believe he will not farewell farewell with abundance
of love to you all & every branch of the family & all the friend there Saml. Haughton
& wife. Kilconner Friends but about all [unclear][/unclear] Dear Debby & her Thos.. & my little Namesake
any others in thy freedom in which
my Dear Companion unites and
I remain thy poor sincerly affect.
