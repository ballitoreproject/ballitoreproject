My dear E
the first starch that went cost 5/-,
& what goes now 4..9 - I owe for the castsup
& Lard Catsup 15s/- I forgot how many pounds of lard
there are in the crock & what the crock cost but I can
find it in thy letter, - I am sorely disappointed at
not going to Ballitore & fear I must give it up altogether
for the present. Why did you not tell me that M
Dawson was with HS TF brought me a deal
of news, I write very badly but my hand is cold
I wish to send this by Connor, tell M S I wish
I could go while she is at the post office her
note was very pleasant I got the nice fresh
eggs but you send too many at a time I
am not allow'd eggs yet but I think I will
soon try one of yours, how I wish to go see
you but I am afraid of Magt, taking the
Scarletina I was almost sorry I put off going
at first when I found how long I was kept away.

I have not gone out on foot yet but am much
better than I was but still taking medecine which
I need not do were I with you, we expect to get
Mick Burne here soon by way of a house servant
I will have time enough to train him I suppose
I'm afraid he will make but a bad hand of it
but we want someone who would clean knifes
& forks & shoes & the gig & would also help the girls
we should either do this or get another woman
& then we would be still obliged to have James
coming about the house so we think one person
will do in the shape of Mick see what a
rig ma roll I have given I hope my father
will not ask to see this it is so abominably
written with dear love to your small family including
M S I bid farewell ever thy SB
