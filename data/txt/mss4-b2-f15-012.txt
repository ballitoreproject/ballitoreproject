C Dale 8th month 8th 1791


        Thy affectionate Letter my Dear Friend and Father in the Truth - proved as thine has ever done a strength and encouragement to me - and altho I have little expectation of conveying any thing of like value - I believe it will be acceptable to thee & thine, to hear, that your Friends at the Dale are well - & that some of them continue however feebly to struggle ^to keep^ on the Lords side - these have many seasons of dismay - yet now and then are consoled in the beleife, that tho day and night succeed each other - the Lord keeps covenant with both - & surely it is better to be a Door keeper in his house - than to Dwell in the Tents of Wickedness - the longer I live & the more I see of my own manyfold infirmities - but in this I rejoice an encreasing prospect of the infinite perfections of Him - in whom I desire to have my portion for ever - pray for me my Endeard Friend - that nothing may separate from that Love - wherewith Christ has Loved me, for if I loose this - my all is gone 
It afforded us all much satisfaction to hear of thyself & Valuable Companions getting safely to Ballitore & finding rather an encrease of health - amongst thy near connection - I hope with thee your amiable Richard will outgrow his complaints - & be so preservd as to walk in the footsteps of the flock of Christs Companions - few Parents have more to rejoice in then thy excellent Wife & thyself - or I believe oftener commemorate this [illegible] - blessing of having the Dew of Heaven, added unto the fatness[?] of the Earth, well may the Lord prosper his own precious[?] work in your family - until there is an arrival to that state of perfection unto which we are individually called - for Day unto Day uttereth speech - & night into night sheweth forth knowledge my Beloved Friend R Young & myself reachd home just a week after you left Sunniside, I felt my loss sensibly in being deprivd of an opportunity of thy instructive Company - but as our fellowship consists in being where, & what we ought to be - I am thankful in knowing - best intercourse was not impeded  RY returnd with no prospect of rest she had for many month had a prospect of moving towards Durham, Northumberland and Scotland in the 7th month - she accordingly laid her concern before Friends in the 6th month our Dear S. Appleby also expressing her engagement to accompany her in this prospect - with which Friends united - & they had a Certificate at last month meeting - & set out the 21st of 7th month - my Brother R Reynolds my Husband & myself accompanied them to Leek - when after visiting Friends there - they went towards the General Meeting ^at Ackworth^ & we returnd home sitting a meeting at [illegible] on our way  I find their land is made threefold - by our Dear Friend Elizabeth Juke joining them at York - she is likely to be with them through the Country of Durham - but whether into Scotland or not - seems yet uncertain my RY requested her Dear Love might be conveyd - & wishd me to say a letter from thee directed to George Miller Edinburgh would be truly acceptable - I expect - they may be there in about a month 
Dear Samuel Smith with many other Friends were at Ackworth - & it was a time of favour - the blessing continuing to descend upon that useful institution - John Hipsleys removal there has been very seasonable - & I hope he will have his reward for such an act of obedience - John Townsend, & Richard Baker was also there - they was entering on a visit to the Northern Countys - so that the Lord is yet mindful of his heretage - & his sending forth his servants - to stir up the pure mind - by way of remembrance - as also to invite the scatterd in Israel & dispersed in Judah to return to their Heavenly Shepherd while a day of mercy is continued
I have been with some anxiety expecting a letter from my Dear S Shackleton, but hithertoo have been disappointed if she is now returnd to her Fathers-house - tell her I expect an account of her late Journey - & give my Love most affectionately to her - this likewise attends every branch of thy family 
Any intelligence from [illegible] Mills would be acceptable to me - I have not heard from or Dear E Pim for sometime - please to convey my Love to them & Dear James Abel - James Clibborn & Wife Samuel Elly H 
Our Valued Friend Ann Summerland is much recoverd gets out to meetings - and edifys her Friends there - We have at present a valuable addition to our family in the Company of Richard Dearman & his Wife their own house not being yet ready for them - we feel our minds united to them in best fellowship - & as I believe they have stepd cautiously in coming here - so I hope they will be a strength to the right minded in our poor month meeting  my Dear Sister Sarah has been about 3 weeks with my Sister Fowler[?] during her laying-inn - she is now recoverd has a fine Boy - which is called Thomas - my Sister is expected back this week  our Dear P H Gumey[?] returnd on 7th day - from a Journey to York & Ackworth - Martha Haworth came with her & sat our meetings yesterday she seems finely brings a good account of Martha Routh - & also that Sarah Taylor has been able to ride out in a Chaise Martha returns home in a day or two
