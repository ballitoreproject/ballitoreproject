24 Tuesday - Papa seemed to be greatly
pleased with Dickens and is going
to take me in on Wednesday -
Charlie and Avy came out to dinner.
25 Wednesday - Well I have [underline]seen[/underline]
and heard [underline]Dickens[/underline] - The round room
at the Rotunda at 3 O'clock - It was
well filled - Papa had taken 2 of the
best seats - so we were well off.
Precisely at 3 he appeared - but not
at all the Dickens I had pictured in
my imagination so different that
at first I could not believe it was
he -
August
