May I hope you will write to the Bishop
as soon after receipt of this - as you possibly
can make convenient - as no time is to be lost
My Dear Mrs. Leadbeater /
I received the following Letter this Day in
answer to a Letter of mine soliciting the Cure
of Moate - which I by leave to copy for your inspection -
with reminding you of the friendly promise
[double transcription] you of the frirndly promise
you made me in Ballitore & offering you some
comments which I think you will have the goodness
to suffer to direct you in fulfilling the promise
you so kindly made -
"Sir,
I was favoured with your Letter of
the 30th of December, informing me of your wish
to become Curate of Moate &c I have no engagement
on my hands, & intend to lay before the Bishop
of Meath whatever applications I may receive for
the vacant Cure, within a limited time - not having
the honour of knowing you, I request you will be so
good as to furnish me with an account of such

particulary with suitable references as you may
suppose I would wish to have on this occasion.
At this moment I do not know how to direct
a Letter to the Bishop of Meath
I am Sir, your very obd.
honorble. Svt.
