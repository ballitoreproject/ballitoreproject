Dreams told by Abigail Watson.
1.
Said she thought she was sitting at a gate(where she often sat)
& while there saw a great army coming towards her, & thought
she heard a voice telling her she must be a Trumpeter to them, but
she said she would not, for it was not at all fit for a Woman to
be employed in any such business, & that she would not: but
still was told she must; till she thought they came up just where
she was, & that they were a most beautiful sight, keeping their
proper ranks, & a row of Trumpeters in the front, surrounding melodiously,
& that presently she was up among them marching
along, & sounding a Trumpet likewise, in order to conquer the opposite
army, which seemed ready to engage them.
2d
That she with several other young people set out on some journey
together, & that after a while by degrees they all left her to go alone
& as she was going many stones [deletion][/deletion] seemed to be flying about
her, in danger of hurting her much, so after a while that she
saw a mountain which seemed to be as fire, & from it [unclear][/unclear]
many balls of fire, all about, as if they would kill her; so that she
was forced to go on her knees a good way to escape them, & even that
would not do, till she was bowed almost with her head to the
ground: & after much difficulty got so far as that the mountain
disappeared, & she got to a house, where she waited long at the
door, & at last got in.
