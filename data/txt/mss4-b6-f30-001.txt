Doctor Mackenna offers his respects to
Miss Shackleton,. returns her his most
sincere thanks for her friendly introduction
of him to Mr. Burke.
When Mr. Shackleton was in town Dr
McK designed to entreat him to be the
bearer of the acknowledgements he so
much owed & so earnestly desired to offer,
but Mr. S.'s occupations in town & sudden
departure prevented him not only that
favor, but another of which he was not a
little ambitious, to sollicit more than one
interview & some small share in the
acquaintance of a gentleman, whose literary
reputation & amiable character render that

honor enviable to every person in whose eyes
those qualities are respectable, but to Doctor
McKenna there was an additional motive
the near relation to Miss Shackleton, to
whom he is so much obliged, & whose elegant
talents & cultivated mind he so much admires.
Nor is it simply his obligation that
Miss Shackleton shd by the most elegant
introductory card he has ever seen open a path
to the acquaintance of the first man of the
age we live in. - Dr McK is in no small degree
flattered that a Lady whose delicacy he
will not wound by saying what she
merits, shd. recollect him; it is no way pleasant
that one who is very much attached to Ireland
should feel superior duties & considerations
fix him to a foreign country; but it is
a consolation far from inconsiderable

could he have the happiness to number
amongst his friends one of the most respectable
families in the country he has left and
almost the only Lady he ever knew in that
country, whose taste & talents are alike
accomplished.
Indeed Miss Shackleton you must
allow that there is somewhat of a [unclear]Bathan[/unclear]
fog in the air of Ireland fatal or at least
noxious to accuracy & elegance in judging &
composing; I corrected myself when I was about to
say fatal for I have before me an instance
of the reverse which I shall not quote to you.
[unclear]Dear[/unclear] When shall we expect that those
happy productions which delight private
circles will come to rescue our country
from its opprobrium. - it is not fair that
the great character of the age we live in shd
have as yet no poetic incense. [unclear][/unclear] brother
J Addison & every other name of which at
best it wd take a dozen to make one Burke
are classic names - indeed so is Burke, but the
Muses will do themselves injustice if his

You have heard of Mr Sheridan's eulogium on
Mr. Burke, & what must please you not a
little public justice will have its due on
Mr Hastings -
niche in the temple gets no aid from their
hands - if Suada & the Graces are the
only artificers employed in erecting it.
