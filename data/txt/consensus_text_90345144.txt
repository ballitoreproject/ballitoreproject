22nd - We went out to buy
some things early this morning
and on our return to our great
surprise found Ellen who had
not long come up from Ballitore.
It was very pleasant to see her
again; she came out with us
afterwards, and after we parted
Polly and I went to pay a long
owed visit to the Thifts, who however
were as the man told us just going
out, so we did not go in. They
overtook us driving in a carriage
on our way from that. Polly &
I then paid a visit to the Exhibition
where we spent the rest of the morning.
reading and working &c &c -
23rd. Went to meeting after which
having called for Ellen we
went again to the Exhibition
as we had appointed to meet
The evening we passed
