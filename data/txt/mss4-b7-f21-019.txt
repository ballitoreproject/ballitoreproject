Your letter, my kind Friend, seconded the reproaching
[unclear][/unclear] my own Conscience, which accused me of leaving your favor
[unclear][/unclear] I believe written some line in [unclear]Rugt[/unclear].) / too long unanswer'd. —
The fact is, that having nothing material to communicate, I felt
an unwillingness to write, what could not be worth reading, how[unclear]ever[/unclear],
as you express a desire of hearing from me, you will be satisfied
with my wish of pleasing you, read till you are weary, & then
[underline][unclear]a[/unclear]ccording to promise[/underline] put my letter into the fire. I will begin
as a Woman of business ought, by methodically answering all
your queries — "The chilling hand of Time" has had its full effects on
[unclear]b[/unclear]oth the Captain & myself, our hoary heads almost vie with our
surrounding Mountains in whiteness- with this mortifying difference
[unclear]t[/unclear]hat the Summer rays do not restore [deletion]their[/deletion] [insertion]our[/insertion] native hues. The damp[unclear]n[/unclear]ess
of my Cottage, aided by that same [underline]Time[/underline], has introduced to me
Companion who seems resolved not to leave me, Rheumatism
[unclear]em[/unclear]braces me so strongly, that I suffer almost as much, as if I
had received the French [underline]Fraternal embrace[/underline] — which commences in
Falsehood, & ends in Ruin! I think of using Medea's Shuttle, &
trying

to scald my Enemy to death, for I mean to visit Bath this Spring
sho'[unclear]ld[/unclear] own the truth, I expect more benefit from the Society of a few
tho' to own the truth, I expect more benefit from the Society of a few
chosen Friends there, than from all the hot water I can swallow, or
bathe in. [unclear]Thifty[/unclear] has pass'd the Winter with Mrs. Quin, & I expect will
return with me; but Betsy is to accompany me, & be left behind.
return with me; but Bessy is to accompany me, & be left behind.
Turpin still continues my Servant, she has now a Month's leave
of absence & is at Newcastle visiting her Relations; who, I believe, are
very anxious of getting her settled amongst them, particularly a
Sister who keeps a little Shop, to whom Turpin's money would be
very acceptable — I think they make her rather dissatisfied, & I sha[unclear]ll[/unclear]
be more grieved, than surprised - to find she gives up her place.
Louis' health continues but indifferent, which occasions his being
frequently at home, & prevents his being a [underline]great Scholar[/underline].
Miss Hamilton is at present in Scotland, but I expect will return
next Month, & pass the Summer in this neighborhood. I am delighted
with her Modern Philosophers, which I think the very best Novel I ever
read. To be sure, Bridgetina is an [underline]Energetic Miss[/underline], but she is throughout
consistent to her Principles; & where the human mind can be
work'd upon by such false, & absurd notions as Godwin's Volumes contain,
[underline]there[/underline] we may also expect to find the practical application of them,- -
& what an application, in the forlorn, abandon'd, & dying Julia! surely
such a picture of fallen & degraded Innocence, must produce some
effect on the Vallaton's of the day; The work has great merit in a literary


judgement; I think she is not at all likely to prove the truth, or [unclear]fallacy[/unclear]
of her System, in a Child of her own; - She has extreme ill health, & I
should suppose would be wise enough to keep herself a spinster.
Certainly she first drew her breath in Ireland, - but that was all, for
she was removed almost immediately into Scotland & educated by an
Uncle & Aunt, there, So I believe You, & the Scotch, must dispute you[unclear]r[/unclear]
right in [underline]her[/underline], as ye do in Fiuhn Mac Comhal - I read part of one
Vol. of H.M. William's Switzerland, but it was too flowery & too [underline]studied,[/underline]
me, you see I want taste, but I do not want affection for my Frien[unclear]d[/unclear]
so we will talk of Ballitore — I rejoice to hear of the [underline]joint School[/underline], &
hope it will be highly beneficial, — but let me [underline]whisper[/underline] in your ear
my Good Mary! [underline]keep Abraham out of it[/underline] — or "the Phonix" will no[unclear]t[/unclear]
rise with its original beauty — Richard, with such an Assistant a[unclear]s[/unclear]
you describe will go on well, but what can they do without the Ho[unclear][/unclear]
I am glad to hear poor Susan has met with a Friend to reconcile [unclear][/unclear]
to the living a little longer without dear Mary. Remember me very
kindly to all those you know I Love, & pray tell J. Bewley we shod. be
obliged to him when he writes to Dublin, to enquire how our business
stands with the Swindler — tho' I suspect it requires no Spirit of
Prophecy to [underline]foretell[/underline]. If Fanny attempts to make a Modern Philosopher
of her little Beauty, threaten her with my [underline]heavy displeasure[/underline],
but I do not at all expect that she will incur it. I shall write to T.
Wilkinson in a few days, & will send your message; such confidence
is placed in his judgement & integrity, that he is overwhelm'd with o[unclear][/unclear]
