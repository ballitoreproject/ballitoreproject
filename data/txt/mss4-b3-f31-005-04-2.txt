My dear friend

+++ I understand that Elizabeth Tuke has joined Rebecca Young & Susanna Appleby in a religious visit to some parts of the North of England. Thus the young people, in the active part of life are willing to endeavour to earn a bit of honest bread  Mayest thou be strengthened every way, my dear child, to put in thy sickle into the field of gospel-labour, & reap the blessed fruits of present & future peace!
