Thou asks me whether it is true that we have
no singing birds in America? There is certainly a
very great paucity of them, nor can I say that I
ever heard one in the fields, altho' we lived, one year
in the Country. - What they call Thrushes - are not gifted
with song. neither are the Blackbirds- Their Robins
are as large as Thrushes and have no red breasts. In
winter we never see a small bird of any kind.
The most interesting little creature here is the Humming
Bird, which is of beautiful plumage & delicate shape -
the humming noise which it makes is agreeable.
To supply the want of [underline]singing[/underline] Birds, the insects & other
ground animals are highly gifted with vocal powers
In summer of a fine evening, our ears are stunned
with the confused noise, arising from myriads of
Frogs, Toads, Grasshoppers, &c &c, & we are glad to
get rid of this Concert, by retreating into the house.
What a peculiar blessing St Patrick conferred on
our "Emerald Isle" when he banished from it, Snakes
toads, and all other venomous animals!
I have spoken to William Grattan respecting
the system of Book Keeping published by Wm Rayner
but he seems to think that nothing of the kind would
succeed here, - they have so many already, in practice. -
a person named Bennett has realized a good deal
of money by giving lectures on this science & his
plan is so very simple, it meets with general approbation. -
Tell Betsy Shackleton, I by no
means attribute her silence to forgetfulness. - I know

her time was pretty much taken up - I am glad she
was pleased with Munster notwithstanding the inhabitants
in that province, are sometimes fond of commotion.
Joseph Lancaster has lately visited Washington
where he received many marks of respect from our
Republican great men, - among others, he was allowed
a seat among the Members of the House of
Representatives. - I must tell thee a good [underline]Pun[/underline]
[insertion]wch.[/insertion] he made, altho' I have already written it in another
letter thro' which perhaps it may have reached
thee.
He delivered a lecture to the members
of Congress, from the Speaker's chair or pulpit. -
After he had finished, Henry Clay (the Speaker) complimented
him very highly & concluded by saying
that the Chair had never been so well filled before
Joseph immediately replied that he disclaimed the
possession of any merit, which could call forth such
a high compliment - that he thought Man at best
was but an imperfect image of the Deity & for
his part he considered that this Chair, exalted as
it was, had never been filled with anything better
than Clay!
He has settled in Philadelphia
where he superintends one or two Schools on his
own plan. I think his visit to America will be
of much service. - I met him several times during
his stay in this City. - He dresses as plain
as ever, & attends meetings [underline]constantly[/underline]. -

Thy defence of [underline]Tommy[/underline] Fisher comes very apropos, to
support his credit as a correspondent - for thou must
know that I have not heard from him in several
months, - not even in reply to the letter in which I
sent thee a message relative to the Walpole family -
& a few days ago, I again wrote him a long Epistle
Now I do not wish to accuse him wrongfully &
therefore conclude [insertion] that [/insertion] a letter from him which I ought
to have received, has miscarried. - Tell him this,
in order that if he has [underline]not[/underline] written his conscience
may accuse him of some neglect. -
Thy verses on the "Quaternion", are very appropriate
& must have proved highly flattering to them.
I have often wished to establish a similar little
society among my youthful acquaintances here
but I have never succeeded in it. I have not
so much time as I could desire to devote to reading
and therefore a Catalogue of the books which I peruse
would be a very short one. - I endeavour to keep
up with the Endinburg Review, as the numbers come
out, & find a good deal of useful information
condensed in them. - I sometimes read the Quarterly
but not regularly, as I do not admire the[deletion]ir[/deletion] politics
of the writers in it. - It was a great privation
to me, during a considerable part of my late
confinement, not to be permitted to read much.
I am anxious to see Madam de Stael's late work
and also "Raffles tour on the Continent" which are
very highly spoken of & I intend devoting the first

leisure hours I can command, to their perusal.
I seldom read Novels, except such ones as "Tales
of my Landlord". in which scraps of interesting
History are blended with well drawn characters,
and all written in a bold, original style. - I perceive
our Countrywoman Lady Morgan, has published another
"National Tale", and there is such magic in this title
as to make me [deletion]to[/deletion] anticipate the possession of the book
What is Maria Edgeworth about? I hope she has
not yet thrown her useful, fascinating pen aside
Dost thou yet correspond with her? Hast thou
ever read Lady Morgan's "ODonnell". It contains
the best drawn character of a genuine, unsophisticated
Irishman (McRory) that I ever met with.
Walter Scott seems to have hung up his Harp
in good earnest. Common report gives him the
credit of having written "Tales of my Landlord".
What a pity it is that Campbell has given
us reason to suppose [deletion]that[/deletion] he and the Muses have disagreed -
His "Pleasures of Hope", is enough to stamp
him as a first rate Poet.
I am afraid I cannot obtain
the minute information thou requests, about the Walpole
family- - but when opportunity presents, I shall
make the attempt. I enquired about C. Finn &
his wife, & am sorry to inform thee that the [unclear]former[/unclear]
died about two months ago. - His widow must
remain here until she winds up his affairs - I
forwarded a letter from her a few days ago per Britannia
to Dublin -
