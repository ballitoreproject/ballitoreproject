August 1857
Vol VII
British Assoceation.
26 Wednesday - Liddy and I went
to town with Papa and Ned, and very soon
after our arrival , Polly and Thomas drove
up - it was [underline]so[/underline] pleasant to see them again,
After lunch we three girls escorted by
Charlie went off to shop , most profitable
employment !!! Aby Shackleton called
for a short time and joined us at lunch.
After tea we all went to the Rotunda
to hear the President of the British Association
read his opening address
The large round room was already
nearly full and with difficulty we
procured good seats. Charlie, Lid,
and I were some way separated from
the rest and [deletion]therefore[/deletion] were the most
fortunate as our seats were nearest
the platform . Papa and Polly were behind
us . Whilst waiting for the hour
8 1/2 to arrive we employed and amused
ourselves looking [underline]at[/underline] and making our
observations upon the various [unclear]sewans[/unclear]
who gradually assembled on the platform
