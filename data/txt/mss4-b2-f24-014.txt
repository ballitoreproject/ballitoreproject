Clonmel 12 of 4th month 1781

My dear Father,

	By our dear friend Nancy Stephens I am desirous to send thee a few lines & she is desirous to bear them to thee, & yet I am badly furnished just at this juncture with time or materials for writing, I wrote thee last week & have still thro favour to continue the information of our welfare, the Children are bravely, & Richard stout & pleasant, how shall I tear him from my Breast & bid adieu to all those endearing tricks & engaging looks he bestows on me when extracting this nourishment? I find it pinch me in idea, & yet if I go to Dublin it seems full time to begin this mortification, if I thought it would further my progress in Grace, & in the saving knowledge thereof, I should be more willing to leave all, but I am so blind & ignorant that I know not what is best for me: may he that opened the eyes of the blind formerly give me also spiritual discerning is the desire of my Heart at this time!
	I say our dear friend Nancy, because I have felt an un^u^sual attachment to her for so short an acquaintance, I believe she is one of the right stamp, & may she grow from stature to stature in stability & rectitude is what I sincerely wish for her, because surely the Lord hath need of such, & designs to honour those who honour him. I thought meeting with her did me good (if I am susceptible of any real good.)
	I suppose this meets thee in better company, therefore shall not take up much of thy time, but requesting my dear love to our beloved Mountmelick friends, Cousin Joseph & Elizabeth Pike, & Joseph Inman & Spouse, also my duty to my Mother, is all which my Husband joins, conclude thy		dutiful & affectionate
	Margaret Grubb

Our dear love to Brothers & sisters as if named.
