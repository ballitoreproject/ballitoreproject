When Virtue thro' the human face
Beams forth with sweet, attractive grace
How blest our feelings while we spy
Benevolence illume the eye
Candour the open brow bespeak
and modest Merit tinge the cheek
While on that lip devoid of guile 
Love sits & forms the endearg smile
But should the pure celestial ray
of heavenly virtue pass away
If scowling brow the eyes untrue
The lip of scorn the pallid hue
Speak desolation & no [deletion]works[/deletion] sport of art
can with such sense of ruin chill the heart.

How altered this once pleasant spot
Since Margaret graced the rural cot
No more the fragrant woodbine here
Decks the white wall & window clear
No more does Pyracanthus spread
Her glistening leaves & berries red
The garden, once the [deletion]Village[/deletion] [insertion]hamlets[/insertion] pride,
gay blowing by the river side,
Gone are its charms gone every flower
and gone the loved umbrageous bower
Beauteous the bower but still more fair
When gentle graceful June was there
Neatness & order now no more
Preside within the Cottage door
[unclear][/unclear] is there, the passer by
Glances [insertion][/insertion] from thence the [insertion]mournful[/insertion] averted eye
Thinks of the [unclear][/unclear] & heaves a sigh
Perhaps a moral to the mind
might through this scene admittance fined
