My dear Friend
Thy letter which I received
two months ago, should
have had an earlier reply, if
during the last few weeks my
time & attention had not been so
much occupied with William
that writing even a few lines
seemed a great exertion. He is
now considerable better, & we
hope with care, & kitchen medicine
plentifully administered, that
he will soon be restored to his
usual strength. He has [deletion][/deletion]
indeed suffered much, & I hope
his present illness may be useful
to him in future life, in preventing
him from being so careless
of his health. His illness was

entirely occasioned by walking
very quickly to Belfast, & during
the course of the evening being
suddenly chilled by sitting in a
room in which the historic society,
of which he is a member meet.
I have not heard of Anne
Grant lately, except that she
was publishing a poem entitled
1813. I had not heard of the
report respecting her daughter
until I received thy letter.
G. Balfour has published her
[deletion]the[/deletion] melo-drama, Kathleen O'Neill.
I had intended sending a copy by
S Barcroft to Ballitore, but I was
disappointed in not getting it
yesterday; but I intend sending
it the first opportunity -
I enclose thee a MS which [unclear][/unclear]
is O'Hallaron's history of Ireland
as I know the writing to be thine
I thank thee for wishing to see us
in Ballitore this summer, but we
have no intention of leaving home.
We have got a habit of not leaving
home unless the whole family
are of the party - This habit
altho' very pleasant to us is rather
inconvenient, as we make
instead of a visit to our friends
a visitation -
I have not seen the Tour of Dr
Syntax, but I have seen some
extracts from it which make
me wish to see the entire poem.
Time will only permit me
to add that I am very [unclear][/unclear]
& sincerely [unclear]thine[/unclear]
S Hancock
