Devizes 20th Feby 1791.
My Dear Sir,
Your favor of the 12th Inst is now before me; I am
still sensible & hope I ever shall be of the care and attention
I reced from you and yours at a time I needed it most; it is
very flattering to me to find that you think I have not abus'd
those early marks of your care & friendship, and that I have
done all in my power to shew a grateful sense of the same
by a discharge of my pecuniary obligations, and at all times
a ready acknowledgement of past favors - I have had no
occasion since my last letter to alter my opinion of Mr. R:E.
on the contrary I have had cause to add [underline]ten fold[/underline]: I know nothing
whatever of his plans; and least you shoud suppose that I have
any hand [underline]whatever[/underline] in [unclear]Rentons[/unclear] proposals, I think it necessary
to declare to you [underline]upon my honor I have not[/underline]: [underline]had not[/underline], nor will
I ever be concernd in a business [underline]so shabby[/underline]. if I can serve you
I will most gladly. and if I take any step in this business it will
be to do you justice, and my actions (as the ever have been thank
God) shall be done in the open day light: I'm no friend to
darkness - my regt. goes into Ireland in about three weeks
I shall be there very shortly after them, and on my arrival you
may expect to hear from me - with my affectionate respects
to your family at large - I remain Dr. Sir
sincerely yrs. Thos. Eyre
PS:
[unclear]Let[/unclear] me know [underline]by return[/underline] [underline]of post[/underline], if you
[unclear]are[/unclear] this side the water this spring
