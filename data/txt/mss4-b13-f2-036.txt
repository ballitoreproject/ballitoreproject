11th.. To meeting in Kelso with the few members belonging to it: &
after dining with Margt.. Anderson, who came with us, behind
John Sutton, a young man who has come with us from Carlisle,
we came to Lauder, 16 miles, where David Priestman had got
long before us, & prepared a place for a meeting with the inhabitants,
to which we went a little after 6, & in which the
Sarahs, M:Anderson, & D:Priestman spoke:- they people behaved
with rather more decentcy than in some of the others. - I was
not sorry when it broke up, having stood all the time, & been
a good deal press'd. 12th.. Travel'd, 24 miles, to Edenburgh, a great
grand looking City, were kindly received by George Miller's wife, her

Upon my arrival I was treated with letters from home.
