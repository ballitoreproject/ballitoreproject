My dear Eliza
I do not like to let the opportunity
of Fred= going to town pass
without a line to say that we are
all well. I have no news to tell
thee Frederic came home last night
he seems to have enjoyed himself
& I think looks better than he did
we left Sally B at Ann Allens
last she has been with us this
week back & is now gone to
stay a few days with him
she talks of going to Ballitore
to stay with Elizth [deletion] while
Cos Betsy is in the north. Fred=
told thee I suppose of the day we
spent at Bray head, it was very
pleasant & we all enjoyed ourselves
the view from it is as handsome
 as ever & the heath & furze beautifully
in blow. we brought

Sally Savage sr with us (stopped
at their cottage to tea where we
met the parade people, Marmion
was not there so we had not the
pleasure of seeing him. on seventh
day my mother went to town &
as it often happens visitors came
Hannah Perry & Eliza Sharpley they
staid a good while, just as they
were gone & that we were thinking
of going to dinner Captain Gaston
& Olivia walked in, they are
going to Cork in a week &
came over to see my Mother
before she goes the rest of the
family are pretty well her
mother they want to get to Ballitore
but are afraid she will
not consent to it. Olivia looks
very well as fat & comfortable
as ever. the Doctor is not quite
stout. my Mother & Edward
came out to tea he slept at Richards.
and went into town to dinner
Saml & Emma took a drive
out to see us on first day the
latter seems finely we had no
visitor else. R & E dined with
us as they were also solus. I
am glad to hear you are all
so well. I hope [underline]thou[/underline] wilt
continue so, and that wilt
not be the worse of all
thy exertions. give my dear love
to Frank & Lucy. I wish we could peep
in at you. with dear love to thy
self I am thy affectionate Sister
Selina

kept waiting. Emmy is very
well. Richard & Arthur are very
busy cutting down trees in the
Glen.
