We had quite a family gathering.

[underline]Uncle Richard[/underline], [underline]Aunt Elizabeth[/underline], [underline]Florence[/underline],
[underline]Uncle Francis[/underline], [underline]Aunt Martha[/underline], [underline]Uncle Manliffe[/underline]
[underline]Uncle Frederick[/underline], and [underline]Uncle Arthur[/underline].
besides ourselves - who were all present.

charades, but they were a failure.
not passing off with eclat,
Uncle Francis staid the night.
2nd.. Sat
