From the same to the same

Dear Cousin,
	+++ Thy last conveyed an account of several agreeable particulars to me. I am pleased to hear their intentions of building a meeting house at Kilconner are growing mature. The iron was hot, malleable & pliable after a good meeting there. They were ready to say, with Nehemiah, come, let us build. I wish the cold winds ^winter^ coming on may not chill the warmth of their resolutions. The Lord is good in sending his Ministers amongst us, & making them as a flame of fire to assist in kindling a sacrifice among the people, & such temporary aids may be ^are^ very useful; but unless we become so instructed as to wait for fire to come down from heaven to kindle a sacrifice in each of us individually, from one time to another, we shall make little progress in our own individual growth. ++++
	Thine affectionately
		Richard Shackleton
