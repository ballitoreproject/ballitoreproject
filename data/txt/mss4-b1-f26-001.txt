John Thorp's dream
I thought I was intently engaged with some others, in some
outward business, when all on a sudden a message was communicated
by divine authority, but I knew not well from
whence the voice proceeded, however, the words I heard
distinctly to this purpose, "cease, or thou must cease, from
the business thou art now engaged in, there is another
work for thee to do, for the Lord is about to work a [unclear][/unclear]
thorough reformation in the earth than any which hath
hitherto taken place"; to which I thought I answered,
"alas! how is it possible, that I can be of any service in
contribute to this work, being so exceeding poor & destitute
of every degree of strength & ability to do it, & indeed
I thought I felt myself so when I spoke it, as much
as ever in my life: -- unto which I thought the voice
replied -- "thy strength & ability will not be required, the
work can only be effected by the strength & power of God
