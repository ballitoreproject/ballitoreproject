My dear James 
It is 54 years this day since I came into this vale of tears, and such it has indeed been to me. This morning bef thy letter was brought to me, giving the account of the decease of our dear friend James Gough +++ If any memorable circumstances or expressions attended the latter end of this good man, impart them.  A pre-sentiment of the approach of death may be given to religious persons a considerable time before their departure, in order to invite them to a preparation for it, and to quicken their diligence in the discharge of duty, & yet this sense not be so predominant in their minds just at the final close. Divine Goodness seeing meet to strip that king of his terrors, and to occupy the prepared spirit of his faithful, diligent servant with lively hopes and comfortable sensations at the last. And this may probably have been the case of our dear friend deceased. I remember an opportunity at which I was with him, at the late Samuel Woodcock's last spring - He appeared in supplication in a very baptizing manner - the exit out of this world was the burden of the petition - I was exceedingly affected - Samuel died soon after - he is now translated himself. What will become of me I know, ^not^, further than that I must follow.
