I am always pleased to hear of that old disciple James Moreton - whether I shall ever have the satisfaction of seeing him again in this life is uncertain, though I do not altogether despair of it - but I have no doubt but that having passed through many tribulations & exercises of various kinds, his end will be peace. And till that end arrives I wish his mind so stayed, composed & centered in & by divine favour that his last days may be the most happy, pleasant, & comfortable of his life.
