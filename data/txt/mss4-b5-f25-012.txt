Dear Cousn.
Mary Leadbetter
I have been frequently in
Dublin since I had the pleasure of seeing
thee, different causes has prevented me
from getting to Ballitore, altho I felt
interested for those of my acquaintanse
resident there. I may inform thee
I am pretty comfortable in regard
to the prospect I have with my Children
save in one instance, respecting my Daughter
Hanh. who I fear will perservere
in continuing a connection, which I
do not approve of - my Eldest Daughter
is Married into an agreeable Family
at Sheffield. say to Josiah Fairbank son
of the late Wm Fairbank. & who succeeds his
Father as a Land surveyor in Partnership
with his Brother. They have two
fine Boys, & seems comfortably[underline]fixed[/underline]

my younger Daughter, went to London
with me to the yearly meetg but I have
left her on a Visit with an intimate
Frd who has three Daughters in Lincolnshire
& who are interested for her
welfare & who wd gladly I doubt not
persuade her to drop the connection
& acquaintance she has made - My
second Son John, is in a Warehouse
at Manchester & has a Prospect of
doing well, his Health is not very good
he having grown tall & not very stout
my two Boys; Children by my present
Wife, are both likely to do well & with
whom their Mother & I are very happy
together, ye younger [insertion](Thos) [/insertion]is boarded at
a Frds School in Leeds, but we frequently
see him, he is near thirteen
years of Age - His Bror (Fras), now
turnd 15 years, is now abt going an
Apprentice to a Cloth Mercht. who trad
principally to Germany, Russia & Portugal
P.S. Pheobe Blake is Living - Benj North has long been
confind to his Room - [unclear]Resn[/unclear] Nevin's family is well

he was near four years absent from
us, having gone during ye interval of
Pease with Franse to Rouen, in order
to learn the French Language, & it was
some trouble to us to get him home
again, he has been [unclear][/unclear] abt 9 mos,
during wch time he has been studying
ye German Language. his disposition
is good & I hope we shall be happy wth
him - In regard to ye proposals recd
respecting the Poems, I could do with
Ten or a Dozn, or perhaps more, but
as few here, have an Idea of their
merits, not many subscriptions wd
be got, particularly as it is out of my
way making it known I see fresh proposals
wch Darton & Harvey had got; &
perhaps it wd be as easy for me to
get em from there, as it is uncertain
when I may get to Dublin, however
I shall not fix till I hear again from
thee & prior to ye publication, wd have thee
write me, for my government, as may have
obtaind more subscribers some distant
Period may produce the Pleasure of a Meeting
or seeing each other again, my Son
is still in Dublin & I wish him to continue
there for a while - give my
Love to thy Brother & Sister whom
I have seen & believe me to be
thy Affectionate Kinsman

my Lodgers & are return to
Dublin in a few days.
