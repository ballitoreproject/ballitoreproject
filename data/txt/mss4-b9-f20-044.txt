My dear Elizth
Eben leaves us tomorrow & as usual
I have put off to the last to write to thee
& have thereby forgotten much that I wish'd
to say, many thanks for Willy's stockings
poor little fellow has got a severe cold from
the harsh winds lately blowing indeed all
the children even stout Johnny has suffer'd
by them - Would thou [insertion]like to[/insertion] take the charge
of the houses at the Inn & collect the rents
weekly for a per centage which we will settle
when we know whether thou wd be satisfied
to take the trouble on thee, Pat Mowlan is
to pay 2s/- per week if he stay then he
owes some rent I fancy I do not know
at all how affairs stand but wd be glad
thou wd do what thou thought best with
the ten[deletion]n[/deletion]ants surely thou might as well
have a few pounds as another & I dont

think
any one there would [deletion]do it[/deletion] [insertion]manage[/insertion] as well [insertion]as thou wd[/insertion] I would
be glad thou would settle as thou thinks proper
with Jem Murphy, I have spoken to several
about thy lodgings H Lefanu is still in the country
but D wrote to Fanny & has not got an
answer since, we expect a call from her
soon, Poor Deb was not as well as I expected
to see her but I hope the means she is using will
will have [deletion]th[/deletion] a good effect a[deletion]t[/deletion]nd we know that
Doctor Hewey was of great use to her when
she consulted him first she does not seem
worse for her visit to Dublin so far & this
is as much as we could expect this unfavorable
weather, cold & damp, Margt has [unclear]recover'd[/unclear]
her cough greatly & dear E I did not say any
thing to Edw about sending her down at present
she is still so delicate that I know there
would be no use in proposing it I wd be
only told that I wish'd to get rid of the
trouble of her - she is as sharp as a razor
in a manner. I wont go so [unclear]fathomable[/unclear]
& gather all the rent thou is for thy SB
