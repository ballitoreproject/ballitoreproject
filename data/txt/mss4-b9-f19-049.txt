My dear Elizth
I recd thy letter & am much obliged for thy kind
offer of making the sheets, I intended the 24 yards for
2 pair of sheets & the 36 yds for 3 pair the Large ones
should not be shorter than 3 yds whatever the others
might be perhaps I might get 2 bolster cases off the
narrow bre[insertion]a[/insertion]dth but I would not like to make them
much shorter than 3 yds, now I think if thou
made half the number it would be quite enough
for thee & send me the other half unmade
thou wilt want to be in the garden, & if
[unclear][/unclear] acts in to a job of work thou w[unclear][/unclear]
[unclear][/unclear] to leave it till finish'd & I kn[unclear]ow[/unclear]
[unclear]trust[/unclear] the more the last sewing [unclear][/unclear]
thou had for me -
I am glad the Lisburn folk are so well
M Bonham & A Jones surprized us yesterday
they were as usual in a great hurry only
just arrived & would not sit down, We are
all very well here but will feel very lonely when
E & D leave us, Ah those weary ungrateful

Bees, to sting my mother, C Bentham sent forks
here to go to Ballitore, Would not the Cottage
Biography sell just now in England, While
there is such an interest excited there for Poor
Ireland, I find Kathy very agreeable & can
hardly suppose she would do so naughty a
thing to MD, however I am more on my guard
in Consequence of thy notice
ever thine S Barrington
ELeadbeater
Ballitore
Thou heard no doubt of Jane Stephen's death
about 2 weeks ago.
