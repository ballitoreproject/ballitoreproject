Epigram on a Speech lately deliver'd in Ireland —
A Man who play'd a cruel part,
Dared boast he [underline]had an Irish heart[/underline];
" 'Tis false cried Pat, "for on my life
"This Boaster wrong'd a guiltless Wife;
"Who when her spirit fled from Earth,
"Deem'd it his [underline]happiest hour since birth.[/underline]
"Now I, with all my Wit & folly,
"In such a case, could not be jolly,
"Conscience would stare me in the face!
"Not all the pomp of potent Power,
"Nor [underline]Whisky punch[/underline] in such an hour
"Could save Pat's feeling dire disgraced"
