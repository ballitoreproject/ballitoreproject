My dear Cousin Debby,

	++++ I am glad my dear, old friend, thy father went to the Yearly meeting, & I am glad he is returned in safety -- his defect in hearing (doubtless) precluded several advantages, which would otherwise have been derived to him & from him, in the course of the solemnity -- but his feeling I trust is good -- & he heard & felt as much as would let him into the general state of the society -- of the declining declension of which from primitive zeal & simplicity he would observe many sorrowful instances, as also of the weakness in ^the^ support of discipline which is lamentably evident in divers places -- yet I hope his honest heart would be comforted under a sense that the Lord Almighty was graciously pleased still to own us for his people, baptizing prepared spirits by his immediate power, & furnishing his ministers & the elders in his house with wisdom & authority to officiate acceptably before him ++++
	I am, my dear Cousin,
		very affectionately thine
			Richard Shackleton
