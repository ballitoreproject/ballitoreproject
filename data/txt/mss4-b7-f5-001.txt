London of 5th month 1822
ML?
My dear Friend,
I am about to avail myself of a conveyance by
some one of my kind Country-folk to acknowledge thy
kind attention in ordering me [insertion]a[/insertion] copy of your family memoirs
neatly bound I hope that in its present state it will be acceptable
to all its readers — indeed, to myself & my dear
Brother, it is [underline]highly interesting[/underline] - & believing that it will be
so to my Brothers Thomas & William I have sent each
of them a copy —
Robt. Foster told me of having seen thee & thy Sister
Sarah in Dublin —
Though the state of my head is still very trying to myself -
by keeping very quiet - & the kind & affectionate atten-
of my dear Cousin Hannah - I have hitherto attended all the
sittings of the Y. M — and never more to my satisfaction respecting
the Conduct of the Meetings — so that, however some of us
may, from want of continued watchfulness, not have gone on

to that state of usefulness - which might have been better
for us, as individuals, yet, I am thankful to believe, that
the Glory is [underline]not[/underline] departed from our [underline]Israel[/underline] - and that, though
one dies a natural death, & another aparently a spiritual
death - there are still some amongst [insertion]us[/insertion] who continue faithful
Hannah was pleased with thy mention of her Parent, &
desires to be affectionately remembered to thee — Give my dear
love to [underline]all[/underline] thy Sisters — I hope thou hast received a Parcel
of my Aunt Pike's letters - which I sent by Joseph Strongman
I remain, thy truly affte Friend —
Hannah Pim
