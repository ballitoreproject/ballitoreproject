Orphan-House
Aust 12th 1818
Dear Madam
I have to apologize for my tardiness
in acknowledging your favor of the
23d Ult. but the delay has been [underline]partly[/underline]
occasion'd by my desire of making inquiry
for a situation for the person on
whose account you had the benevolence
to apply to me - The House-Keeper
which our dear Mrs LaTouche procur'd
for us soon after I took charge of the
House, is so clever in dressing food
as

as well as every other branch of her department
[insertion]here[/insertion] that nothing but being oblig'd to resign
her for her own advantage, wou'd be
likely to make me wish for any one else.
& I cannot hear of any situation for Mt
Murray. However, I have some expectation
of a visit from the lady of a Scotch Col: & I
[underline]hope[/underline] I shall then remember to speak of
M: M: tho' I wou'd not like to excite
in her any expectation from such an uncertain
source
I beg you to be assur'd, (in reply to
your inquiry) that I am far from consi[insertion]dering[/insertion]

it [underline]necessary[/underline] to "[underline]excuse[/underline] your taking the
"liberty" of writing to me - The humble
situation of a Charity-School Mistress
leaves very little [underline]below her[/underline] and I am
sure I attach great respectability to any
communication from you, Madam, & have
much pleasure in recv'g it -
Indeed I cannot but think the Ointment
you were so good as to furnish us with [underline]was very[/underline]
beneficial; but the appointment of an attending
surgeon, & his taking the heads under
[underline]his[/underline] superintendance, prevented my [underline]persevering[/underline]
in your remedy [underline]alone[/underline]
I did not know of [unclear]Co: Noulan[/unclear]'s being
subject to any swelling in her knee, untill
you

you mentioned it. I anxiously hope she is
going on satisfactorily, as J: Murphy
requesting to be kindly remembered to both,
with best respects to your daughters -
I remain
dear Madam
your oblig'd friend
H: Howell

Mrs Leadbeater
