My dear E
Betsy goes tomorrow
I shall miss her pleasant calls
tho' they were few - I saw
D Johnson who looks better
than before she lay in & is getting
on well tho still weak, she thinks
the cough has left her, I hope
thou wilt send her the honey
by next opportunity I think she
spoke of two quarts of strain'd
honey - E Gough is to go to
Waterford next month on trial
for 3 months - I hope she
may fill the situation agreeably

I was glad to hear that my
fathers was able to be down
stairs again I hope we shall
soon see him here - Margt.
seems pretty well she was out
to day for a very short time the
weather is so bitter cold that
I fear'd it for her, she speaks
of you very often, she wanted
to go show her shoes to [unclear]Grandada[/unclear]
& to buy sugar candy from
Mary Doyle she is getting
her own look again, I got
the apples safe for which I am
much obliged I believe thou owes
me now only 9 1/2 d when the
baking apples can be had
I would like to have some provided
they are a reasonable price
Betsy will tell you the news
how Joss Abell has ask'd for
Lydia Pim & is not likely
to obtain her & more I doubt
not I would like to be one
at the parlour fire listening
to her - my dear love to my
mother Margt. was greatly pleased
with her letter she got me to read it
twice over to her & said that
grandmama said "my dear
little Margaret" - John Pim is
not gone yet thy SB
