Dear Cousin
R. Shackleton/
I am unwilling to slip the present opportunity of informing thee that, tho tis now long since I writ, I have not forgot thee & the rest of my kind Friends in Ireland
Upon enquiry, I was told that none of your family was at London at the yearly Meeting, tho my sister had hinted in one of her Letters ^to me^ some time since that thy Father was expected to be there. should be glad to hear that no Indisposition of his or any of you had prevented his intended journey -- I have at last the satisfaction to inform you that we have good grounds to hope my poor Brother is become a much different Man from what he has been of late years; he is at Maiden Creek in America in a good Friends Family whose care, over, & great kindness towards him has under providence been the happy means of recovering him (he was once hopeful) - The Friend & his Wifes name are John and Eunice Starr --
Rachel Wilson at her return gave a good account of my Brother -- the Friend he is with (& whom both his Friends here & in America would have him continue) has confirmed the same account in a kind Letter to my Sister she has very lately received. - I know, dear Cousin, this will be agreeable news to you all, if you have not before heard where he is & how he goes in - My Husband & Children are all pretty well, we have five; 2 Boys & three girls, as to myself am but poorly, tho better than I have been, having never rightly recovered since I had my last child, a lovely Boy, now about 5 months old, we call him in Remembrance of my Dear Father, David Hall Dale
My indisposition obliged us to put him out to a wet Nurse but he goes on well thus far, & is the finest Child we have ever had, thou sees how I entertain thee with an Account of myself & Family, I hope thou wilt in return when Leisure & Inclination permit be as particular in giving me an Account of thy own -- I often read thy Letters over with great pleasure one in particular which seems to introduce me to an acquaintance with thy Wife & Children in whose welfare & happiness I am sincerely interested -- in that Letter of thine I can discern what sort of a Father thou art thyself, a kind indulgent one, & believe me, I speak from Experience that filial ties of gratitude & affection are much stronger than those imposed on us by a too severe Authority My Father was a kind one, & familiar with us, had he been otherwise I should have been not half so afraid to have offended him whilst living -- thy last Letter I received from the yearly meeting before this, by which I understood thy Worthy Father & Son had some thoughts of coming down into Yorkshire but I suppose were prevented or should have been very glad to have seen them both -- I hope thy son will be greatly serviceable to thee & is now I doubt not very capable to assist thee & lessen the great Fatigue naturally attending thy so numerous a Family & School I shall at all times be very glad to hear from thee & am joined by my Husband & Children in Love to thy Father thyself Wife & Children also thy sisters son and Aunt Bernard (if living) thy very affectionate
Friend & Kinswoman

P.S. I believe I may have told thee in some of my Letters that my Brother left 3 Children with his Wife two of which died near together of the small pox the oldest a very fine Boy is living with his Mother My Brother agreeable to his own strong Inclination as well as the Advice of his Friends has writ to Morris Birkbeck & given him full authority to take his son & send him over to him twill be a difficult Task to persuade his Mother &c to part with him I fear, as she must love the Child, yet in case fair Means wont effect it (which I should be glad of) my Brother has sent an Attorneys Letter -- I doubt not but it will be of great advantage to my dear little Nephew to be removed in time from where he is but am very anxious till the affair is over -- such violent Spirits to deal with, M. Birkbeck will Im afraid meet with severe Insults, at best, from the Family, they are fond of the Child; I wish it quietly over, & the Child safe in America, & Time I hope would make it easier to his Mother, at first it will be a hardship upon her
