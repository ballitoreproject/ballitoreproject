My beloved James
	++ Why should thou caution me against not to expose thy letter? I was rather pained by it. Dost thou think that because I am apt to share with some particular friends a portion, which I judge proper & pertinent for them, at times, from some letter which I receive, that I would make the feelings & effusions of such a heart & spirit as thine common? No - I think I may say I am as tender of thee as the apple of my eye. Thou art very near my best life, & oft remembered by me in the most desirable manner when very remote from thee - Thy dear sister is also among my choicest collection of friends - May this most trying dispensation of the dissolution of the tenderest natural tie be sanctified to her - & may the everlasting husband, father & friend be her comfort & support! +++ I wish thou may always be submissive & obedient to the restraining & propelling power of the Spirit - & then thou will be as happy as even I could wish thee to be - Salute for me, in the most affectionate manner, thy dear sister - Let her sorrows have vent - I trust they will not be inordinate, nor unlawful - & that [page number 226] they will be sweetened by him who alone can effectually sweeten every bitter cup - her poor child too! it will probably ere long make a glorious & happy exchange. Let us not then repine at the dealings of Infinite Wisdom & Goodness, who does all things perfectly well - we shall soon follow - & a very short time will level us all. To live acceptably while we are here - to do our duty in this life - & to seek to ensure an existence in a better which is to come - should be our principal solitude & anxious care. +++ Farewell, my dear James, I am assuredly & renewally
									thine	Richard Shackleton
