My dear Elizabeth
I have seen Mr Murray
this day and told him in your part
that you were ready to pay all the
rent you owe on [unclear]Dunggann[/unclear] and
deliver up possession of it. This notice
I understand is sufficient. Forbes
ought to be told to quit instantly if
he has not done so already and
I suppose it will be necessary for
you to send me [insertion]all[/insertion] the receipts for
the head rent and title up to this
day that I may have no
difficulty in the final settlement.
For which we must want Crogins
return to town I believe. Whoever
goes to pay the head rent ought to
try and get proper receipts for
has been paid and what is
to be paid, if they will not give
them for the front we must only
do as well as we can without them
Has Forbes paid his bill? If you chose
I can pay this rent and charge interest
for the same till funds come round

I send herewith a letter from Sarah
which I opened thinking to send with
but found no space, with dear love
I remain yours
affectionatly
EB
