My dear Cousin,
Castlecor: 7/6 month 1779.

					Though like a bird of quick passage, I would have endeavoured (I believe) to have sent thee a line before now, but that I had opportunity of sending thee accounts of our welfare by thy Father, Tommy Chandlee, &c. I now write by Billy Pike, to whom I refer thee for particulars of our Travel from Dungannon - he has been very kind, helpful & attentive to us. We have now been at (I think) every Meeting in Ulster, & have humbly to acknowledge gracious & sufficient help in necessary times - To that we cannot, if we speak at all of it, but speak well of the Service & of the Master - We got well to John Freeman's here last night after a long ride from Coolehill - My Wife & Sally Newland very tolerable after it. We purpose to go to morrow to Moat, thence to Ballimurry, & back to Moat to the Quarterly Meeting there - We would be glad to hear from thee, & to know how thou art, how poor John continues, how thy brother James & Son James are now, & indeed how ye all are; for indeed (whether a capacity for saying so is instant or not) ye are all very dear to us, & thy dear Father's attention & encouragement to us young pilgrims is not to be quickly forgotten - I cannot conveniently say more now than that our very dear love attends you all, & that I am my dear Debbys affectionate kinsman Richard Shackleton
