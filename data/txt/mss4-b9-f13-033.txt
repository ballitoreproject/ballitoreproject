Richmond 17th of 11th month 1828
My beloved Sarah
I little thought that my next letter to
thee, would be the bearer of such melancholy intelligence
the death of my uncle James, which took place
yesterday evening - he had been ill for about a
fortnight - a neglected cold - (he took to his bed
yesterday week from which he never rose) brought on - an inflamation
on his lungs & liver - his poor wife is
grievously to be felt for - she will be shortly confined
I hardly know what I write, but I feared thou
might hear inconsiderately of our loss, & that thou
might for even half a minute endure the anguish
of thinking it might be my dearest, so I thought
it better to write to thee & I request thou wilt write
a note to Charlotte Dawson who is at E. Allens informing
her of this sad event, lest she too might be alarmed.
Our dear uncle's close was sweet, peaceful, & calm, he had
given himself up for two days before, & most of these
days was engaged in serious discourse with his poor
wife, who has [insertion]has borne[/insertion] [deletion]bears[/deletion] up with great fortitude. She was exceedingly
attached to him - as indeed who was not
ceedingly attached to him - as indeed who was not
What knew him, even those less intimately connected
She attended him almost entirely herself, not allowing
any one else to assist her, & scarcely left his bedside
that sad week, until about an hour before his decease

when as he did not know her nor any one, she
was forced away, & soon after much into a sleep
which continued some hours after his decease
He lost one of his little twins about a month
ago. It was most awful yesterday - he lying with
all his faculties clear awaiting the awful call -
& we in breathless suspense & stillness - I never
passed such a day. - ah! how much I thought
of our beloved parents - I have borne keener
grief, but no feeling of sitting useless, expecting
such a dread event. My father of course
feels this stroke keenly - his only brother - the
only relative of the same standing as himself
the only link with his childish days & his
parents broken for ever - it is like the cutting
a thing between a past existence & the present.
Poor Sally is in great grief - she is gone in to
see the dear remains - my aunt Harvey appears
to bear it pretty well. - but I fear greatly the
effect it may have on her broken health &
wounded spirit - of course it must awaken
many painful feelings of the past - & poor
Thomas's death so recent. - Poor Hannah is
in great affliction. - Her health is better than it was

when she was in Dublin.
All our young ones are well - I cannot
give up the hope of seeing thee dearest Sarah
though now I can say little about it. I mean
to write to thee shortly With dear love to Edward
[deletion]and[/deletion] I am my dearest sister
Thy affct.
