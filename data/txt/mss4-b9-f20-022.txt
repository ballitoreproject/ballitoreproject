My dear E I was sorry not
to see thyself instead of thy
letter, but thy reasons are good
for not leaving home at present
I hope thoult come to
the meeting thou wd enjoy
seeing many of thy old
friends, I never know if was
necessary to ask permission
to leave the Post Office I
think it is a new rule
perhaps A Watt thought he
would have to take thy place
in thy absence, I sent thy

parcel to Limerick 9 months
ago by one of the Haggs who
very kindly call'd to ask
for my commands, I wonder
Lydia did not acknowledge
it, W.D. disappointed me
on 2nd day or that I have
not seen her to deliver
thy message to her, she is
greatly taken up with
M [unclear]Mucman[/unclear] who is very
delicate I wonder does
GS want the fields at the
back of the Inn, the rent
is running on if he shouldnt
want them we might [unclear][/unclear]
to some one else perhaps
Henry Allen I would be glad
thou'd say something of
[unclear]thou so[/unclear], Edw I believe
will soon write to thee
in answer to thy queries
he is very busy at present
as Richd is confined at
home with a heavy cold
these few last days
thy SB
