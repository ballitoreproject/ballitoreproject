Waterford Fourthmonth 9th 1794
I am obliged to my dear Cousin Mary
for her Kind Letter & much gratified by the
professions of friendship it contained - Indeed
Ballitore is the only place on which I had even
the shadow of a claim for friendship & if I were
disappointed I might consider myself an outcast
in reality - however let what may be, I
shall be far from harbouring any resentment against
thou who do not think proper to confer favours
even did I consider myself injured by any one
which is not the case, I think I should endeavour
to wipe it from my memory. I hope my Aunt
has ere now recovered from her indisposition - the
fine weather which we may expect may probably
be serviceable to her & enable her to get abroad
as

as heretofore. George Penrose has received a
Letter from the Widow Cassidy respecting money
she expected to receive from her son through
the hands of Capt. Sheppard - I request thou
may inform her that G&W Penrose had information
from her son that he had sent home
one Guinea by the said Gentleman - but that
he either forgot to neglected to pay it after he
came home - that we suppose he is now in
England & that inquiry shall be made as soon
as opportunity shall serve the result of which
she shall be acquainted with. Please let Cousin
Abraham Know if he thinks that piece of Furniture
would bear being transported such a distance
I should like to preserve it as a memorial of my
mother & would thank him to take advantage of
settled weather & get it sent forward as he may
think

think most advisable as much secured from damage
as convenient & I will with pleasure pay any
attending expense. Pray present me affectionately
to all Friends & believe me
Sincerely thine
William Rayner
