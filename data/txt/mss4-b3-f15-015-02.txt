From the same to the same, & to her sister Sarah [arah in pencil and pasted on slip] Grubb

Ballitore: 20th of 7th month 1791

My dear friend
++ Take care of thy body for the sake of thy mind, and take care of thy mind for the sake of thy friends - My eyes were very poorly at times while I was abroad, but they are tolerably just now. Welcome home, my dear cousin Sarah ^[pencil] Sarah^, I am glad that thou and thy Elizabeth [name in mixture of pen and pencil, on slip pasted onto letter] are returned in safety to complete the family, a family which I trust Almighty Goodness is hovering over, hath blessed, doth bless and will bless, if there be an humble, patient, looking and turning towards him, if there be a total unreserved dedication of and surrender of all to his will, and if there be a faithful obedience to all his requirings. And, indeed, it appears to be me, dear cousin, that these fruits are in a good measure brought forth in and by thee, and I wish thee to be encouraged to perseverance in the right way, to follow on to know [page number] 242 the Lord in the successive openings of his heavenly counsel, and then i doubt not but thou will see still greater things than these [sic] which thou hast already seen - The Master has come and called for thee, and thou hast happily obeyed the call. Mayst thou ever prize his precious visitation to thy spirit as a capital blessing! May nothing of this world ever come in competition with it, but mayst thou to the end prefer Jerusalem above thy chief joy! Excuse my comprising thee in this manner in my letter to Betty - the salutation came suddenly and without premeditation - and besides, to my great comfort, ye are so one in my view, in my esteem estimation and in my affection that I feel no impropriety in uniting you in the same address. Make your little flock sensible of my love and good wishes for them +++ My wife joins very cordially in true affection to you all. Ye know my children are incorporated with you.
	May ye, my beloved friends, Farewell
		Richard Shackleton
