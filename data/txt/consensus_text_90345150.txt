29th. Before [insertion]we[/insertion] were out of our room this
morning Papa knocked at our door
and told us the fleet was in and to
get ready at once to go - that put us
all in a bustle. They were all gone
before half past eight, I think; Papa,
Mama, Ellen and Liddy, I thought it
better to stay and mind the place -
and a nice quiet day I had too -
Tea all alone as Philip took his at
Ballyman. Beautiful day for her
Majesty.
30th Had a very pleasant ride after
dinner with Philip - We heard some
rumour about the Queen's paying
a flying visit to this part of the
country, but saw no sign of her when
we were out. Papa, Mama, and
Mary Strangman came out after
tea [insertion]bringing[/insertion] [unclear][/unclear] full [insertion]acct.s[/insertion] of the Queen and all the
bustle and variety. Polly sent me
a long letter and wanted me to go in
to them soon which I hope to do -
