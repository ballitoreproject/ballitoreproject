after tea.
22nd.. Papa staid out to day also which
is very pleasant indeed. After tea
Liddy and I went up with [deletion]t[/deletion]him to the
top of the hill opposite the house, from
which we had a fine view of one of
the prettiest sunsets I have seen this
long time. Papa was singing one
of Moores melodies which was partly
applicable to the pretty scene -
Charlie came out to tea.
x 23rd. First day. Went to meeting with Papa
+ Mama, brought Georgina back with us
as we want to have her on a little picnic
we are going to have to the co Wicklow on next
Wednesday, if every thing permits.
I saw M Shackleton at Ballitore Cottage,
the first time since her return to this
country. T Chandler was there also
paying her a visit I suppose.
I got an answer to an invitation I sent
the Thifts saying they would join us, so
we expect them to tea on 3rd day evening
