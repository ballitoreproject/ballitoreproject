Tuesday
Dearest Wife
I have not
much to say nor
much time - as
I am going to
Belfast - I got
your note this
morning & was
glad to hear that
Sidney was better
I hope the other
Boys ailment may
not signify -
I wish you were
home - I am very
very lonely and
am more so, than
I felt at first -
The frost is very
keen here to-day
- the river in some
parts bears boys

sliding on it and
we may commence
skating any time.
I shall not have
any time to write
this evening - as
I am going to
Mrs. Hayes's & must
be there early -
I shall be looking
forward with
pleasure for
Saturday - I hope
you will be ready
to come home on
Monday - I cannot
remain & if you
can come by
the 1 o'c train, all
the better -
I feel so cold
at night that I
have had to put
extra clothes on
I hope your father
is better - In haste
your very attached
husband

The windows are
all cleaned -
I am getting the
Bell put up to the
servant's room -
