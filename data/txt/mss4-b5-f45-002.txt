Thee will have the goodness to send
me by my little boy afew Weeks
allowances for the boys, not to be
troubling you every week
There is one thing that I have
to inform thee, that has given me
[underline]much [/underline]concern, my Circumstances
are such that I was under the
disagreable necessity of sending
my Wife and my two little
Boys this Harvest to Work for
their Victuals - When the
year has expired I will send thee
an exact account of the returns
of the School that you may see
what I had to support myself
and family upon, my Wife & me
had strong hopes since we came
here that we both would be encouraged
to teach on the Lancasterian
System, but our hopes are now
allmost expired, for without your
kind assisting hand we must give
up all thoughts of that excellent plan
Your much Obliged
and
Humble. Servant

After the trouble you had
on accoubt of my Watch. For which I
return thee my sincere thanks. the
[underline]man[/underline] left it out of his hands as he
received it, only he changed one of
the hands and put on [underline]and[/underline] that
does not answer it. I left 1 ea 8
for him as thee were not at home
if he charged more, thee can stop it
from the weekly Premium, as I have
paid the Boys. the two first weeks
allowance. These children that
allowance. The children that
are conveniant to the School on
account of the Premium attend
much earlier than usual
