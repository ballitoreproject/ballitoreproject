My dear friend
Thy few lines were very acceptable,
but would have been more so if
they were more numerous.
I have now Prior's Life of Burke; -
& must acknowledge that it has raised
my opinion of the intellectual power &
excellent moral character of thy old
friend; though I also think that he
has [insertion]been[/insertion] most egresiously guilty of the common
sin of biographers - inordinate partiality.
He vainly endeavors to show the [unclear]consistency[/unclear]
of Burke's political life & principles, &
that his party forsook him, not he them.
Now I think the utmost that can be
conceded in [insertion]his[/insertion] favor, is that the French
Revolution frightened him out of his sober
senses, & made him forget former principles,
Mary Leadbeater

friendships & all. - Prior also endeavours
to them upon Fox the odium of the lamentable
breach of Friendship between then
two great men; but since I finished the work,
I have read a report of the debate at which
that occurrence took place, - I could not but
admire the candour, manliness & warmth of
friendship of Fox, while I regretted the disingenuousness,
sophistry & petty irritability of
Burke. There was not a single expression
in what Fox said to justify Burke's charges
against him of [underline]malignant [/underline] enmity, & far less
[insertion]to constitute[/insertion] a fair ground for breach of friendship. Excuse
these free observations on the [insertion]public[/insertion] character
of thy friend - I am not insensible to
his many noble & excellent qualities both
of head & heart.
I have sent the work by b' Driscol,
(whom I met accidentally in London) to
the care of my brother James. -
I received a note from Prior a few
nights ago requesting me to forward the
work, & requesting me to call upon him
at Brixton some evening, which I think
I shall do, & have a feast with him
upon Burke's character. -
I shall be glad to have a letter from
thee at any time. With love to uncle L.
aunt Sally [unclear][/unclear]
I remain affectionately
Thomas Fisher
Whenever I can do any thing for thee in
London, do not scruple to commission me, -
as I have even [underline]more[/underline] time upon my hands
than I wish for.
