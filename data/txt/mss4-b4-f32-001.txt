Richmond 14th of 5th - month 1823
My dear Eben,
I sit down to talk to thee as I often did before - but alas
this time I have little or nothing to say yet never fear me I will make out
something - whether sense or nonsense - no matter if it conveys to thee the
intelligence of my own good & my father's better health. I need not tell
thee that thy letter brought me pleasure even though it told me again of
Deborah's delicacy - but I have such faith in Dr Harvey - in the fine weather
in Sarah's company & in Miriam's smiles that I feel less than commonly
anxious about her - George tells Hannah that you had an auction of
some of your stock that you may be free to travel during the summer
You will come here I hope - but I will say nothing about this until I see you
which happy time is not now, we hope, far distant. - Oh! be joyful.
Our life is so quiet & one day is exactly like the last, except as it is varied
by my fathers health & the books we read - that I have little news to tell
or little to make my letters interesting except so far as telleth of ourselves
this indeed I will not pretend to think otherwise [insertion]than[/insertion] as a very gay interesting
jolly jovial lively hearty subject. My father Jr is something
better so much so that we hope the month after next will see George
& Hannah standing before the monthly meeting & declaring in public
the existence of their 11 month's love Bravo! Oh! my heart! the
trembling in their little frames! Now as to the reading - we are
at present engaged over a round Table " circled by other Knights than
those of you - these wage war against ignorance & false taste - those
against what sometimes virtue sometimes evil & often only against
steel doughty warriers! renowned heroes - & yet we love their old
romance - I dont know whether thou does - but I do - but to my
subject - after all this fine palaver - This Round Table is simply
a book written by Leigh Hunt & Hazlett & leaving the different
stamp & character of their genius - James got it by chance at
the library - for the name had not invited us & we are both greatly
pleased with it & think thou would like it also - Thats all I
have to say. So thou likes Owen - every one here is delighted with
thine Edward's & Betsy 's adaption of his views - Uncle James
declares he will grow proud in the strength of it - he is so glad
to have you of his own opinion - my father quietly thinks
-itical acconting work not at first [insertion]view[/insertion] appear to be in unison with the convictions
of one who looked with favorable eyes on [insertion]the[/insertion] pages of Adam Smith, Ricardo
or Mrs- I forgot her name - the learned lady, renowned for her dialogues-
Yet in reflection, as far as I know of Viven's views of civil policy they are
not by any means in contradiction to those great lights, but rather what they
would think if they had contemplated the state of things which Owen now
sees that is the great political paradox which Lord Liverpool was laughed
at for promising - that our distresses proceed from over production - and
that while a painful super abundance of food really exists in the country
over the demand - thousands are ready to perish for want - this was the
case last summer - it is not so much so just now - but it will recur again
and again unless some[underline] radical[/underline] change takes place in the system of things -
I write to Thomas in great triumph that you & our brother Edwd & Betsy
your sister were approvers and applauders of Owen and his scheme which
I expect will not altogether delight some for he is remarkable for the bitterness
of his dislike to Owen as a man, a philosopher and a philanthropist.
He scarce will allow him to he any thing that is good & condemns his motives
no less than his actions and words - Thomas is absurd in his angerlike
the holy disturbers of tha peace at Owen's meeting - Less hes mentioned
the round table - I should like to read it for you - The philosophic essays for

no one of sense & reason & unprejudiced judgment could think otherwise
than partially with Owen. James will [insertion]tell [/insertion]you what he thinks, himself.
Oh! my own darling Deborah why dont I say a word to thee - why dont I tell
thee that I am longing to see thee Sarah & that darling infant & why
dont I tell thee what I know will give thee so much pleasure that
I hope to see you next month - We are planning to go to Dublin first
& from that joined by Edward & Sarah & Miriam, the sweet! to go to
dear Ballitore I will write to Edward all about it nearer the time
Oh that I may soon pen that joyous letter! And I am thinking for
I am ever plotting & planning - that if Sarah can make room - that
Thou & Eben should meet us there - I am afraid she can't but sure
If so she can say so & there will be no harm done. My heart bounds
when I think of it & how pleasant, how enchanting to see your dear
faces again. Oh nobody can know what a meeting is without a weary
parting. - And my dearest Debs how art thou? Why dont thou join in
one of Eben's letters - the sight of thy hand writing would be very pleasant
Oh dont thou remember about this time twelvemonth after I had left
Sarah after the yearly meeting - how I surprised thee in the Garden
& how rejoiced thou wert to see me the only warm welcome I got
except my mother's & Eben's - Oh! with what rapture I look on those days
& forget how bitterly they were marred with pain - & these days that
are flying on halcyon wings - never bearing a pang but the thought
that I am from you, & that thou still dressed my own beloved sister
these days fly in - unmastred - but not unthanked, & I am longing
till they bring others still dearer - I had a mighty pleasant letter
from Edward which I was grateful for & which I intend to reply to
when I have [underline]the[/underline] good news to tell & I had a dear note from my
[underline]dearest[/underline] Sarah (mind that [underline]dearest[/underline], Sal) tellling me about Miriam
& brought her so before my eyes that I could not help crying with
delight. Oh! the darling child I long to see her. - Have you been
at the lovely Glen & how are its inhabitants I would wish my
dear love to be given to Eliza & tell her I was greatly disappointed
not to get a letter from her by the meeting & that will I write again
to her & scold her if she dont write to me - Maybe she is ill.
you Eben, and the remarks on the old poets for you my dear Debs Have
you seen the third number of the Liberal - we have not, for not even the
first number has reached our Boeotian atmosphere. Byron has lately
published a satirical poem call Carmen Seculare or the Age of Bronze
it is advertized in the Scotsman which I send you - I should like to see it &
compare it with his early effort of Satire, which if it equals it must be excellent
Rogers has just published part of the result of his late travels in a
poem called Italy - blank verse - but said to exceed in strength and equal in
harmony his Human Life as much as Human Life excels the Pleasure of
Memory. Tell Betsy this last piece of intelligence as she is an admirer of
the Human Life - I am intentioned with Smiths Theory of Moral Sentiment,
and it has supplied me with a crowd of new ideas - more food for thought -
When commence you the grand Tour? - These moving armies seem to proscribe
continental rambles - what think you of Asia, Africa or America -
the last seems the easiest, and an autumnal visit to our friend Morris
Birbeck and a peep at Niagara in the circuit if your route home would
give pleasant food for an evening conversation next spring - when you
call on us on your road to Ballitore from Boston or New York - I wish
Edwd Barrington's scheme could be put in execution, as it easily might - nothing
simpler or easier - accept crossing the Atlantic which to be sure is the easier

If so dont reproach her but tell her my marriage has not altered my
affections except that they are expanded for I love all my old friends
better, I think, than ever I did. Please give my love to John & Margaret
& all the girls & some of the boys indeed to all & tell me how
the Glen & the mountains look. Oh! dost thou remember the first
view got of it in the morning after we got there & how delighted
I was all was so calm & beautiful - I am still throwing my backward
loo[deletion]c[/deletion]ks. "To turn our thoughts whene'er we love" To those we've left behind us" why
then. It is a myhty pleasant thing to the doing James is interesting
me so much - he is gone Hannah & Sally send their love to their sister
in law - ie [underline]thee[/underline] my dear whatever they mean by this - this is a fine [unclear][/unclear]
Chess my dearest Eben it is long. since I said a word to thee except as joint
stock. And I have nothing - my father is come down stairs again - this
moment 12 o'clock. I am sitting in full view of a most luxuriant show
of tulips. How does your garden grow? I intend to write to Sarah soon
How is Elize? She must feel lonesome without
the dairy - but I suppose she is enjoying the
thoughts of travelling - & will have the house
delicately clean in your return from Dublin
Give my love to her & tell her how we are talking of going to you
& she will be delighted. I hear James Pim's second eldest son of
Mountmellick has [unclear]liked[/unclear] for Hannah Deaves - so much for
news. I will leave you for today & James will finish this for
tomorrow's post - ever ever your own affectionate L J Fisher.
My dearest love to Sarah & Edward. There ought to be a common
word you know if the common gender as grammarians
say, to express equally brother or sister that I might call [deletion]it[/deletion]
you jointly by the endearing name instead of saying as
now say. My dear brother Eben & my dear sister Debs &
Lyds I see how very quietly resigned to my pen more thus
half the blackening if this sheet, I suppose with the same
licence that she took herself to cover it with sense or nonsense
whichever must prevail at the present in my cranium,
thing now-a-days - Edwd proposes that he & Sarah Lyon & Debs should
come pay us a visit next summer or autumn & that we should [deletion]should[/deletion]
accompany you to Killarney from this, 40 miles. A coach is to run
from this on the 5th July - and if it carries six inside it would be
delightful - but being six we need not doubt for conveyances galore - that
would start up like Neptune's horse with a stroke not of an iron trident
indeed but of a gold sovereign. We shall talk about it when we see you
which I hope will be some time next month - next month! I can scarce
believe it & I look forward to my summer visit with scarce less delight than
I used when you will admit I had a stronger selfish attraction. My dearest
Debs the leaves are on the trees since we last wrote to you and the delightful season
is come the flowery spring this time of promise - the laburnums & lilacs nodding
their beauties & shedding their perfume and the roses are budding & will soon be
blowing - it is the happiest season of the year - "when every sense and every
heart is joy". We have had some storms and showers deforming the day delightless
but I hope such fine weather will be soon. Lydia has thought even our
western flowers worthy her care and takes a good deal of pleasure in watching
& caring for the garden - and the green house with its inhabitants. We had a
notice from Thomas that he is in Edinburgh and to stay there some weeks - he
is at John Rickman's 135 Princes St and so is his Sarah. We do not know
what he intends to do with himself - I have this last page for Lyds - farewell dearest E&D

James left me but little
room - & yet enough -
If James looks forward
to our meeting with
such pleasure what
must be my feelings.
I am uneasy at not
hearing from home
it is now nearly three
weeks since I had a

& Eben's letter was the
last beside - more
than a week ago
Thomas sent me
Sarah Godlee's profile

handsomer than
the original - than

The nose is long
the mouth & chin
pretty & the countenance
sensible & intelligent
but mortal men must mut mortal interruptions - it is
night, my candle dim, my eyes ditto - for it is bed time, so good
-bye fratello e sorella cara e cara! [unclear][/unclear]eth el was glad to hear
that Eben attended Owen's meeting and was not among the
[underline]learned[/underline] hissers, surely fraught with collegiate reasoning viz
noise and clamour and with Christian charity of their own
sort from the bosom of alma Mater. Well, Eben, you are
among the applauders and approvers of the words I did
not think that is, I was not certain whether you would
be satisfied with Owen's doctrines. It is true that Edward
[unclear]trove[/unclear] seems to be his grand Panacea - and in this I knew
you would join him even though his doctrines are said
to tend towards [underline]Fatalism[/underline] - this is my profound brother
the Doctor's objection to shame. But Owen's opinions on pol-
