			A. S. to his Grand-daughter Margaret

					Dublin, 5th of Fifthmonth `770.
				â€œMy mind is mostly centered among those who are begging their bread; and would rather be honestly poor, than filled with unwholesome food, and lose my appetite for that which nourishes the soul up to eternal life. At times I thankfully acknowledge, to the praise of the bountiful hand that satisfies the hungry babes with proper sustenance, I have partaken with the poor of the flock, of what keeps me from fainting, and encouraged to hold on my way in watchful fear.
	I long that you may be watchful, and grow in the root of life: there is true and real comfort to be experienced. My love and best wishes attend you all.	Thy affectionate grandfather,
											A. S.
