From Richard Shackleton to Sarah Neale

Dear friend,
	I am favoured with thine, & hold myself much obliged to thee for thy friendly intelligence about thy dear husbands departure. It was very kind of thee to write, & deserved a quicker reply on my part, but a variety of engagements super-added to my ordinary busy employment prevented. It is a very pleasing circumstance that the wind & weather seem to have been so favourable to his voyage, & I hope it will not be long now till we heard of his having had a safe & ready passage ^[to America]^. Thou had indeed just right & title, both on thy own account & thy partners, to the attention & conversation of your common friends. Thou hast freely given up thy beloved Consort, & ventured thy dearest possession among all the casualties which attend this uncertain life, to labour in body & spirit in a remote part of the world. The cause for which he labours, the cause of Christianity, is the most glorious upon earth, & as he is enabled to persevere, & preserved by divine Goodness in the way of his duty, glorious no doubt will be his reward. And thou also, dear friend, in this state of temporary widowhood; trusting daily in the Lord, & diligently waiting upon him for thy supply of daily food to thy soul, wilt (I believe) experience that his good Spirit goeth with them that go forth in his service, & stayeth with them that stay, whose minds are truly stayed upon him. Living here, keeping to the word of patience, & being resigned in simplicity to do every little thing in thy power for the same cause, according to the gentle drawings of an inward sense of duty, thou wilt share the precious spoil of Divine Favour with thy husband, & more & more partake of that Blessed Communion & holy fellowship enjoyed by the Saints in Light. It is a day, my friend, in which there is no room for the visited of the Lord to be idle. If they are not diligent & watchful in spirit, there is a subtle, indefatigable adversary, who is ready to pick out the good seed sown in the heart of by thy ^the^ good husbandman (the benefit of the heavenly visitation) & to sow his evil seed in its stead. Let us therefore [five words crossed out] use all diligence not only to preserve, but to cultivate & improve these precious visits of saving Grace, that we may be enabled to walk acceptably before God, feeling from time to time an earnest of his favour, & to discharge with propriety & faithfulness those relative duties which in our several spheres we owe to the religious society of which we are members in general, & to our several connexions in particular. +++ Be assured a line from thee is always particularly pleasing to me, & accepted ^of^ as a particular favour by
	thy sincere, affectionate friend
