Much Esteemed
and Dear Friend
	Thy kind Letter to my Dear Mother was & is truely acceptable to us all, and could she have wrote her self would not have been so long unanswered, for she has often expressed her desire to have it done, feeling much nearness to thee and thine, as indeed do we all and rejoiced in thy preservation, and safe conducting to thy desired ^earthly^ rest. - my Dear Mother is I think as well, as when thou saw ^her^, which is a great favor, and the different parts of our families, are also much as usual, this favor is I trust all your ^present^ experience. - by accounts from Dear Sister Deborah thy are favored with health, and accompanied by the never failing support under and thro their varied exercises, and are now ^in^ Cornwall, had safe passage to ^& from^ Dunkirk and Guernsey, but ^in going^ to the Latter very trying being five days and nights before ^they^ reached that place, they were also at Jersey, and had public meetings there also to satisfaction, this last place ^was^ very full of French people - suppose the Dear Friends from your Land are on their way to Dunkirk, the very confused situation of the French People makes it appear trying to approach their coast, but there is no doubt, as they keep to their inward director, they will witness preservations; - we have lately had the satisfaction of some of our Esteemed ^Friend^ William Roach and his daughter Lydias [sic] ^company^, he is a choice man, he went pretty direct for London in order to accompany Amistia [?] Hustler and Martah Routh over to Dunkirk so this appears to be a favorite spot of Heaven since so many dignified servants are sent to proclaim the Gospel amongst them, surely light is bursting forth in a wonderful manner upon that people - I believe Brother Reynolds has received an account from William Roach of their getting safe over - Elizabeth Minchin and Ann Baker are now here, they have ^been^ thro Wales on a religious Visit - at Llanidloes a School for Friends children is now began by subscription, being through to be the most likely means to help the very low state of the society in those parts, many of the children being brought up without being able to read. -
	We are informed South Wales is likely to have some Friends to make in adition [sic] to their Small numbers from Nantucket, to settle near Haverford West, which our friend William Roach confirmed, his wifes Brother being one of the Number, but that he expected there would only be a few families, this feels pleasant to us, ^tho few in number.^ and sincerely desire it may be productive of mutual good, hoping they are of those who are ^strong in the Principal -^
	My Mother Sister Rathbone, Brother Samuel and S Appleby all unite with me in dear love to thee thy wife and children - from thy assured Friend Sarah Darby -
our ^love^ to any friends to whom it may be acceptable.
Martha Haworth and P. Gurney are now we believe in Somersetshire or Cornwall -
Thy letters are always truely acceptable to us hope we shall be favored to hear from thee -
Aunt Barnard continues very poorly, and desires her love -
