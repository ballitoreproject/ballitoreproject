My dear Father
It would be a great gratification to me
to take an excursion to Clonmell & a greater to be favd.
with so much of thy company as I would thereby be
likely to enjoy, but our present situation & several
attendant circumstances seem to combine against
me at this time - Debby wishes to pay her intended
visit to MtMellick previous to MtRath meeting &
as I wish to contribute every thing in my Power to
her Satisfaction I intend accompanying [insertion]her[/insertion] there. I
hope thou wilt kindly excuse me at this time for
not waiting on thee & believe (as is really the case)
it is a considerable disappointment to me - We hope
to hear (per bearer returning) a good Acct. of you all &
how Poor Martin & family are & whether you have
heard anything new from Sally Haughton - Our
Dear Love & Duty (as it ought) attend you -
Thine
Thos. Chandlee
