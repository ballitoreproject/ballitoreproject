to think of it.
30 Friday: Papa had two letters from Thomas
saying that poor Polly had felt it very
much and was quite knocked up, but

31 Saturday Philip breakfasted with us (- I
dined with him yesterday) He came over
to learn what arrangements had been made
about my going down to Orange Hill.
Not going till Monday - Had a
letter from Polly - She wrote so resignedly
letter from Polly - She wrote as resignedly
it relieved my mind to know that she
had found consolation, dear Polly!
her's was a hard trial. The Little one
was buried yesterday morning at Moyallen
Thomas, Ned Avy, the Doctor, Nurse, and Jane
formed the funeral group - Poor Susan
his maid is in great grief -
This is New Year's eve - Here I am up
in my own little room scribbling this 10Â½
O'clock - just going to bed - Where shall I be this
day year - May the New year be blessed to us

May Charlie and Philip
be happy and blessed
in their choices, Louisa
and Bessie - oh may
may they have [underline]every[/underline] happiness
and I beseech thee Oh Heavenly Father
to make dear Papa happy truly happy
lighten his earthly cares for he has
many of them: - and help our
poor absent brother, let fortune
smile on him at last -
and for all my other dear
brothers and sisters I humbly
crave a blessing -
Farewell 1869
He wants me to go down - And I intend to
