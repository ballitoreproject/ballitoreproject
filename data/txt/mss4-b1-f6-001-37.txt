My dear Bob,
I received your agreeable favour of the 8th of
April last, I should rather say disagreeable, when it informed
me of the loss of a worthy & sincere friend; whom from my heart
I am sorry & do sincerely sympathize with Mrs. Eyre in the
loss of so good a husband & protector to herself & large family -
we have not now left a man of the name of Eyre who has courage
or honesty enough to see justice [insertion]& equity[/insertion] done to three orphans, two of
which from their profession may never be able & a third
(yourself) not supported. - For God's sake, has all kind of honesty,
religion, laws, & forms left your country, that the property of
men serving his Majesty in foreign countries & yourself intending
the same, is seized, no rents paid, no settlement for
near thirteen years of our property, or arrears thereon? if ever
I live to see Great-Britain, if I was forc'd to sell my commission,
I'll prosecute the perpetrators of such unwarrantable acts
to the utmost extent of the law - I should thank you,
my dear Bob, if you will give me in your next a short detail
of our property and in general; does not the Lord Mayor do
any thing with our affairs? in short I believe we have no
friend, but that good man Mr. Pelly, who I hope you will
let know how much I esteem him: I wish the whole was in his hands
