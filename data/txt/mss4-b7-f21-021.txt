Mont Coniston Feb: 6th- 1804
Your kind letter, my dear Friend, found me in Derbyshire
with my friend Lady Bradford, with whom I pass'd 14 Weeks most
pleasantly; & with all the comfort which affection, Wealth, Elegance,
& [underline]refined[/underline] Society could bestow — do you not tremble for me!
& think I must ill brook a return to my Cottage, with the
necessaries of life only; & surrounded by a set of honest, well-
meaning persons, who indeed, I believe, have every disposition
to serve, but without the power of amusing me — My two
Eldest Daughters taken from me too, so that my abode is become
an almost solitary one - In alone being left. Thank
God! I can tell you — & with sincerity — that tho' I gratefully enjoy'd
my visit, I am perfectly contented with my home; indeed
I so naturally relapsed into my former habits, that it seems
to me as if I had been blest with a pleasing Dream for 14 Weeks,
which recruited my Spirits, & fitted them the better to encounter
[unclear]future[/unclear] difficulties. It was not in human nature to be [underline]insensible[/underline]
to the change, but my Body felt it much more than my
Mind; for the excessive, & incessant Rains have made my damp
Cottage threefold wet, & I have been really ill, confined to my
house for upwards of a fortnight; I am now recovering, & if it
ever ceases from raining, I expect air & exercise will soon patch me
up again.

I was not allow'd to leave Derbyshire, without giving up two Dautrs.
as Hostages for my joining Lady B. in the Spring at Bath, & they
will return home; - as I love my dear Lady with no [underline]common[/underline] affection,
I delight in having my Children with her, & [insertion]in[/insertion] being with her my[unclear]self[/unclear]
yet I find that my absence is prejudicial to my farming concerns,
in spite of all faithful Turpin's care & attention; for I never yet
met with a Man, who would allow that a Woman could understand
anything of Agricultural affairs, so that all her good advice was [unclear]not[/unclear]
for nothing — Our worthy friend Thos. Wilkinson tells me that he has
assured you of his existence; & I can bear testimony to his apparent
good health - he was so kind as to pass nearly three days with
me, immediately on my coming home; the Weather was too bad
for us ever to look out of the house, but the time pass'd pleasantly,
for Thomas's genuine native taste on all subjects, his extreme
good sense, & perfectly guileless heart, makes him always to me
a most welcome Guest. We spoke of you, & I leave you to suppose
in [underline]what terms[/underline] - I am truly concern'd that pain or sorrow of any
kind should approach the amiable Lydia; I do not know - nor
can I learn what a [underline]bustion[/underline] is, but I conclude it must be of the
nature of a Whitloe; I hope she is now well, & as happy as I
sincerely wish her to be — Of your Country, my dear Friend, - of my
Country - or indeed of [underline]any Country[/underline] - what can I say - but that the Times
are truly awful! The Scourge of the World seems at present triumphant,-
but there is a Greater Power who can arrest his Course, & say
"thus far shalt thou go, & no farther" — in that Power alone, do I trust!

for all human probability fights against us, & vain is the help of
Man, yet it is our duty to exert our own efforts in combating Evil of
every kind. I do not feel dismay'd, & am resolved to feed my own pasture
to the last — then, welcome Guillotine rather than live the Slave of
[unclear][/unclear] Bonaparte. - Your Country, or rather Countrymen, I apprehend are those
on whom the Tyrant founds his best hopes, & I [underline]wish[/underline] rather than [underline]expect[/underline]
that he may be mistaken; - I trust you know that I highly Esteem
& regard some Individuals - but as a Nation I have no confidence in it.
I pray God that You, & my little Circle of Friends at Ballitore, may
be preserved from both external & internal Foes! The seizure of
Dwyer I should hope would make you in less danger of suffering from
Nightly depredators — I would not exchange the sweet security this
spot affords, for the best Estate in your Neighbourhood; frequently my
House door is neither barr;d or lock'd - I am out at all hours secure -
My Girls in Summer, ramble amongst the distant Mountains, &
oft return at 10 o'clock at night, - I feel no uneasiness at their absence,
because I know it is a chance if they meet with any one, & if they shod.
they would only exchange a kind word in passing — I flatter myself
we strongly resemble the ancient Swiss, nothing can be more Independent,
more honest, or more simple in their Manner than my
Neighbours, - I love them, & am [underline]proud[/underline] of them! — I suppose the exercise
of the Faculties wears the Body, & that your worthy Mother lives
the longer from the total deprivation of hers. She affords an awful
lesson of Humility, & teaches us not to value ourselves on talents or
acquirements, for I understand she once eminently possessed both! —
Sally is a good Creature! & will I trust be rewarded both here & hereafter;
here, - by the satisfaction of reflecting on a conscientious discharge of
Duty, - thereafter, by the approbation of a merciful Father.

The School & the Inn, both have my good wishes; it must be great
comfort to you to be able to have your Children well Educated, under your
own inspection, - how many does [underline]your[/underline] Stock consist of? does my favorite
[underline]Richard[/underline] promise to prove himself a worthy Descendant of his amiable
Grdfather's? Does Thos. Bewley's Business prosper? I hope Fanny's little
Idol is the image of herself - Does poor Susan find her little cottage comfortable? -
but alas! She does not find honest Mary in it! You must tell
me everything about my kind Friends, for I am interested about them all.
You do not name Anne Taverner, so I hope she is better than usual.-
Ye are all very good to poor Brian, & so ye are to [underline]all[/underline] who need your
assistance, - If I shod. ever be reduced to Beggary (& of course possess nothing
that any Miscreant wod. think worth taking [insertion]from[/insertion] [deletion]of[/deletion] me) I would come
& ask Charity at Ballitore — The Captain has been sometime
Recruiting at Leeds, I expect to see him in a few days — The first
Recruit he Enlisted, had been a member of your Society, some of whom
interested themselves so much in his behalf, that I understand a
[unclear]quondam[/unclear] dislocation of his Shoulder was admitted as a sufficient cause
for his discharge, & he is return'd to his Home, & former employment of
a Schoolmaster. I travell'd for three days together last Spring, with
one of your Society, who entirely gain'd my Esteem & affection, no
wonder! for she greatly reminded me of dear Lydia - her name is
Lloyd, & her Husband is a Banker at Birmingham. That you may
not think I always send you a short letter, I have chatted with you -
- as I was always pleased to do [underline]personally[/underline] — at great length - God only
knows what of Good or Evil will befall us in the course of this year,-
but I am sure I very earnestly wish all that is good to you, & yours — for
Remember my Ltrs are always to be [underline]burnt[/underline] —
I am very Sincerely Yr Friend
[unclear]JS[/unclear]
