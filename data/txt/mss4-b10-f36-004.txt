4th day night or 5th day morning
one oclock just [underline]struck[/underline]
My dear Eliza
I did not get thy
note or my Mothers untill
John came home to his dinner
& then I had not time
to write [insertion]by[/insertion] R who was going almost
immediately. I may now tell
thee what we have been doing.
On seventh day as I told thee
we went to the Zoological Garden's
I was greatly pleased with
them. there are three times
the number of beasts now, than
what I saw before they are also
in much better condition.
We had the Savages & Ed- & Sarah
in the evening, it was pleasant
enough. first day we were at
home all [underline]alone[/underline]. Second Martha

& I set off to Abbots-town
we had a delightful day and
enjoyed ourselves very much
I believe thou wert there so
I am spared a description of it.
T Robinson dined here he is
just the same old thing. third
day went to breakfast at my
Aunt G's. & afterwards met Martha
at [underline]Yates[/underline] in College Green from
whence we went up Grafton
street for patterns of [unclear]Castameces[/unclear] &
to look at the people, it was
very dirty so that we had not by
any means a clean walk.
John took us to see the microscope
after tea, what we saw
was very interesting, only two
short a time the whole sight
being over in the space of half
an hour. 4th day breakfasted
at Nicholas Street. came home
& set off with M in the car to
Rathmines after stopping
there a short time too, a
drive by some new roads &
home to dinner, went to tea
to Britain St where we met
the Savages. & S.M. and we have
now just come home & I
before going to bed (tho' I believe
it is near one) have sat down
& scribbled this to thee
that I may have it
ready in the morning
to send by Sarah who says
she is going to the Glen. Our
Pelisses are come home
they were two long & I sent
them both to be altered. I hope
thine may do. It was very
kind for HP to ask you there
I am glad you went. I would like
to meet J Pease, but hardly expect
to do so. So [underline]TEH[/underline] is thoroughly [underline]polite[/underline]
thou did not mention whether
Olivia appeared or not.
I may tell thee to write soon tho' we are
going to change places. farewell & with dear
love to my Mother & self I am
thy affect. sister
Selina
tell my Mother that there is a [unclear][/unclear]
blanket in Freds bed.
