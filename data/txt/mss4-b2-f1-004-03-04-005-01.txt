Kilconner 6th of 9th month 1783 
My dear James, 
        ++ This day week I was here at the funeral of poor John Watson ^[pencil] John Watson^ late of this place - Many symptoms of a rectified spirit appeared about him at [pg number] 210 the close, full of love to his best friends, very desirous for the welfare of this meeting, & its being properly kept up, wishing, I suppose only to live longer that he might live a better example, ordering that all respecting him & his funeral should be plain & friendlike, & that his children should be brought up in strict plainness - his brother Robert [added on slip] who had come about two weeks before with his wife & child was, at the time of the funeral, which was silent & solemn, much indisposed keeping his bed - he desired to see me, & I thought it very agreeable, sitting by him, & found a freedom of communication both with him in one chamber, & the recent young widow in another - At that time I hoped Robert [written over in pencil] would get over it, & that the two brothers would hardly be both snatched away as it were at once. ++ I was at home four days, when learning that Robert [written over in pencil] had grown worse, and was in great danger, I was not easy to stay, Kilconner seemed more like a home to me, and I set off early 4th instant in the morning, & was here in good time before meeting, about 18 miles, a wet morning, no way fatigued. I went to meeting which was small & hard, little & low. I found Dr Johnson of Portarlington & John Dawson ^Davis^ of Waterford attending here - they called it a putrid fever - My dear wife understood that it was that disorder, & is fearful in such cases to a great degree, yet was quite willing that I should go +++ I am not much fearful for myself on these occasions, I go thither & sit in the sick chamber occasionally as does the distressed wife, my dear friend Mary Watson [name written in pencil on slip] ^some necessary precaution^ with all her sensibility and fine feelings Mary is supported surprisingly - Robert [written over in pencil] seemed very sensible when I came, & expressed himself in a very sensible comfortable manner, as became a dying christian: he has since been often delirious with some seemingly lucid intervals- he has this day or two ceased from his rambling though always innocent talk, & seldom speaks but to answer a question, which appears to be with some difficulty - & we are every day expecting his dissolution - he [page number] 211 seems now pretty much detached from all visible objects, he's quiet, has been greatly agitated by the hickup, but has got relief from that - partial sweats have come on - It was not ^at^ all imagined that he would have held out so long. ++
