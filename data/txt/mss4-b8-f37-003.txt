Kilduff 21 of 1 Mo [underline]1817[/underline] -
My Dear William
On sending my letter which I wrote to you
yesterday to the Post, yours came in return - in consequence
of which I write merely a few lines to acknowledge
it, and that when my Father returns at farthest
I will mention it to him, and I think he will have
no objection to it - It is so long since you wrote
this Letter, that perhaps she may do something
unpleasant, conceiving neglect on my part, but my
letter of yesterday will explain what was passing
in my mind on the subject, while yours altering
the plan, was lying in the Post office - however
as my Father will not I Believe be long away, a
few Days I hope will make no difference, and
I would feel obliged if you would in some way
let her know this, & also the cause of the delay, which
I thought originated entirely with her - If he complys
of what I have very little doubt, you shall then
either hear from, or see me, on the subject -
as to your own little matter, I hear [insertion]him[/insertion] often mention it
with

with concern, wishing you were paid, and saying I think
that you should be one of the first settled with -
He is marrying Roger to [underline]Â£10,000[/underline] - to Julia Smyth
she who was spoken of before - I suppose before another
month all will be settled, so that you I Believe
may be then seen of your Money - Perhaps, if I go
on my own Business, I may be the Messenger of yours also.
your letter is so much out of date, that I suppose
Flanagan has settled with you already, however
if the weather permits, it is likely I shall walk
over to his place in 2 or 3 days, and report to him your
wish - I was in Dublin I Believe, either at the
time, or shortly after those american friends passed
through, but did not come across them at Meeting -
Anna Taylor, I think mentioned something of
them to me, and also of her intention of going at
that time to a Meeting in Carlow, the one of which
I suppose you speak - Did not Mary Shackleton
whom I saw in Town abt this time mention her having
seen me to you - Adieu for the present with many
thanks - I remain my Dr. Wm.
Yours Sincere friend
Peter North -
whenever you write to me, direct to Tyrrels pass -
