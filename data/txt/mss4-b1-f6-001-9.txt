My Dear Master,
I joyfully reced & wou'd gladly have long since
Answer'd your very kind & paternal Epistle, if I had any other Matter
to acquaint you off, besides returning you my most hearty & unfei[insertion]g[/insertion]ned
thanks for the good advice it contains, - advice which with God's
help I shall follow, & otherwise always behave myself [insertion]so[/insertion] as never
to be a discredit to my worthy tutors, for I must flatter myself,
I have not since I left your schooll found a youth,
with a better foundation laid, whereon he might erect a fabric
from [deletion]whose[/deletion] whose top, (like the intended one of Babel) he may
reach that bright Goal of all Christians, pray excuse this
[unclear][/unclear]. I don't say I am more perfect than others, but
only that it is my fault if I do not in time excel most,
if I follow those precepts I have been taught by you.
I am [deletion][/deletion] concern'd for the Doct.s decease; some time before I
wrote to you, I wrote to him also, in the Letter I upbraided him
for his neglect of me, & told him, I thought him void of every honest
& generous principle, destitute of every human or benevolent
feeling which shou'd distinguish a Gentleman or adorn a Christian, & so on -
but I forgive him [deletion]now[/deletion] & heartily hope he is now in paradise.
I have heard from Bob in Eyrecourt he goes on well, & tells me he has
chosen the Drs. Bro. for us & has sav'd all the papers, & that our affairs
wear a promising aspect, he expects to get in the Army shortly.
Yesterday being our guard day, & I officer of the Watch at the time
of the Arrival of a Ship in the Harb..r, I took the Yawl, as is Customary,
& boarded her to know who she was & to press her hands, when I came
on aboard her, I found all but [insertion]the [/insertion]Capt. & mate were [deletion]officers[/deletion] Foreigners,
[unclear]she[/unclear] prov'd the Queen, Transport from New York, & had on board 2
officers of the 38th.. Regt.. of them I enquir'd of my Dear Brother Tom.
[unclear]&[/unclear] was rejoic'd beyond expression to find that one othem, an Ensign
by name Newman, was quite intimate with him in America.
who has given me the following Acct.. of him, that my Bro..r
came out in the Sally, with H: Rochfort, our School fellow
who was a Lieut: but now resign'd & Come home being Lunatic.
[unclear][/unclear] When Tom join'd the 27th.. he did not meet due Encouragement
