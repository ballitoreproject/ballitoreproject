America, as tho' she was amongst them: she said,
as she sat beside her fire-side, she felt as tho' encompassed
in a cloud of love, & much to her frds..
she affectionately mentioned my brother Abraham,
& sent dear love to him. We took tea at Richard
Renolds's, & after, a little retirement. 9th.. To their
