My dear Mrs. Leadbeater -
Your letters of the 17th & 19th of March
I only received yesterday afternoon
- we left Dublin the 15th March
and did not return to it till
yesterday, & on my calling in
Annjies [deletion][/deletion] I found your letters- -
I cannot express to you how
unhappy I have been made by
not being in the way to execute
yr. little commission, all I can
say is that had I been in Town
I should not have lost a moment
in procuring you the paper, and
Naas Wednesday
7th Apl. 1819
7th.. Apl. 1819

late as it was I went yesterday
to McDonnells to buy the paper,
but unfortunately the office
was lock'd & Mr. McD. gone to his
country place; had we not
taken our places in the Coach, I
wd. have waited in Town till this
day to have got the paper. I am
now therefore under the necessity
of Returning (enclosd) your pound
Note — I must be in Dublin the
first week in May, & I can assure
you that any business I can execute
for you or Wm. I shall with the
greatest pleasure — You will no
doubt be surprised at my writing

From Naas, but hearing there
was a Place in the Neighbourhood
to be let, I came down to see it,
Whether it will suit us I cannot
yet say. during our absence from
Town we visited [unclear][/unclear]avan House
[unclear][/unclear] &c but could find
nothing on the scale that wd suit
us - the land is extremely fine
and altogether a very [unclear]rich[/unclear]
country - I believe I forgot
to mention to Wm. that we got
a Servant for the House at 60
guineas per year - Abbey Knott
wanted 80£ per yr. for her [underline]House &[/underline]
Garden in Rathangan, & wd. only give
60£ per year for our house in Dublin -
we feel greatly obliged by your kind
invitation, but we are so unsettled
at present that I think we cannot avail

be going to Town not to pass without
calling to us. he will find us opposite
the Mail Coach Hotel at Mr [unclear]Hogans[/unclear] -
