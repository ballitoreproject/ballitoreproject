My dear Fathers very acceptable letter I received, the tidings of your safe arrival & finding all well was truely [sic] grateful. Jo Sparrow was so kind as to satisfy me in my enquiry respecting your journey so far as came to his knowledge, we had not indeed much discourse about the meeting, I fear our minds are not always in a temper suitable to the solemnity of religious discourse; tho perhaps if the profitable subject was more the object of our attention we should naturally have it more on our tongue, as Out of the abundance of the Heart the Mouth speaketh. I am obliged to thee for thy information about the meeting, & for the weighty instructive remarks that follow, I wish all employed in the great Work, possessed equal diffidence of themselves as my honoured Father, & then I believe their labours would tend to more profit, & their services would be more pure & acceptable. I thought yesterdays meeting was not unprofitable to me, tho pain & dryness was the situation of my mind, our friend James Keys ^in my opinion^ I thought appeared lively & spoke pertinently to the state of things, sitting down (as I thought) in a proper time, & not stretching the net till it break, if I may use the simile.
	I sent thee a letter since we parted, which I hope thou hast received, & informed thee of Molly Dudleys safe delivery of a Son, she continues in a fine way, & has some hope that she can Nurse, she has great plenty of Milk, & the Babe sucks hearty, I should be pleased that she was enabled to perform this office to it, I told her thy message about Betty Webster, but she is already provided with a young Woman to attend the Child, a Niece (I think) to her Nurse, one much used to Children, & one Molly seems much pleased with, so I believe Betty has no chance of going there, Molly seems afraid & unwilling to take charge of a friends child, thinking her situation unsuitable for it, & wanting rather to be eased of care, than ot have any addition.
	I mentioned in my last letter that I did not hear that Betty Gregory was engaged in visiting friends families in Waterford, I suppose she waits to embark. I also told thee I apologized for thy abrupt departure.
	I was concerned to hear the lamentable description of poor Robert Leckeys situation which Jo: Sparrow gave, ^sure^ his bodily strength attended with the infirmities of old age cannot bear such long abuse; I wish thy visit may prove serviceable to quiet his disordered imagination, please inform me how he received thy visit, & how thou found him: poor Jimmy is very much an object of commiseration.
	Thro ^mercy^ this leaves us in good health, Abraham continuing to have that itching eruption in his skin, I came to a conclusion to rub him with brimstone & butter, as thou objected to the girdle, & Cousin Abby thought it hurt her & Tommy, therefore altho the first was offensive in smell, I prefered [sic] it to the latter, being the old, long tried safe remedy, approved of by all, besides I do not think he has what is called an itch, but it might turn to one if not timely prevented, & in that case I did ^not^ know the property of the girdle, he is now in his dirty clothes undergoing the operation. Anne & Richard bravely, none of us taking it from Abraham.
	My Husband joins in dear love & duty to thee & Mother,
	thy affectionate daughter
