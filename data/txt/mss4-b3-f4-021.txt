Clonmel 2d month 12th 1788

My dear Uncle

	I have wanted very much this many days back, to send a little token of my love & gratitude for thy last letter of ^the^ 9th ult. but thou knowst that though the root of any good affection be alive, there is but one ^right^ season prescribed in divine oeconomy for it to manifest ^itself^ in the branches, by causing them to bud, blossom & bear fruit; & that being the spring time of divine favour when the sun of righteousness which (as J.N. says) is life to its own & a consuming fire to the adversary breaks forth upon the Lords plantation; we must wait for it in patient though ^earnest^ expectation, that as our abiding is in the allotment of pure wisdom, the winter (however long) will in time be past, the rains & tempest will subside, the time of the singing of birds come & the voice of the Turtle [?] heard in our land: then (tho we enjoy it in ^but^ a small degree) we can salute each other in spirit & word, & hail! all those who like many are bearing precious seed, let their stations in religious or civil society be what ^they may^  a salutation of this sort springs in my heart to my endeared friends at Ballitore, to the parents, who have known Him that is from the beginning & to the younger ^branches^ who have measurably been strengthened to over come the wicked one; sincerely desiring that as we have through abundant mercy been begotten again to a lively hope, though ^by^ the power of the first resurrection, we may through our various & varied exercises keep our eye single to the preserving power of divine love & to that inheritance which is incorruptible & fadeth not away reserved in heaven for those who are kept by the virtue thereof & the precious gift of faith unto the last day for herein is great joy, when outward circumstances & the awnser [sic/?] of the brethren speak trouble  Here the tribulated christian traveller finds an undefiled rest & by the light commits his spirit in pure resignation to the guiding hand of omnipotence, feeling to the consolation of his afflicted soul, that for all his omissions & commissions he has an advocate with the Father; not an high Priest that cannot be touched with a feeling of our infirmities but one tempted in like manner, and knows how to succour those that are tried  well might the Psalmist who was so largely acquainted with the dealings of infinite wisdom exclaim how 
excellent is thy loving kindness o Lord! because thereof the sons of men put their trust under the shadow of they wing 
	We are still in our tents (or rather I am in mind for my husband is gone to Limerick) one supposed cause I find by a letter from thee to Sister Margaret thou art informed of  Dear Mary seems wonderfully recruited in mind & body which furnishes her with ability to use a becoming & necessary exertion in the Setting of her house in order as far, as is in her power  If her present devotedness grows in both root & branch consistent with divine intention & the blessing of preservations ^every way^ mercifully accompanies ^us^ in the prosecution of the work apprehended to be before us, abundant will be the gratitude of obedience due on our parts, but we are only putting on our armour  its no time for rejoicing; but rather critically ^to^ investigate all our present movements & in every step we take to mind that we sow to the spirit  on our ^said^ friends first publishing her prospect of going with us my burden seemed lightened & I felt for some time a chearful [sic] serenity over my mind; but it did not last long  a care, an anxious care soon took possession & the necessity of keeping (as thou wisely exhorted) to the sure ground of the revelation of the spirit bowed me into a state of continual exercise, lest any activity of the creaturely part amongst us should be the means of setting our feet upon a sandy foundation or directing our own steps, & I find that this is all needful  my health is at present but very indifferent  a slow nervous fever ^ish complaint^ seems hanging about & though it does not quite confine me to the house, yet I [seal torn away] myself unable to go much out  however, I gratified my inclination yesterday in going to dine with bro. Samuel & sister Margaret  Were it my lot to stay altogether at home I should be apt to grow too fond of her  it is not the name of sister but the substantial feeling of it in the most extensive sense of the word, I do hope, which attaches ^us^ in our natural & spiritual affections  Bro. & sister seem to me to be both growing in their respective gifts, for their own encreasing peace & the edification of the body  they have a lovely flock  the awful messenger which lately visitted [sic] it & took one of its little lambs, has left a solemnity behind him and though I feared in the affectionate part that his late visit was but the beginning of such sorrows, yet I now hope that his power & sting is withdrawn & that spiritual treasure will be given ^them^ in lieu of that which was mortal & occupied with to the praise of the Giver & edification of the Church  I have had letters from G.D. & R.G. lately  GD is still prisoner in London & by this time I suppose Rebecca is there  they were both well  the latter told me with her good wishes that she had no view of going to France  I expect my R.G. home tomorrow her is in company with Uncle Ben. & J Davis of Waterford on a visit to the m. meeting of Limerick  I am dear Uncle with desires to be under thy fatherly care possessing the sympathy & friendship thy very affection & often tried S R Grubb
My affectionate greetings are to my dear Aunt & every branch of the family  E Pim recovers gradually has not yet been out at meeting  sister still confined with ^her^ leg Anne & this family unite in love
