Clonmel, 7: month 13:1786
My Dear Grandfather,

I received thy Letter, dated 4th of this month. The reason that I did not write to thee sooner, was my Latin & French kept me. There are many Weeds in our Garden. I am glad that you are so well, & in fine Health. My Grandmother is better. My sister Eliza is going on pretty well, in her health: we are here in general pretty well.

Please give all our dear love to all our Relations & Friends. And believe me to be thy dutiful grandson Abraham Grubb.
