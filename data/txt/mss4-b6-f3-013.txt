Lisburn August 26th 1810
If I was not very fully convinced that the
friendship of my Ballitore friends was very sincere,
I would be almost afraid that by writing so much to
you all I would tire your patience - but you are
so kind as to write to me, & I wish to acknowledge
how much I am gratified by your kindness; altho' I
am very fully convinced that my letters are a very
poor return for yours. Do not think [insertion]that[/insertion] this is [underline]affected[/underline]
humility, for indeed it is the opinion I have long
entertained of my letters - and I will not be in the
smallest degree offended if I am thought stupid; or tiresome,
or that I am an egotist; but lest I should
egotize too much I shall bid adieu to the [underline]charming [/underline]
& never failing subject of self, yet I fear I will not
write many lines until the important [underline]I[/underline] again
makes its appearance - Shall I try if the royal
word sacred to kings & [underline]reviewers[/underline] will sound better -
Well, my dear Friend, [underline]we[/underline] are very glad to hear that
the [deletion][/deletion] [insertion]Cottage[/insertion] Dialogues will soon be given to the printer.
My Father will take 50 copies, (20 of the English edition,
& 30 of the Irish.) I intend speaking to some of my acquaintances
about subscribing, but I fear I shall not
be able to succeed as well as I could wish. I once applied
North this summer, but I hope I will be able to prevail on [deletion][/deletion] [insertion]you and [/insertion]
W Leadbeater to consent to let both Elizabeth & Deborah come to see us
We would be very glad to see them & I hope they would be pleased
with their visit to us, we could at least shew them a beautiful
country between Lisburn & Belfast. Wishing you all health &
happiness at Ballitore I am your sincerely affectionate SH-
Mary & Betsy desire a great many loves to [underline]all[/underline].

to some of our acquaintances [insertion]in this neighbourhood [/insertion] to subscribe for Miss
Balfour's poems, & I got such rebuffs from them that
I would be afraid ever to speak to them again on [deletion]the [/deletion]
[insertion]a similar[/insertion] subject. After the books are printed if you wish any
to be sent to the booksellers in Belfast you may
depend on my best exertions. My Father desires me
to say that he wrote to his friend Thomas Foster about
procuring subscriptions in London, & he desired you
may request J Johnson & Co to send the prospectus as
soon as printed to T. Foster, Bromley Hall, near Bow.
I believe my Father will write to James Christy about
the Dialogues; I will let you know when I hear how
many he will subscribe for.
The booksellers have not yet paid for the Anecdotes,
but Robert will call on them this week if he goes to
Belfast. Would it be a good plan to announce in
the Magazine that the Cottage Dialogues will soon
be put to press, & that those who wish to subscribe
are requested to send their names to D Lyons the printer
of the Magazine? I am very glad that Betsy
assists you, as I know she is capable of writing so
well. How happy am I in having such a valuable,
sensible, & affectionate girl for a friend. I prize her
friendship very highly. I intend sending Female biography
to Ballitore along with some other books
when Mary Shackleton returns. - but we are in no hurry

for that time to come, but are continually wishing
that George may find the sea so pleasant that he
will not think of returning home in a hurry. I
liked Mary very much when she was in the North
two years ago, but I like her much better now, &
indeed every day I love her more. She & I intend
to send a large packet of letters to Ballitore with
the magazines - Tell my dear Deborah that I have
not forgotten that I am indebted to her for a letter,
& a poem; the latter I liked very much; if she had
not let her partiality for me lead her to speak too
favourably of me the poem would have been better,
as Betsy, Robert & William John are described as they
deserve - I like Deborah's letters very much for [unclear]they [/unclear]
are so like herself. Will you excuse me if I [unclear][/unclear]
request this little corner of the letter for
Betsy. I was disappointed about Deborah coming [unclear][/unclear]

We take it very
unkind that
Barcroft never
sends any kind
message, love,
or any little
token of his
remembrance,
but as it is
always a good
maxim to return
good for ill,
the girls all
join me in
requesting my
dear Deborah
to give our
[underline]love[/underline] to him
in the kindest
manner - If love
would startle him
pray substitute
the word respects
or compliments.
Mary Leadbeater
Ballitore
My dear Deborah, I will write to you with the magazines
but I wish to write you a few lines now to say that I
will be always gratified to hear from you, & don't be so
ceremonious as to wait for me to answer your letter,
but write whenever you have leisure & inclination & you
may be sure it will be very welcome - Give my dear
love to Elizabeth & to Margaret Shackleton &c &c &c &c adieu S H
