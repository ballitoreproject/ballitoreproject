Sir/
The arrival of a Mr. Flanagan from your little Village
whither he had gone with a young gentleman intended for
your School with an Encouragement from Mrs. Shackleton
to write to you, at present Emboldens me to do so, which
neither a want of reall respect nor of Gratitude or honestty
hath this long time prevented me from; but a conscientiousness
of my having no satisfactory apparent mode of
discharging a Debt so long so justly due & which I beg
leave both for the sake of my absent Brors. & self [insertion]to say we[/insertion] truely &
sincerely wish to have effected, which shall be instanced
as soon as Oppression hath ceased & the inexpressible delays
of Law with it's consequent unexampled, extortionary
Expences leave me an Opportunity of doing so; since I
quit Dublin (four years ago) I have been in Law
with one person untill May last; at which time I
obtained Possion of one piece of Land ([insertion]A. A. B.[/insertion] 52:2:24) denominated
Clonansen; since wch. I have been obliged to
allow
