I received my beloved sister Margaret's cordial,
comfortable, pleasant letter after my return from
monthly meeting: – no fault to [underline]cousin[/underline] Thos., who
handed it to brother W:L, on his way [underline]to[/underline] Carlow,
but he, poor man, is so full of business I suppose
he forget sending it to me immediately: – as
the said pleasant looking cousin was at MM
I suppose I cannot tell thee any thing new respecting
Anne Shannon's fresh trial, [deletion]respecting[/deletion] [insertion]as to[/insertion] her
afflicted sister's situation, & her concludion to
go to [underline]her[/underline], & leave the family visit, in which she
was about to engage, for the present: Altho' E:P
is [underline]my[/underline] long loved, & still dearly loved friend,
yet she is one of the few I should not lament
much (I think,) being gone for ever from my view,
humbly hoping unfailing, unbounded Mercy wou'd
be granted her often sorely tried, tossed spirit:
It is difficult to say wch. of us would have
stood our ground better, situated [underline]exactly[/underline] as
she was. Anne Shannon came to this Village
last 4th day evening, was at meetg. on 5th, & before
dining sat with S: Watson, A:T, & S:S, in
our little select meetg., (Wm. Neale & E: Goodbody
were her companions:) I believe she found it a

trying time, & it is probable [underline]thought[/underline] [underline]I[/underline] did wrong,
tho' she did not tell me so: Thou knows the
case, & I think I can honestly say I wish not
to perplex myself or my friends, – but really think
it is best for me not to be active any way
I can help in those meetings, after one of the
principle Elders of the QM telling me it was
the judgement of the whole, that I should be silent,
the judgment of the whole, that I should be silent,
& that my appearances of late had given
uneasiness: – [underline]thus[/underline] situated is it not rather hard
to require me to write the proceedings of our J-
meetg. & answers to the Queries? I wish to follow
the advice given me, as much as I can with
peace of mind: – a chance time indeed I think
I can feel none unless I let out a few sentences
which weightily impresses my heart, – but I
hope I never dare so to do without I really
believe it my duty. Now my precious sister
 what am I to do? – if the Elders are got
easy about me, would it not be but reasonable
to tell me so, & not keep me in this
thraldom?– – sometimes I [underline]could[/underline] interfere a little,
then the opinion of the Elders respecting me rushes
in like a flood & overpowers my feeble desires.
now why should I be griveing thee, & yet how can
I but unbosom myself a little: I do think what
little

little is to do in our Select meetg Anna may be
able for, who is, I hope deservedly, in the possession
of her friends good opinion. Ah dear Richd. Jacob!, I
had but heard of his decease a little while before thou
call'd, & tho' it was the subject of my thoughts I avoided
the sorrowful topick the little bit I had of thy, to me,
desirable society; I am tired [underline]striving[/underline] to banish my almost
continual head-ake, & am now [underline]striving[/underline] to be satisfied to
bear it patiently; – Dr. Davis applied a considerable number
of Leeches to one temple, & the cupping since – they relieved
but for a short time, – he advises me to try the Leeches at
the other temple wch. I suppose I shall after a while, but
must be excused from the Cupping again it is so very
painful. After the pangs of nature had subsided
I think it must be relieving to dear Anna Fayle,
that her poor daughter had got away from a
situation she had imprudently placed herself in. Perhaps
thou may have heard that Mary Dickinson has also
ventured to marry in a manner contrary to the wishes
of her friends: I wrote to her, enquiring if the report
was true? – she replied it was, & said she would, send
for furniture &c: wch. I have of her's in keeping. To
for furniture &c: wch I have of her's in keeping. To
our surprise poor brother Chandlee seems a little better
than some time back: I suppose thou knows that Mary
has the glove-trade now to herself, & will gratefully
take orders, wch. I expect she will execute agreeably?
we hope little Hannah White is now for life, but really
she was very ill for near two weeks: – she is able to sit
up a little now, but exceedingly reduced. By thy letter
I hope thou art enjoying satisfaction with dear Robert &
Anne,

Anne, they are just the sort whose company would be
pleasant, fine bright, intelligent, religiously disposed young
friends. I have had a very acceptable letter from my
dear unchanged friend Sarah Talbot, "Love abounds" in
her heart, she sends it to my sister "Margaret, & her husband
"& children, – I was pleased to hear that Robert Fayle was
"going to marry thy niece, for I think that he was a very
"clever young man." [underline]What every one says must be true.[/underline]
Sarah also mentions Peter Widdows being married out
of the society, which is a great trouble to his mother:
as to being any thing out of her pocket I think it
is not, at present however, for he sent her nothing
(save a trifle once) since he left her. Poor Thos. Wright
has been visiting us, – he was at meetg. here last 1st day
& said a few words to us, wch [underline]I[/underline] thought I felt more
& said a few words to us, wch. [underline]I[/underline] thought I felt more
than I frequently do; – "Seeing is believing, but feeling has
no fellow. I have just scribbled this in hopes of meetg.
some free conveyance, & am affectionately thine.
I rejoice in my precious Anne's safety, & wish the
father & mother all comfort that can be derived therefrom.
