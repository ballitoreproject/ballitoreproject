Willowbrook Monday Morning
Dear Madam
From your former very kind
concern for my literary advancement through
any prospect likely to contribute to my
advantage I by leave to call to your
attention my present situation. After a great
deal of exertion, friendless and unpatronized,
I have been able to complete a very fine
printing establishment at Londonderry, where
the prospect of success appears to be highly
flattering: but it is now a melancholy
reflection that I must give up the entire
establishment unless I put another surety for
my paper (at a loss of at least 150 Â£).
especially when Mr [unclear]orsull[/unclear] (who has two estates
in Louth and one in C Antrim) and his brother
Mr. C. [unclear]O'Null [/unclear] of Hartfield Drumcondra are
willing to save any person harmless on the
decision. May I entreat you to represent
my situation to some member of your family
[insertion]and request of them [/insertion] to come forward as my friend, which will

at once [unclear]place [/unclear]me in a sphere of independence
after a long literary strugle. Another
circumstance of a very flattering nature
depends on the publication of my paper.
which I shall explain to yourself, so that
I have many reasons to be dissatisfied with
the conduct of my uncle.
Your interference on this occasion
will be gratefully remembered by
Dear Madam
your very faithful sevt
Hugh Clarke
