13. We took another drive to day round
through Powerscourt. There were
several heavy showers to day - We
expect Papa out to night -
14th.. We did not drive to day as Papa
took the car down to Bray on his way
to town. After dinner we walked &
rode over to Ballyman. Papa and Ma
have come out, they came after tea.
I had a letter this morning from
Polly, who writes from Beechy row
where they had been invited during
the Grange meeting. I wonder when
I will be let off to pay my visit there
15th Poor Avy has not been at all well
to day, a billious attack I believe, at
least so the Doctor says - Papa went
to town, We did not go out much
to day as Lilly and I were nursing
