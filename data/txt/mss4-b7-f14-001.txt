Aughenarget 14th: 1mo - 1784
So long a time had elapsed since we corresponded,
that I had concluded my dr friend
had quite forgot me, till I received thy kind
favor, which indeed revived every spark of our
former friendship, which tho almost totally
drop'd in any litteral sense, yet my Mind
retain'd I assure thee that regard for thee
which absense nor lenght of time was not able
to afface; I don't know what my frds reason was
for droping the Correspondence, perhaps she was
not free enough to write to a married [unclear]Woman[/unclear]
well, tho this might be the reason, it is not
sufficiant tho our situation in life [insertion]differ[/insertion], I should be
sorry it wd. be a means of altering our disposision,
at least for the worse, I can't say but it may
to some sircumstances, alters cases, therefore many
things may come across to prevent good intentions
but it must be a hard case when we must
altogether deprive ourselves of our connections
and friendships in life, to be sure we may meet
with many hindrances in a maried state, that a
single woman has not, but some spear time may
readily be acquired, in case of friendship & when
one is happyly joynd, surely its only a [insertion]double[/insertion] [unclear]demand[/unclear]
to friendship. I cant accuse my dr. Molly of this.

as it is my own conjecture, but let what's past
suffice in hopes to continue an agreeable correspondence
to me once more. - thee spent I suppose
an agreeable time in the North, thy oppinion of
which wd. have been glad to have heard, was thee
at John Conrans, how is his Wife reconciled to
it: the north seems a favourite place of some of
our young Woman. I was exceeding glad to hear
your family are in health as true mercy this
leaves ours at present, tho many are at this season
ailing, which has caused a malencholy time
to many, who have been deprived of friends & relations
this is what my dr. we must all expect, either sooner
or laiter, & sorrowfully have I had a severe tryal
off & at a time when I least expected so we know
and the day, nor hour when the messenger will be
sent to our houses, nor when the most darlings
things we may be deprived off, yet I can say I have
I have been thankful, tho the finest & loveliest
flower was plucked from me, that I was comforted
in the loss, of a good child knowing he was
relaised from abundance of troubles, that might
have fallen to his lot, in this troublesome world
my hidden grief, was soothed nor was I permitted
to wish for him back, from the happyness I was
convinced he wd. enjoy. may this wished for state
of mind be ever my support. in greater tryals knowing
that the Lord is all sufficient to support us
thro anything He inflicts us with. his Will not
ours be done. ~ the rest of my Children are now
in a good state being happyly brought over the
small Pox by Innoculation. A thing no doubt thee

may wonder I admitted to that, I can tell thee I
did without much reluctance, burying the one of it in
a natural way, perhaps made me the more readily
consent; however I look upon it to be right to make
use of a means found out, I believe by the permission
of Providance, to lighten a nasty disorder
that all is subject too, & that has taken of so many
to be sure a proper time, & season ought to be attended
to -- I can give thee but a poor account of
my sister, as the last we had seems to be pretty
much as usial, a malencholy situation indeed is her
greatly to be pittyed, finding no relief from human
Aid; may that Providance that is all sufficient support
her under afflictions. poor Mary Watson I
greatly pitty her. well thee may say our society is
[unclear]effected[/unclear] on, when such scandalous things
[unclear]ng [/unclear]us, the Waterford friends wont be [unclear]acc[/unclear]
so much in some peoples eyes. -- nothing [unclear]nee[/unclear]
here our famely tolerable, sister Robinson [unclear][/unclear]
cold most of the Winter, Sister Hannah but [unclear][/unclear]
[unclear]She[/unclear] gets out, but believe you wont be[unclear] likely to a[/unclear]
any Woman from this side this Meeting gladly wd.
I have gone, but as I am a nurse must [unclear][/unclear]
that gratification, so my dr. thee friends what incumbrances
matrimony brings. -- now thee see I have
made out a long letter. hoping it may find acceptance
wt my dr.. frd.. adding my kind love to all yr.
family Thos: & my sister Joyning, and conclude
with unabaited affection thy constant Friend.
