My Dear Respected Friend.


                                Limerick..10th..8..1788


        Thy exceedingly Valued favor was cause of renewed Consolation and Instruction to my poor Mind. had much longed for a visable [sic] proof of the Continuation of thy Fatherly Regard feeling in general so weak and destitute that am freequently [sic] ready to conclude I am cut off from the Rememberence [sic] of my Dearest Friends which pinches my very heart: a desire prevails that I might be enabled to Walk more and more acceptabley [sic] the few remaining Days that may be appointed in the ordering of Best Wisdom - -
        I wish to retain a grateful ^sense^ of the very many unmerrited [sic] Marks of tender regard every way that I have experienced whilst in Ballitore .. and now am far removed from such Cordial Comforts may I not repine but be thankful in my present allottment [sic]indeed as to outward situation am far more comfortabley [sic] fixt than could have expected have good Lodgings an agreeable servant (for a common sort) and many kind Friends so that have no cause to complain. but [sic] abundant Reason to Admire the Wonderfull [sic] dealings of Merciful Providence with one very Unworthy
        the Variety of Intelligence thou wast so kind to communicate was highly grateful except that of my very Dear and Valued Friend thy Wife being so freequently [sic] poorly. wish [sic] she could possabley [sic] be more relaxed from Domestic Cares am affraid [sic] they Injure her health I wish to be respectfully and affectionately remembered to her. I sensabley [sic] feel the loss of her instructive Company. my [sic] dear Uncle and Wife have proved themselves to be nurseing [sic] sympahtizeing [sic] Friends which appears very extronary [sic] as I did not expect it. there [sic] are but few others in this place with whom I wish to be very intimate but to support an agreeable Freindship [sic] with Friends in general seems desireable [sic]. My Mind seems to [sic] weak for much company unless it ware [sic] such as could strenthen [sic] the little that Remains
        My Dear Sally Haughton is much in my thoughts am exceedingly uneasy at not hearing from Ballitore as often as usual. I dread the Worst. anxious [sic] suspense is very uncomfortable my Love very affectionately salutes that Dear Afflicted Family wish I had any thing to communicate worthy thy acceptance but thou knows what I am. and [sic] for intelligence concerning Friends in other places have no whare [sic] but Ballitore to expect any accounts from: there are few here that Corrisponds [sic] with any except about Business which seems a ^good^ deal to engross the Minds of Many .. am greatly in debt to my very Dear Friend Abraham: indeed am deeply so to all my kind Friends and so I fear shall ever remain: because I ^have^ nothing to return but Dear Love and I (hope) [sic] a grateful heart. whilst [sic] any sense of Life remains may I possess so much
        My Uncle desires to unite with me in Dear Love to all thy House hope thou wilt be so kind as to excuse the Liberty I have taken in sending this worthless scrowle: cannot but desire to hold a place in thy Rememberence [sic] a Word of Advice my Dear and Honoured Friend at any and at all times should ^esteem^ a perticular [sic] favor: for indeed I am a poor staggering Child in continual dread of falling.. and when ^one^ little step hath been taken tremble at the thought of taking another. many [sic] pains boeth [sic] of Body and Mind attends my Weak state every way. yet [sic] what an unspeakable Mercy that my ^bodily^ Health is even as well as it is  Dear Molly and Sally are freequent [sic] sweet companions of my Mind should take it very kind if they would write to me oftener: my Beloved Friend Lydia Shackleton share my ver grateful and affectionate Rememberence [sic]. could [sic] wish to hear of her Health being better Established then [sic] when I left Ballitore; Farewell Dear Friend am very Respectfully
