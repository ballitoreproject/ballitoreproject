beggars , which haunt us every
place we chance to stop, and
often run after the car
for a mile I think - they
seem quite indefatigable as long
as they have any chance of
exciting the liberality of travellers
which they seem to do most
successfully particularly with strangers
As we approached the Lakes the
view was really beautiful and
view was really beautiful, and
the evening was so fine, we saw
it to great advantage - as we
felt fatigued [insertion]after our long journey[/insertion] we girls contented
ourselves with staying at home
after tea - but the boys have gone
out . -
