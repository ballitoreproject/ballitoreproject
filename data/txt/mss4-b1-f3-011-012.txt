	then in the North of Ireland, with other Friends.
							Ballitore 20th of Secondmonth 1763.
					Last post brought us letters from Cousin Elizabeth Dale. She writes very sensibly about her situation. As you are in a Province where these mixed marriages are so frequent, I could wish you had her letters with you: they might be of some service. She writes; ‘To walk in a path of inward as well as outward affliction has long been my lot; nor have I any expectation of much alteration for the better in this life. Bereft, at times, even of the flatterer, hope, my inward situation is perfectly known to no one person. I am obliged frequently to appear serene and cheerful, when my poor heart is torn with conflicting passions. I have not a sufficient foundation in myself to support my under my daily trials, and my attention is too much taken up and engrossed with the cares of this world. I seldom get to meeting, my husband being unwilling that any business, though ever so trifling, should be neglected on that account. I have involved my poor children, too, in many perplexities. May the Lord have mercy & compassion on them, who are innocent of my transgression, and direct their feet in the right path, which I have forsaken, and turned aside from, which has cost me my peace of mind! Thou art a father of children—of daughters too. It is my sincere desire that they may be preserved from falling into the like error, and take warning from me, who have not had one hour’s solid satisfaction (I believe) since I married. I once thought not power on earth capable of drawing me so far aside: secure, and confiding in my own imaginary strength, I dared at first to dally with the temptation; and am convinced, by sad experience, that the most trifling digression from our known duty, is a very great advance to the contrary.’ Thus she writes to me.
		All our dear love to thee, presented by
			Thy dutiful and affectionate son
							R.S.
