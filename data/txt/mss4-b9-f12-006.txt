Limerick 7th June 1827
My very dear Sister
Having finished my Bank
duties for the day & dispatched my dinner I
seat myself with our dear Lydia's approbation
to tell you how affairs go on at this present
hour it being 7 o'clock in the evening. Sally
wrote to you of what happened at 4 oclock on
Tuesday morning - I would have taken that
pleasure to myself but the imperative nature
of my new duties at the Bank deprived me
of the power - Our Bank Chief Ro Hunter as
he writes himself going to Dublin tomorrow
affords me this opportunity of letting you know
for the charge of one penny how Lydia & her
baby thrive - Lydia is getting strong & is cheerful
& in good spirits & with every appearance of recovering
quickly & is only retarded by the excessive
pain she suffers while nursing - but this we expect
will be of short duration - The little lady
is to be named Hannah Jane by the consent &
desire of all parties concerned & as that important
matter is arranged - I was surprized to find our
poor Dick sitting by the bedside of his sister
when I returned to dinner this evening - He looks
gay & hearty & rosy & fat enough - I was well pleased
to see him so thoroughly recovered - I expected to

have seen some mark of Fever's gripe upon him
I hope Edward is quite stout again, our dear love
to him & say how are your little ones - Are they
braced by the sea air? Are you still at the seaside -
How is it we know so little about you?
My employment at the Bank is regular & constant
& I am well pleased with the nature of it - I am
a good deal confined but I have freedom on Sunday
I regretted on John's account that I had no leisure
on any other day - I fear he was disappointed with
his visit to Limerick - From 1/2 past 9 in the morning
until 6 or 7 in the evening I cannot call the
hours my own - You cannot expect me to
say much while my stay-at home hours are
so limited I would with pleasure give you half
an hour more but Lydia wants her tea & I am
called to be her Ganymede - This is written just
to satisfy you that we are going on well
Lydia desires her very dear love to you & my
dear sister accept that of your affecte. bro-
