to meet Uncle Thomas, I
went in to buy some
lining muslin for my
lining musline for my
barege to set it off as well
as I can for the wedding.
Uncle Thomas did not
come by the train we expected,
till the next which was
much later and did
not come in till past
nine - After we got
our purchases as G Crother's
we went to see Mrs I
Crawford who is not
at all well with tooth
ache - and swelled face.
It was pouring rain
nearly all the time.
We then returned to Mr
so we had to wait
