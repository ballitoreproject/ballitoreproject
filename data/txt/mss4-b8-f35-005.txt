Ballitore 27 of 1 month 1826 --
To Edw'd. Maguire
I want thee to call on Geo: Fearon Attly
Harcourt Street, & get my Lease from the late Abram
Shackleton to me. I want to get it renewed in order
that I may renew to Thos. Bewley who has disposed
of his Interest in the Tan-yard concerns to Wm.
Wilson - the parties in my renewal must now
be Lydia Shackleton, Elizabeth Shackleton and
Mary Shackleton the sd. Lydia Shackleton's daughters
to Wm. Leadbeater - those are the proper persons
to execute the Renewal according to the will of the
late Abram Shackleton - Geo: Fearon who is
acting for the Purchaser Wm. Wilson says the clause
of renewal in my Lease is not full enough, & my
sister Shackleton has consented to give the same
full clause of renewal , as is in her Lease to me
in my renewal now to be executed - Geo: Fearon
has a copy of the original Lease & wd. probably
let thee copy that clause, if not I could get it
copyed out of the original Lease here & send it to
thee - there is no other part of the lease can be

altered I suppose it must be done so as to please
Geo: Fearon who is acting for the Purchaser, who
must have a clear, good title made out -
Now for the assignmt. of the two Judgmts.
from P. Fitzsimons to me - Please to get the assignmt.
drawn, I hope it will not be necessary to revive the
Judgmts.. till I want to act upon them: Fitzsimons says
he has the Judgmts. & that he will give them to me -
My sister Lydia Shackleton is now pretty well her cough
almost gone -
Thy frd.
William Leadbeater
