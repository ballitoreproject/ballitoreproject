Matterson, brother of Arabella and of
the timid little girl in black, who
has arrived with him.
We set out on our walk rather

We had not proceeded far when we

after awhile Mr Matterson ran
down and joined us, so we had
their company all the way, and

the hills and the fine bracing air
was [underline]healthy[/underline] tho' rather cold - but

Mr. White the sprite has gained [underline]8 lbs.[/underline]
