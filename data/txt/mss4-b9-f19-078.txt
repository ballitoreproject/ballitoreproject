My dear Eli'a
I have been so idle this month
past that I forgot I promised to
write by to night's post to tell you
how we fared John brought us to Naas
where he made a bargain with the Landlady
that she should [underline]port[/underline] us to Dublin for
13d per mile before he let us out of the
chaise, we arrived here about 4 o'clock
Mag bore the journey very well tho' she
did not sleep much she took a little [unclear][/unclear]
the nice jelly & we took the rest [unclear]under[/unclear]
some of the other provisions, the boys
were all very glad to see us tho' they
hardly expected us to day Magt. did not
mind Richd much a watch is her greatest
delight at present. Eben came safe
on the outside seat of the Carravan
where he met a Yorkshire man who
knew something of Jo Shackleton, I write
in great haste I hope my father's leg
is not worse it had scarcely time to be

better with dear love to him my mother aunt
& MD I bid farewel, Nancy was very
glad to see us [unclear][/unclear]
