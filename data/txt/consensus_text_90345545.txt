31st.. Friday a most beautiful one -
and signs on it we took a long
walk up towards the Exhibition
farm so called from a curious cow
or cattle house built in that shape
We came round by the wood
but Ned thought the walk
rather too much -.
This being Hallow Een or as they call it
here Snap apple night - there was [deletion][/deletion] a
party and dancing - Mrs Barter pressed
us to join but I had no dress and
did not wish to leave Ned, so contentd
myself with taking a peep at them
through the glass door -. The ladies
were elegantly dressed and looked
very dashing - One of Miss Stacy's
sisters and a Miss Tivy had come
out from Lack and are very fine
looking girls - besides Miss Hanny
the governess who looked very well too -
There were many others quite unknown
to me -- The ladies were finer looking
than the gentlemen - who were very
so so as to appearance --
