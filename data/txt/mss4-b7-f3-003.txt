Dublin 13th 3 mo: 1782.
Dear Molly
I am obliged to thy Mother & thee for your ready reply
& pains taken to inform of remedies for Chilblains - My Sister
Beale had wrote me of two of her Children being bad with them - so, as
I thought thy Mother had experience & skill, I requested information that
I might forward it, which I did, & would have spared my-self the trouble
of coppying it, by sending thy whole letter, only I thought thou wrote a
little queer about stiling me thy dear Friend — If I am not [unclear]dear[/unclear] to
thee, thou ought not to use the epithet — Thou might safely call me
Friend, I think, because I wish thee exceedingly well, even as to outward
& terrestrial enjoyments; but far more I wish, that thy mind may be
raised above these to ce[deletion]l[/deletion]lestial acquisitions —Mayn't say I am enough
thy Friend in setting an example sufficiently to encourage this worthy application,
but am desirous such may step by such stumbling blocks.
I would have endeavoured, I believe, to have wrote by post last
night [insertion]to prevent your expecting us[/insertion] but having bespoke Cos: Sally Watson to inform we were not likely
to go, thought that would answer — purpose sending with this to Cousin
[unclear]C[/unclear]: Dawson, a [insertion]small[/insertion] parcel of Books from America & the Women's Quarterly
Meeting Book — Hope this may find you collected in tolerable
health — think mine own seems mending — Am confined with but little
ailment, which is a great ease to what it would be if much otherwise,
yet

yet confinement is not desirable, only as its thought to be the way, the
soonest to be enlarged — My Love, I should say, [underline]our[/underline] Love is to
your Family & our other Relations & [insertion]Friends[/insertion] dwelling & collected at Mtmelick
to the Meeting — Wishing you a comfortable & profitable season
& that the good impressions made thereby, may dwell long on
[insertion]your[/insertion] minds — Am Thy truly Affectionate Friend
I ought to let thy Mother know I have a
Burgandy-pitch plaster to my back, which seems to have no other
good effect, than the keeping it warm, have flannel over; the cough
pretty much gone, without my Cough Medicine, & the dryness of
my mouth lessened, I believe by Turkinton's prescription [insertion]& the disorder wearing off[/insertion] — that
I am amendable to direction, & possess a tolerably easy mind, thro'
favour of Providence, who can make harder things easy & bitterer
things sweet, if he see'th meet
Elizth. Pike
