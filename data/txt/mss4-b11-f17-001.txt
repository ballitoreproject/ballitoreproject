I doubt not my Dear Cousin, thou wilt be
much surprised at the Rect. of a Letter from me, upon
a subject of the greatest importance, it is upon a matter
of no less moment than Matrimony, a Matter of such
a Nature as to produce an almost entire Revolution
in the human System & yet a matter which set
about under right influence & in fear promises
[deletion]the[/deletion] most happy consequences - I have been
for upwards of a year past impressed with a strong
affection for thy Sister Debby, which has encreased
& bore with as much weight upon me, that I could not
be easy, nor thinks I was acting right if I did not
unburden myself & hoping the best, wait the event
with as much resignation as I am capa[unclear]ble[/unclear] of, yet
I was exceedingly overcome with Fears, however I
gathered as much courage, as to open my Mind &
had the good fortune to be permitted to lay the matter
before Debby, the Dear Girl has been so compassionate
to condeseend to take it into her consideration, I am
sensible she feels it to be a matter exceedingly solemn
If of the most serious nature & will treat, it accordingly
I hope she will [insertion]be[/insertion] directed aright in the disposal of it,
& very much with, this disposal in my own favour,
the acquisition of so valuable a freind, would make
me look upon myself as behind very few Mortals
in the felicity of my situation - Thou my dear
Cou[unclear]sin[/unclear]

Cousin, I have always found to be my sincere Friend &
[deletion][/deletion][insertion]am sure[/insertion] upon this occasion to find no variableness in thee,
if my proposition should be favoured with thy approbation
may I entreat thy good Office in my favour? this wd.
be a circumstance I much desire & believe if thou sees read
sufficient cause to withold, thou wilt kindly indulge me
in the exertion of, may I also request a reply? in which
thou wilt freely favour me with thy sentiments upon
this proposition - My Aunt & Abby unite in dear
Love to thee & Cosn Saml. with thy very Affectionate
