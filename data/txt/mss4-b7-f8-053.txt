Waterford 24 August 1804
My dear Mary,
Thy favour of the 12th is before me
after receipt of which I took the first opportunity
of inquiring of M Whelan respecting
James Casey [insertion] & learned [/insertion] that he came to Waterford some
time ago full of the idea of seeking his
fortune in foreign climes wishing to get a
passage for the Continent of America
against which Mick strenuously remonstrated
recommending him to stay to assist him for
a while in the management of his Boats
& if after experience of the treatment he should
meet with he continued eager to go abroad
he set before his eyes a line that would be
far preferable as appears by the example
of many in this city namely embarking

in the service of some merchant engaged in the
Fishery at Newfoundland from whence he
might be enabled, after a few months to
send some relief to his mother & where he
might, if attentive to his duties in order to
improve himself, & not lavish of his earnings
scrape together a handsome sum of money
in the course of a few years with which
if then inclined to stay at home he might
commence some kind of dealing - James took
advice staid to assist it & gives him entire
satisfaction who in his turn tells me he takes
good care of him letting him want for no
necessary in his power to procure him James
is in good health & spirits & purposes going to
see his Mother at or before Christmas.
The project for going to Newfoundland is
not quite so desirable during the War
so that probably it may be set aside
Mick gives the boy a good character & from what
he says I hope he will be a comfort to his Mother

Pray present Mick's love to his sister Mary, Tim & the
family he & his all in the enjoyment of health.
I hope that perverse head ache which made thee
lay down thy pen was soon removed & not the
forerunner of any more serious complaint.
I should be very happy to take a peep at you
all but do not see any prospect of shaking
off my trammels perhaps when least expected
I may be indulged with an interview
I was well pleased to see Sally [unclear]he[/unclear]
but did not get as much of her
company as I wished: she possesses
that amiable sameness of character
we used so much to admire - is still the old thing
Peggy Rogers is in usual health rather delicate
able to be out at times Pat has been in
Lenden for a considerable time seeking a situation
which I understand he is likely to obtain
I apprehend there has been some misunderstanding
between him & the Strangmans the merits of which I am not
acquainted with nor do I desire to pry into the affairs of others
Joined by my Becca in best wishes for you all remain thine sincerely Wm Rayner
