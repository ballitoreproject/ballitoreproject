1st Monday - Aunt Ellen -
Miss Hart and Isabel drove
in to Ballytore while I followed
on horseback -. The tea pic nic
which we were to have had this
evening had to be put off as
it was too wet - I rode round
by the Shultyes to tell them so.
then to Griesemunt to look for
John who had come [unclear]down[/unclear] from
town this morning on business
and was to dine at Moone -
Aunt E &c went to pay a visit and
were to meet us at John Doyles' -
I saw George Shackleton who
brought me [insertion]near[/insertion] to where John was
and that happened to be Eliza
Jacob's whereabouts so I ran up to
see her and Anne Barrington
who both live at the Inn -
where I never remember being
before -. I shant forget the
ride back either -
Aby Shackleton rode out to dinner,
June
