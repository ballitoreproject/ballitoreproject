Dear Cousn
I recd thine to me in Dublin
in 2nd mo. last & altho I did not reply to
it, or write thee since I hope thou
wouldst not thee guilty of disrespect:
have frequently thought of thee and thy
near Connections in Ballitore - we
have heard of Cous Sally lately by some
Frds who was lately in her company
& who expressed her wish to be remembered
in Love to us - I was favd
to retn safe to Engd altho' have
both severe weather at ye time I
left Dublin as well as rough travelling
thro' Wales - it was with
difficulty we passed thro Wales wth
four Horses to the Chaise I found my
family well who have been much
favd wth Health - Five of my Children
are at Home & Jno at Ackworth School
wch compleats my number - I have an
expectation of paying a visit at your
plase, if all is well, abt this time
twelvemonth - my Partner sets out

in the Morng & hope on his arrival in
Dublin he will put this in the Post,
to wch hope thou wilt reply on ye rest
to me, to the care of P Crawford Dublin
where he will get it - if not convenient
to write soon, address me at Leeds
wch will give me pleasure - I am
pretty certain - I wish to know how
you all are - I observe thy remark
abt Cousn S. - I perhaps shd not give
an opinion - abt the matter - for different
reasons - but I do wish that right
things may be sufferd to prosper -
tell me how you have been; & if you
enjoy peace & serenity in your place
is thy near Connections favd wth Health
& preserved from suffering in outward
matters - I have an expectation of their
being supported in regard to things of
greater moment & if it shd be our lot
to be so tried - may we be prepared
& know where to look to for support -
I spent a deal of my time when last
in Dublin at Jas' Sandwiths to satisfaction -
poor D S was there -
I do not know whether woud
learn or see any acct of Tho' Shackleton's
Wifes Sister - in London (, a fine
young Woman - losing her Life - was
set on fire - & survived a very short

time - thy Children I hope are preserved
to thee, tho' those that go in infancy no
doubt are well provided for -
Shall be glad to hear of thy Bros
Family in particular wth thy own & all
thy relations wch I wish to have an
acct of when can write & to whom I
wish affectionately
to all ye F
with Love I r
