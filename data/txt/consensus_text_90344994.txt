him with me for awhile I have
not been down stairs since
third day evening --
19- Well Ellen did come last night
and we had a chat up there together
by the fire very snug - however we
had to go down to tea & so our chat
did not last very long - she went
away soon after nine O'clock with
[unclear]Whitty[/unclear] as an escort. This morning
I got up to breakfast; and did a little
of [unclear]thy[/unclear] books- - We heard last night
of William Raynor's death so Margt went
over to Harold's cross bridge this morning
I think at least. Polly came in from
Fassaroe as I was expecting - she
intends going with Uncle Thomas
to Banbridge on seventh day morning
if nothing prevents, but as we all seem
to be complaining [unclear][/unclear] of some ailment
or other she was [unclear]most[/unclear] going to change
her mind & not go. Uncle Thomas
Henry dined here Mr Davis, Aunt E. B.
called in the morning.- I went
to bed early on account of my cough
and Margt took some rest. after tea
as she had to wait up for Papa who
was expected at half past ten -
20[underline]th[/underline].. - Seventh day - Papa did not come
home after all their waiting up -
I did not get up until after breakfast,
and so could not see Polly off
or anything, She went with Uncle
Thomas and now that she is gone
I feel quite lonely without her - I hope
the visit will be of use to her -
On coming down from the bedroom
[unclear]regions[/unclear], I found Aunt Elizabeth
Cole who came over here - Uncle Francis
George Shackleton & Mrs Gough came [unclear][/unclear]
[unclear]from[/unclear] Ballitore this morning [unclear]and[/unclear]
