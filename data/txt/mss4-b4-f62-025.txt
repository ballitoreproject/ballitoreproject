After a considerable deal of anxiety about thee (&c:)
my beloved sister, I was glad to receive thine of the 16th -
but really it was written under such apparent composure,
& a [underline]good bit[/underline] before any mention was made of your (I
hope) [underline]last[/underline] robbery, that I supposed it must have happened
since thou wrote it, till I came to thy frightful
relation; - indeed I do not like to think of it - it makes
relation; - indeed I do not like to think of it, - it makes
me shudder; - I know not what would have become of [underline]me[/underline]
had I been with thee: - had the robber overtaken you after
being disappointed what would have (probably) been the
consequence? Poor dear sister Chandlee had read it in the
news-paper, & the account added sorrow to her sorrow.
Never be uneasy at not replying to [underline]my[/underline] poor letters, I
never think [underline]thy[/underline] silence is caused by lack of affection,
but mine for thee, causes me to long to hear from you.
It is kind of thee, thro' all, to remember about speaking
to Wm. Conner, it would indeed be an act of charity
to consider this poor woman, who is in a weak condition,
yet struggling not to be [underline]wholly[/underline] dependant: -
her shoulder, that was out for several days, very weak.
Little Richard White (I believe Shackleton was not added) born
6/6 mo: 1810, - died 12/10 month following. We have W: Rayner's
little son Richd. Shackleton Rayner here, & a fine little fellow he is.

I hope thou wilt not think long in getting a reply
to thine, I am willing to finish this in Carlow, where I
am upon the point of going. Thou has before now
heard of poor Debby's & Mary's fright, sister wrote
Thos. about it, & a feeling letter has come from him
since: They now give up the thoughts of business at
present I believe: Cousin Betty Johnson in trouble, &
left without a daughter, presses Jane & Debby to winter
with her: between ourselves 'tis hard to know how
to act so as not to grieve or offend, & yet say what
seems best: - however I ventur'd to recommend Debby
to go into Saml. Jacob's family, - they would [underline]not[/underline] consent,
- sister said she must not be so far from her
father, - she is about getting a little bed put up
in their room at Abby's for Mary to sleep in, who
is now to live with her father & mother, - this I hope
will make my sister's situation more tolerable. The
poor girls are to be pittied, failing in business & robbed
when they could ill bear it: they have not slept
in the house since: - I proposed to them for 2 of them
to come with me to QM before they go to Dublin, they
consent: did thou hear of cousin John Chandlee's death?
by wch. I apprehend they get nothing.

1st day.
At the dining table, after having eat my dinner at
D: Wilson's, in company with Thos. Haughton & brother
W: L, who, with Debby & her 2 daughters, send their
love to thee: - I expect to take charge of the bundle
thou mentions for Sally, â€“ Betty bids me say she
is obliged by thy few lines, & the mention of her
brother. This seems a large meeting, the one yesterday
was to me the most comfortable I have been
at, I think, for years; - Sally Grubb minister'd to
heart comfort, but I was affraid to take
cause she remark'd, perhaps those for
whom it was [underline]not[/underline], [underline]would[/underline] - Still, my dear sister,
I could not but be cheer'd a little by it: - I long'd
to tell thee this much of poor me. - I do not think
I can write any more, my sight, meetgs. &c. seem
enough for me, so I know though wilt excuse me
Anne is here & looks very well. Wilt thou give
my dear love to cousin Sally, J, Grubb, say, I
got her [underline]very kind[/underline] letter & the inclosed.
Affectionately farewell.
