O Darley, as the western star
[deletion]Then[/deletion] Beams thro' the shades of coming night
Thy virtues thus the prisons [unclear]gloom[/unclear]
Dispels in native radiance bright
The Taste thy skilful pencil guides
and fills thy lyres harmonious swells
On those kind looks that soothing voice
The grateful heart more fondly dwells
Not yet by words or looks alone
Thy active kindness is exprest
And long be thine the sweet reward
By blessing others to be bless.
