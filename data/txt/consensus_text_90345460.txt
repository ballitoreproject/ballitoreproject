2 Friday. We went to the meeting
for worship this morning.
This day Peace was publicly celebrated
and there was a grand procession
for the occasion in which the Lord lieutenant
tenant and all the troops figured.
Neither Polly nor I cared much for
the sight so returned home. and
found Martha and Thomas Davis paying
a visit to Margt.
TH and Polly dined at Mary Edmundson's
where I was also invited but could
not well leave Margt. In the
evening they went out to De Vesci
lodge where they are to stay till
Sunday morning.
