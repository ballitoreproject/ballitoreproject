Dear Mrs. Leadbeater
I am extremely
obliged by your kind Letter and
for the Pamphlet that you have
been so good as to send us on the
interesting Subject of Ireland, this
topic now engrosses all minds,
and has occupied the Senate till
3 o'clock for 5 mornings.
I am always glad to hear good news

sentiments is quite amusing. as

reconciliation. Everything in London
is macadamizing and I hope that

roads, which will save a world of
Nois, one of the most unpleasant
circumstances in this great city -
You will soon see by the Papers that
Mr Wilberforce is retiring from [unclear]Parliament[/unclear]
he has sent a touching letter to
Mr. Smith bidding him farewell
"as the soldiers who had fought in
"the same ranks and in the same
