My dear James,


As thou desires a speedy reply to thy letter, I take up the pen to gratify thee, I believe hardly to gratify thee, for I am poor indeed- the heavens seem over me as iron - & my moisture is as it were turned into the drought of summer - But complaining is not the thing - Patiently wait, is the word - I am pleased my last letter was agreeable to thee - thine was much so to me. I am also well pleased on several accounts that this matter of thy being* shown one of the twelve (a select number) is brought forward. Though some uneasy mental sensations may [pg number] 213 attend the affair, accompanied with a kind of heaviness & sorrow yet I believe thou hardly dares to put it from thee. In the present state of our religious society, it seems necessary & expedient that thou should mingle with this part of the body - not that thou need expect any higher feast by being among the cream of the people - but, on the contrary greater degrees of suffering, in being made still more sensible that the hurt has reached the noble parts, & that the light, superficial thing is too prevalent, even among the elders of the people. To tell the truth, dear James, I have longed to have thy spirit & thy body present with us at these meetings - when in your province I have seemed not complete without thee on these occasions - I love thy society every where. And I hope & believe that thy induction into this rank will neither cause an exaltation of Self, nor a relaxation of watchful care, but contrariwise, will rather tend to excite to a humble, diligent waiting & earnest petition for preservation, & for an increase of heavenly wisdom, to qualify to fill the station according to the Great Master's will. There is indeed too little of the solid, the weighty & the substantial - too much of a dabbling & dallying about the surface, instead of descending into the lower parts of the earth. But what we see & feel disagreeable in others, let us watch against, & endeavour to avoid in ourselves. +++
Thy account of those honest women's+ labour, & of the particular satisfaction resulting from their visit to your family is agreeable intelligence. It is a reverential consideration, & wonderful beyond description, how the Almighty deals with the people, how he leaves as it were no stone unturned, no means untried, in order to effect a reformation, & to be clear of their blood. May these dear and valuable friends be helped every way to complete their service among you , & may he that alone can give increase, add his blessing!
