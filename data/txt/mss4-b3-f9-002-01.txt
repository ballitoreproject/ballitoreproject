It abated after some hours, & he is again cheerful & free from pain. But how it will issue with him is uncertain, as we dread a relapse. We have +++ His removal would undoubtedly be a great loss, but (what shall we say?) neither Moses nor Elias were to have perpetual residence with the disciples, they disappeared, the beloved Son alone remained, & Him they were commanded to hear, i.e to wait upon, to attend to, to obey. +++
