Ballitore 10/7 month 1786.

My dear Cousin Debby,

	I received thine of 3d, which though short was acceptable; for I always love to see thy scribble; & there are few of my correspondents from whose letters I extract more gratification -- This I believe I have more than told thee before, & I trust thou believes me -- I am also glad to perceive the seed of friendship sown among us, who are parents, sprouting & growing among our children -- & I hope, if they be happily preserved objects of merciful regard, & condescending notice of heaven; that some of their spirits will be cemented together in the sacred cause of Christianity, pure, unadulterated Christianity; when our heads are laid low, when our vile bodies are dissolving & crumbling into original dust, our spirits being returned to God who gave them. I heartily wish that every branch of your family, & the youth connected with it may submit, in humble docility, to the yoke of Christ, learning of him, who was meek, & lowly of heart -- not vying with others in grandeur, in nicety, in accumulated gain -- but considering the uncertainty of temporal enjoyments, pursuing them with moderation, under the limitations of true Wisdom, & seeking first (giving in their hearts a predilection to) those things, which are most worthy of the aspiration of immortal spirits -- This is what will render them honourable, & amiable in the sight of God & good men -- this is what will make their lives truly comfortable, under the sanction of divine blessing; & this is what will speak Peace in the end, when an awful retrospection to past conduct will take place, & every delight, except the approbation of a good conscience, will fade away -- I am glad my dear old friend thy father went to the yearly meeting, & I am glad he is returned in safety -- his defect in hearing (doubtless) precluded several advantages, which would otherwise have been derived to him & from him, in the course of the solemnity -- but his feeling I trust is good -- & he heard & felt as much as would let him into the general state of the society -- of the declension of which from primitive zeal & simplicity he would observe many sorrowful instances, as also of the weakness in the support of discipline, which is lamentably evident in divers places -- yet I hope his honest heart would be comforted under a sense that the Lord Almighty was graciously pleased still to own us for his people, baptizing prepared spirits by his immediate powers, & furnishing his ministers & the elders in his house with wisdom & authority to officiate acceptably before him -- I was glad that I set my son loose to the service of attending that meeting, being in hopes that it might prove of use to him in various respects -- he returned safe home 24th ultimate, came unexpectedly into the parlour, while his wife was at dinner there for the first time since her recovery from her indisposition, which held her the whole time of his absence -- two of their children had also been ill -- the Doctor attending -- but (through the kindness of Providence) they all seem finely now. Lydia went this morning to pay a visit to Molly Helton in Mountmelick -- the Doctor encouraged it -- she purposes returning to morrow - Abraham, & Betsy Pim were of the party -- Betsy has now left us, after favouring us with her agreeable company since the half-years meeting -- Molly & I meditate an excursion into Munster, to set out 12th instant & be at the Quarterly meeting of Waterford 16th -- at the Quarterly meeting at Enniscorthy 29th -- Molly will stay (I suppose) nearly the intermediate time at Ross -- afterwards ramble to Clonmel, Cork, & where not? -- I know not but I shall go to Clonmel before I return; for I want to have some of my dear Peggys company -- She has been hobbled about her youngest child (Margaret), whom she at last permitted the nurse to take to her own home with her, the nurses husband not being satisfied that his wife should be from him -- the child thrives well I hear -- & Debby gets on bravely in giving suck to her little namesake -- My wife is at present tolerably well -- Anna Taverner better & worse as usual. We all join in dear love to all your household, to William & Peggy, & thy brother James -- I am, my dear cousin,
	very affectionate thine
		Richard Shackleton

11th -- All well.
