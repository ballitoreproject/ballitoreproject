I thank you, my dear Friend, but I will not trouble Mr Leadbeater
with a Letter to Dawson Grove â€” I must write before I leave the
Country, but as Mr Dawson is in parliament it is immaterial when
& I have many Lres to send by this Post. You are all kind [unclear][/unclear]tion
I wish I could transplant you, & a few more Friends to [unclear][/unclear].
My Sovereign there, never makes War I expect.
Yrs. very Sincerely
[unclear][/unclear]
Your M.S. Book my dear Friend, is most welcome! We have read out
all our Books - It seems very long to me since I had the pleasure of
seeing you - On Monday I look'd into your Window. - In vain, & yesterday I was
equally unsuccessful in an invitation I sent to ask you to walk with me.
Louis brought back my note & said you were out - perhaps you will be
so good as to take a little stroll this Eve., if so, pray call on me when most
convenient to yourself - Believe me very Sincerely yours G[/unclear] -

Mrs. Leadbeater
