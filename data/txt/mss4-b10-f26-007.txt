My dear Mother
Here we are seated
with George Crawford - just come
in having taken a walk about
the city since our dinner & tea
(in one) and I am now a little
tired - We travelled very pleasantly
here by railroad in the [underline]second[/underline]
Class carriage by which we saved
30s/ and we were quite comfortable
by putting Thos. fur coat on the
seat for on a cushion - and we
had very respectable company
amongst the rest a son of Dean
Stannus from Lisburn - Tell
Florence we had a French
Lady & Gentleman gabbling french

just in the style of her Uncle
Thos. to her on the sofa last Sunday
evening - and besides them a real
German [insertion]from Frankfort[/insertion] and a gentleman who
had resided in Germany for 4 years
& they spoke German and besides
were very agreeable and we had
quite a lively party for they also
spoke English - altogether we had
a good deal of variety and no annoyance
whatsoever - but the second
class carriages are not like the
Kingston - they have neither
cushions nor mats and no
windows except in the doors -
we had a beautiful day tho'
there was snow lying in sheltered
placed & saw very large Icicles
hanging from the cliff along
the railroad in several places
a great deal of the country had
very much the same appearance
as our own - but as we
came more south the farming
is a deal nicer and I suppose
better - We must be up
early tomorr as Thos. has
a good deal to do about
his passport & money Bills
& we want to go to Croydon
on our way to Dover I am
tired and must go to bed
so shall with love to all
bid you farewell my
dear Mother your affec
daughter EH
