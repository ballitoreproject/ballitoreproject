Abm. Shakleton to J Garbutt
The account of Benny Wilson having departed from the simplicity of
 the new & heavenly Creation, which was stamped upon him, is sorrowful indeed,
other losses may be repaired, but oh! what can make up for the loss of
divine favour withdrawn! I have several times looked towards him with pity,
since the receipt of thy letter, & greatly fear he has erred wide from the path
of true safety, & greatly offended that power who called him with an high &
holy calling, to be an inheritor of immortality, (an incorruptible crown) with
the saints in light. Oh, tell the dear youth, for methinks he is still dear to
me, often & often to look to those footsteps he has turned his back upon; often
to prostrate himself in deep contrition before a merciful God, perhaps the
offended Being, who is indeed terrible in some of his attributes, would hear his
cry & reclaim, by the Shepherd’s crook of his love, into those green pastures,
where only there is rest & sweet composure, where the lambs lie down at noonday,
out of the reach of the devourer. Sure I am from experience that he
 is a long suffering, & a gracious God, but very terrible to the workers of iniquity,
& that he will not give his glory unto another, nor suffer it to remain
in a heart which is contaminated with sin, from the temple which
is defiled his glory passeth away, & he hath expressly said, “He that defileth
“the temple, him will God destroy.”

Concerning Benny Wilson.
