Anner Mills 11th third month 1823
My dear friend
Mary Leadbeater
it required time to gain all the judgment there
and I return the manuscripts with such
wished for, and I return the manuscript with such [unclear]entries[/unclear]
as accord with that Judgment, and I hope thou mayst [insertion]give[/insertion] the remainder
without fear to the Public; there was a united objection to retaining
the letter respecting E. B- and that relating to the [unclear] [/unclear] was deemed
more suited to a collection of manuscripts - the joint letter was such a
picture of the beloved friends warm heart, it was not easy to suppose it
therefore it passes with a few mutilations with which as well
as the omission of the [underline]full[/underline] names thy honour is relied on to
therefore it passes with a few mutilations with which as well
but the selection would be pondrous and could not be compassed in
the limited space thou lays out --
I intend to forward this little [unclear]note[/unclear] tomorrow at least to
commit it to thy [unclear]nephews[/unclear] care for thee -
Yesterday I sent a bundle for dear Rebecca Widdows directed
to thee for which I paid the carriage [unclear]& by[/unclear] account of dear
Abby's declining health and being confined to bed excited an
apprehension that the might need a change of sheets and
in haste we made up the parcel but I was sorry there
was not a chemise to send - thou dost not [unclear]wish[/unclear] her being
in want of hearing aid should that be the case thou canst
hand

round two pounds for me and when advised thereof I may reimburse
thee I wish thy nephew & niece would call on us as they
return from Limerick and if thou give me timely notice I may
give them what thou ask [unclear]very always[/unclear] for I am consoled by
thy description of the Mother & daughter, the [unclear][/unclear]
and if peace & truth are now in dear Abigails possession
she has the advantage of thousands of her fellow [unclear]creatures[/unclear]
dear Rececca will I hope be done justice to as far as her
Mother can provide for her. I heard with much satisfaction
that thy heart might be at ease on thy [unclear]Ser???'s[/unclear]
account and I expect thy Lydias tranquility reconciles
thee to the separation from me to a darling child.
I think it is the duty of Parents to submit to their
own privations when presenting favorable prospects
for their Children but as thou observed I could feel
with thee and so I did & do. I hope Debby has [unclear][/unclear]
by consulting the Physician in Dublin - dear Elizabeth
sente secretly to her Aunt Margaret it consoles me
that she loves us as she expresses I admire the
love that abounds amongst you I think such an heart
as thine can never be invaded by rancour and surely
that is in itself a very great privilege I like to hear of
you individually especially of my old staunch friend thy
dear Sister Sarah who if I understand rightly enjoys health
& spirits. I well remember the affection of thy dear sister Chaudlee
and

and Lydia Meller's juvenile days are [unclear]sudeningly [/unclear] before me
my love awaits you all.
I expected our sister Margaret would have informed you of our
[underline]honoured[/underline] accompaniment I wish we were sufficiently grateful
for the indulgent circumstances both Mother & child have
made proposes whatever hardship the searching poison, Then
Babe was small born but it thrives and the nurse is
agreeable William he is named - Eliza is about in her
family & has very little trouble nursing her [unclear]Barenft[/unclear]
our very precous sister Margaret suffers much with
cough & difficulty breathing Jane Jacob saw her lately and
considered her bilious. Mary Christy Strangmo. will I hope
be restored to us - my Grand daug [unclear][/unclear] Sarah Richardson
is better but still an involid Ruth is Stout, I hear of [unclear][/unclear]
if their Parents & the other children the reputed good
tidings you five of dear Jonathan is very soothing to we
his Uncle & cousins are I hope safe in England. I wish my
love to my Cousins Beverly we should all Commemorate the
gracious dealings of Providence in so tenderly separating our dear Cousin
Hannah Robinson from us - Many aged friends have been thus
peacefully summonsed dear Jane Jacob's Father of the [unclear][/unclear]
my cousin Sarah Watson is still in the body - I fear Anne
Stott is very ill she would be a sore loss to her daughters
My children & Grandchildren who are acquainted with
you join me in love to thee & our other dear friends - besure
present we affectionately to Abby & Becky Widdows - thy loving
Sarah Grubb
