Selby 7th month: 15: 1754

Dear Cousin
Richard Shackleton

Thine of 12 of 4th month last I received which I had answered sooner, had I not waited for this Conveyance, expecting Brother William would have been with you before this & also understanding Father & Uncle have wrote in this interval, made me take the Liberty of defering these. Thy love, Dear Cousin was acceptable to thy relations & Acquaintance here, and thy late lamentable Loss of so Dear and Valuable a Wife, has been & is affecting to us, but am pleasd to hear thou art favourd to undergo such a severe Trial & Exercise with a becoming & Christian Patience which only can support us under the various Exercises Divine Providence is pleasd to try us with & is my Sincere Desire we may all endeavour & labour to obtain.

I have great Reason to acknowledge the Kindness of Providence in being favourd with a Loving & truly valuable companion; Our child is also living & thrives well shall be pleasd to hear thy offspring are also favourd with the enjoyment of a good state of health - And I believe Sister Patience & her Husband are very agreeable to each other & live lovingly together but I see no alteration in her Shapes - They accepted your kind love & desire theirs in Return to thy self Uncle & Aunt

My Wife made Enquiry of William Slaters Daughter respecting her Father, who is but poorly & infirm but Mary is tolerable & was at the yearly meeting in London. Cousin Hinds Family was also pretty well & most of them at our last Quarterly meeting.

Sally Atkinson called here a few weeks ago who is in a pretty good State of Health & very fat, & I understand appears in meetings but I have not heard her, since thou wast here, yet hope the society may not suffer on her account.

I shall be glad, Dear Cousin, that Brother Willys visit may be agreeable to you, & doubt not (if he be careful of his conduct & will take advice) but his journey may be of Service to him, whose Welfare I much desire & with my own & wifes Dear Love to thy Self & Relations with you & to A Balfour I rest

Thy Loving Kinsman
E Carbutt
