the evening to rational conversation in a social
circle where the presence of female charms adds
zest to the enjoyment.- My principal pleasure
arises from this source & reading, for as to the
vocation of merchant to which the Fates have
called me, I look upon it as the price I
have to pay for the former.- To be sure I
had rather make money than lose it, but
farther than that, I cannot enjoy [underline]mental[/underline]
pleasure in the gain of a thousand dollars -
I regard that Man as little better than a
fool, who, after having accumulated more than
a sufficiency, is still eagerly pursuing the phantom
wealth without fixing a limitation to his
desires . . .
All my Amor Patriae was
restored by last year's visit. I would feel
wretched indeed if I had not a prospect of
again beholding my Native land, before many
years pass away. I enjoyed myself thoroughly
whilst I was at home, & now, far distant
as I am, I recal the "pleasures of memory"
when I wish to hold communion with
my Irish friends. That mysterious tie which
nature has created between us & our home &

kindred can never be dissolved, until the best
feelings of the heart are first destroyed: - it binds
with equal force the Savage & the Civilized man,
the Heathen & the Christian, & its strength is not
weakened by parallels of latitude. - Even
in the Country of equal rights & republican
self sufficiency, the man who disowns his native
land or who owns but to abuse her, is deservedly
despised - & even the privileges by common consent
granted to a Lady, will not shield [underline]her[/underline] from
reprehension, when [underline]she[/underline] sins against the supremacy
of Nature. - A letter which I received from
home lately mentions that Dr. Fisher had
just paid another visit to Ireland. - I shall
be glad to hear of his permanent settlement
some where or other - he & I scarcely renewed
our acquaintance personally last year - we
only met once or twice in London, in
Ireland we missed each other most provokingly
much to my disappointment - I am afraid
I shall lose him as a correspondent - now
that he is about to get married. - I hope
Lydia continues to like her adopted home
as well as her new relatives like her -

When thou writes to me, which I hope will
be very soon, please to give me every item
of domestic intelligence that interests your
circle, for I feel as much among you as if
I were still in Limerick - I dare say,
George S. & his wife are by this time snugly
settled in some neat house in the village -
a happy, domestic couple: - tell them I shall
be claiming a cup of tea or perhaps a [unclear][/unclear]
some time hence on the score of "auld
acquaintance" & relationship - altho' I have
not quite forgiven Hannah yet, for marrying
before some of her elder cousins - her
conduct makes me feel almost an old ba - I
cannot write the word! - Tell George I was
pleased to meet our friend [underline]Ephraim Wilson[/underline]
the other day in Philada., who enquired kindly
after his Ballitore acquaintance! - I could
hear nothing of Peter Widdows there. -
Remember me affectionately to all Ballitore
not forgetting my esteemed friends Anna & Hannah
who I hope enjoy better health than when I saw
them. - Wm Grattan is doing pretty well here
but he says his brother is too romantic for this
Country - believe me with sincere regard
Thy affecte friend Jacob Harvey
