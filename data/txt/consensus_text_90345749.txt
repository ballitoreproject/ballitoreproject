6[underline]th[/underline],, Tuesday - Charlie returned to day
I did not go out the whole day it
was so wet - Papa came in.
7 Wednesday - Another wet day
Isabel called this morning partly
about getting tickets to hear Guinness.
They could not get any and as they
were coming to a meeting at the Rotunda
we settled for them to meet here -
so at 6. P.M. Isabel and Miss Holland
made their appearance, - and about quarter after
Richard - as Charlie had procured three tickets
for [unclear]Zion[/unclear] Chapel where Guinness was to
preach - he, Miss H, and I went there, while
Isabel and Richard attended the Rotunda
meeting - Guinness spoke for a [underline]very[/underline] short
time but the little he said was excellent.
The meeting was for the Irish Home [unclear]mission[/unclear]
and many other gentlemen spoke first
so that he had very little time -
We were home before the others - When
they arrived we had tea again and a
very sociable little piece of an evening -
