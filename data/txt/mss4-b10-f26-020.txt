Vienna April 11th 1847
My dear Mother
I really think when you look at the date of this you will think Thos.
has got a machine leg which once set going will not stop at all - however we do not
I assure you intend to go farther than this but retrace our steps as fast as possible back to Dresden
and thence home - but the dreadful bother about passports make it uncertain when we can
get out of this town - we wished to start tomorrow but as this is Sunday we know not yet
whether it is possible to get the proper signatures to them & if not we will be obliged to [unclear]leasing[/unclear]
either another day or two & we are not in a pleasant hotel & it is an expensive one
into the bargain - Bessie & Mr Evans we parted with in Prague as the latter had to go back
about the modil as he was expecting the King of Saxony to go see it & was only away on
leave of absence from some of the officers of the court who are friends of Capt Libornes
We miss them very much for Bessie knows the German best and we get on very
well whilst we had her - I think Thos. is now tired of the difficulties we meet with &
will be very glad to be home again - the weather too is very severe - and here [insertion]in Prague[/insertion] worse
than we had it at all - the day we left Prague we had tremendous hail & thunder & lightning
and high wind - we left it at five oclock on Friday by Railroad and travelled all night
arriving here yesterday about one oclock - we heard such a bad account of the [unclear][/unclear]
class carriages that we took our places in the first and travelled very luxuriou[unclear]sly[/unclear]
our pockets paid for it - when we saw the second class we found they would [unclear][/unclear]
been quite comfortable enough and were sorry we had not saved our money - we were
alone until about five oclock in the morning when we got one Gentleman an elderly
man who immediately began speaking to us - & finding we were English he said he could
speak a little & that his Mother was an Irishwoman - we had a good deal of conversation
with him & he told us of the places we passed through &. &.. asked us what Hotel we were
going to and recommended us here to the Golden Lamb (and a big noisy place it is instead
of being quiet as a lamb) (We were at the "Golden Angel" in Prague and liked it better) - so we
consented to come as he said it was in a pleasant part of the town and near places we might
wish to see - he gave us his card on leaving us - "Le Comte Boneolini chamberlain to the King of Saxony"
so you see what fine company our first class trip led us into - he told Thos. he would call on him us into
today - but I am sure Thos. will be glad to escape him - tho his office of Chamberlain to the King of
Saxony [insertion]obliged[/insertion] [deletion][/deletion] him to be in Dresden his family reside here which is a much gayer & nicer
place - it is the cleanest town I ever was in but the streets are so narrow in the [underline]City[/underline] which
is contrary to the rural custom the most fashionable part and in which [deletion][/deletion] [insertion]all[/insertion] of the
good shops are - that it is almost impossible to escape being run over - such driving
about of carriages both private & public I never saw in so confined a place - the buildings
are very grand & the houses all look so clean that it is really very nice looking place

but it is not half so extraordinary or picturesque as Prague - must go back now to Prague
and tell you that we had a good deal of trouble about our Passports - there too - not Thos's but
to get one for Mary to allow her to come on without Bessie and to let Bessie go back to Dresden
with Mr. Evans - whilst we were in the office we observed a gentleman enter with his
Dragoman - but took no more notice of him than what his dress occasioned, he having
an eastern cap & cloak - we came away thinking no more about him - the following
day Bessie and Mr Evans were walking in the street and they overtook & passed him by
and Bessie remarked that he was the person we saw at the Passport office - in a minute
or so they heard some one call after them & turning round saw this said gentleman
who told them [underline]he[/underline] had seen [underline]us[/underline] the previous day & heard we were getting passports for
Vienna - that he had come from thence & if he could give us any information or be
any assistance to us he should be very happy to do - Bessie asked him to come to the
Hotel where her brother [insertion]was[/insertion] who was going to Vienna - he did so and came into our room
introducing himself as a Mr. Monteith a scotch Clergyman & Missionary to Egypt
from whence he was returning home heartily sick of travelling - he said he would
have been rejoiced to have met us in Vienna and joined our party and would then
 have come as we intend to go up the Danube to Ratisbon - & on from there any
way we can to Dresden - we wanted to persuade him to return with us, (for he wished
to go up the Danube but he could not bear the tediousness of the journey [underline]alone[/underline] &
preferred the Railway to Prague instead) but he had written home that he would be
there at a certain time & would not like to disappoint them and could not do so
we had a good deal of chat with him - and he delayed us so long that I had to close
my letters in a hurry for the post and such as to prepare hastily for our journey.
We were sorry we had missed such an agreeable travelling companion as we
thought he would have been but we could not help it - he had been from home only
since December & knew both German & French well, yet he said he met with many
difficulties and was very tired of being alone - he was complaining of the [underline]cold[/underline] &
very disagreeable journey from Trieste - yet in February in Egypt it was so hot
he could scarcely bear it - Until he came into Germany everyone was cheating
him in every way they could - he thought the Germans not [insertion]quite[/insertion] so bad for tho' they might
not scruple to charge you high for what you got they did not steal from you - He is from
the Island of Bute - The country between this and Prague is not interesting at
all (at least what we passed through in day light) until we got [deletion]in[/deletion]to Moravia &
then we began to see the Hungarian Mountains - the Carpathian Mountains as
they are called - they are a fine range but not to be compared [insertion]in[/insertion] [deletion]to the[/deletion] variety &
beauty to what we had seen in Bohemia - the country immediately along the
railway is of course flat and to a great extent on both sides - there is a good

(3)
deal of wood - as we got near Vienna we found a great deal of the low
grounds covered with water - acres of Trees surrounded by it from the inundations
of the river I forget its name until I go to the map - it is not the Danube
I find I have made a mistake and taken two sheets and written on part of both
so I had to tear them & must trouble you to make out the parts that follow each
other rightly - Mary & Thomas are gone out to see about our passports and I am
taking the opportunity of writing this as when they return and go out again
I must go with them - It is not easy to keep the things in ones mind so as
to relate them in order for one thing puts another out and for this reason
I fear my letter written so hastily as I am obliged to do them are very often
very incoherent - the part of the journey from Dresden to Prague by coach was
very pleasant the country so beautiful in parts & one had time to look at it.
the lines of the railroad are almost uniformly uninteresting and then they
do not travel fast enough by them as in England to compensate for that by whirling
you along quickly - I could not count all the stoppages we made between Prague
& this place - six minutes at every water station - then there were wood stations &
three different times we stopped 1/2 an hour in order to allow the passengers some
refreshment - but the hurry & confusion was so great and the restorations so badly
arranged and so distant in some cases that is was almost impossible to manage
it & be in time - you cannot be sure even that they will not start before the time
they say if it happens to suit them - about five oclock yesterday morning they told us we
should stop half an hour at a particular place to get breakfast - they went so slowly
that we were 1/4 of an hour after the time we ought to have been there - another train which
met there had arrived before us (I suppose at the time they were due) and had filled the room
and demolished the best of the eatables before we arrived and added to this we were
[underline]only allowed[/underline] 1/4 of an hour the remainder of our half hour being lost on the road -
and it seems if the train is not in at a particular time at Vienna there is a
fine levied and the passengers convenience and comfort were sacrificed to avert
it - When we were travelling by coach we had two rivers to cross which is
done by driving the carriage Horses & all into a boat and crossing the river [insertion]in the boat[/insertion] drive
out at the other side - the first time we crossed it was the River [unclear]Egar[/unclear] and our carriage
was the only one [insertion]but[/insertion] - there were foot passengers besides - the second time crossing the Moldau
there was a wagon & pair of horses - three carriages with each a pair of horses and an Eilwagen or
omnibus with three horses - besides numerous foot passengers - & two Harpers playing all the
time so that if we had gone down we should have been like swans have had music whilst
dying - I could not well explain how we got across but we arrived safely but with
a big jolt on Terra firma -

the altars - but at the small ones there were no priests - altho the people were praying & reading
in them - the priests were curiously dressed - over their black dresses [deletion]they[/deletion] which are long down
to their heels they wore short dresses [insertion]like white bedgowns[/insertion] with full sleeves and deep [insertion]open[/insertion] work at the bottom [insertion]of the skirt[/insertion] and over
this again a lilac colored pelerine - they had no hats but their hair closely cut & a small black skull
cap on their heads - Mary & Thos. have come in and we had breakfast and now
we are going out again - they were told we could get the Pasports signed so now
if we can get a steamer tomorrow we will set out for Lintz on our
way home - I feel when I am writing as if it brought me nearer to you to do so, but
I forget that I cannot hear of you - I can only tell you about ourselves with dearest
love to all I am my dear Mother your affection daughter EM Thos & Mary send [underline]very best[/underline] love
Thos bid me say we are finding out the advantages & disadvantages of travelling -
The Cathedral here (St Stephanes) is a very curious pile - the roof is covered with
variegated tiles done in pattern work - it is very steep and can therefore be seen
much more plainly, the wall spires & steeples covered with ornaments of one kind
or other heads status &c - it was open and we went in - there are three large [insertion]distinct[/insertion] chapels
with large and very highly ornamented Altars & altar pieces - and besides these we counted 14
smaller ones and I think at every one of them there were people kneeling - numbers
of persons came in and out from curiosity like ourselves - all were quiet and no hindrances
to any one - there were three or four doors - and people came in at one and if they chose went
out at another - We saw Priests coming in to officiate in the larger chapels - & candles were lighted on
Give my love to Isabella
I hope you have told her
about us. I have nothing
particular to say to her
and I find it hard enough
to write even as much
as I do - I hope I shall
find all well
