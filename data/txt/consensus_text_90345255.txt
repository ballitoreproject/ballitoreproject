by the three O'clock train. I went
over before dinner to see Ellen and
asked her to come and stay with me
awhile, so she came over after dinner
and we had a very pleasant evening.
She is sitting beside me while I write.
Elizabeth called this evening and
we had a pleasant little chat with her.
9th.. Ellen left us at about 10Â½ - Margt
and I followed her afterwards, as we were
going to attend an Olive leaf meeting. Ellen
came in for awhile, but does not
seem interested in it. Aunt Eliza,
Aunt Lucy, and Willie Leadbeater dined
with us. Aunt L was on her way home,
so they did not stay long at all.
After dinner Margt. and I took a walk
out to [unclear]Hill[/unclear]sbourough. Papa came in
before we left this. Willie L returned
to tea quite expecting us to accompany
him to the Mutual Leaf Improvement. However
we did not go after all, so off he went
by himself. Poor Papa has a headache
