Michl. Murry & Michl Dunn gardens in superior stile
A poor nervous widow Walsh, Jemmy Dunn reports as having
her garden in good order, also the young Trees which have
been planted there, & which are in general much neglected.
Wm Murphy the weaver having made great exertion to emerge
from the dirt in which he used to live, & having a large family
we may think of him - he never got one yet
Mick Lawler's wife, she who brought her receipt to me, never
got one, beside having her house clean, she had a gardener's
calender nailed up, which few, had though they were distributed
Edwd Lawler towards Kilrush whom we look at unawares
I think is worthy. She never got one, & encouragement

dispersed in those remote places may be useful
Mick Birmingham's house was whitened & decent, but not
equal to others - some panes are out. I might repair them
Anne McCabe recovering from the fever in her family is very
clean, but as we could not inspect, we should be reckoned
partial to give her a premium - but I may consider her in
another way.
Phebe Murphy - Betty Cullen - Esther Costello
