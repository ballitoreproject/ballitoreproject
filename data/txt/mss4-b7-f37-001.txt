abar between you, for which I am sorry for, Oh if we could injoy your
agreable company as often as we would we should be often at Ballitore
as for my Self I dare say no more about comming. but if I do come

hopes to see some of your Family at Selby if thee for one shall
be pleased, and if I cannot get the same Galloway Cousin Sammy as
one of the same now a breaking 3 Years Old & a long tale so I think
it will be smarter for thee or thy Sister, if she will favour us

agreable to her I was last week by Carlton Hall and thought of thee
Cousin Molly — but never have been in Braton Bay since, but was
a few weeks since at Braton taking up some Rape Seed and —

One of the Young Men at Braton Hall came to ask me to go and drink Tea
with him and his Brother, but did not for the Person I bought Iced
[unclear][/unclear]on had two Daughter's so I gave preferance to the Young Woman's

[unclear][/unclear]ll is over, for the Youngest of them wisper'd somthing soft to Jane
[unclear][/unclear]t thy [unclear][/unclear]ll LOVE so will [unclear][/unclear], that vexis me for while
we say nothing of LOVE to them, they are kind and as soon as we
do what an alteration it make's with them, so I think to keep kind
with young Women is never to say LOVE to them. — I am Obliged
to thee for the Complement thou gave me on the Young Women at your
House which I should have had no Objections to been with at Ballitore
