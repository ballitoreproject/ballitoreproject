1st.. November -
Saturday - We took a walk
to an old ruin not far from
this -. besides strolling about
the place. After dinner
accompanied by Mr Hamilton
we went to Stamboul the Turkish
house which belongs to Mr
Urquehart, as we heard he was
going to give a dinner, and just
went to see what was going on.
But we were too soon, and saw
nothing except a crowd of country
people collected and others thronging
towards the place -
This being weighing night we were
weighed and fun it was. Ned
was a pound and a half heavier and
as for me I [unclear]opened[/unclear] my eyes when I
was told my weight 8 stone 9½ -
They say I will grow much fatter
here every body does, but indeed I hope
not -. Miss Hanny and Miss Tivy
both exceeded 12 stone, and they were
laying small wages on them - Miss
laying small wagers on them - Miss
[extra line]
Hanny was one ½ pound heavier
