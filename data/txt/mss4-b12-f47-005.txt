Jamaca long Island Augt 31st
My Dear Redfoord
The campain [deletion]is[/deletion] opened & so far we
have succeeded beyond our most Sanguine expectations
On the 22d in the morning the army embarked
from Staten Island & immediately landed at
Graves head without firing a Shot we marched
about three or four miles into the country encampt
& lay there till the 26th during which time a
constant skirmishing was kept up between our
advanced guards & the Rebels with the loss on our
side of only 5 or 6 men & a few wounded - At eight
in the evening we began our march in three Columns
the one we w[deletion]u[/deletion][insertion]e[/insertion]re in which was composed of part of
the Light Infantry Granrs. Highlanders & some
other Regt rech'd to the Heighth of about one in
the morning where we lay on our arms till day
break, we were then about two miles from Bedfoord
where the Rebels had a very strong work
when we came withing a mile or a mile & a half
of Bedfoord the began to shew themselves along
the Skirts of the wood in great numbers
& kept up a he[insertion]a[/insertion]vy fire from that till we came
very near their work, when something like a
general engagement began which lasted half an
hour they made a retreat in the utmost disorder
it is imagined this day has cost them from two to
three

three thousand men kill'd Wounded & taken, of the
latter are 1100 among which are Genls. Sulivan &
Lord Sterling & many officers, the 2d the Light
Dragoons & 71 Regt came here, from that till late
last night we have been in constant motion intercepting
their Cattle & drivers &c.
We took the Commander in chief of their Militia
of this Island Brigadeer Genl. [unclear]Audle[/unclear] & the Major
of their Light Horse & several of his men but
without any opposition we have had but a small
share of the fighting business but what we have
done has I believe given Satisfaction & proof that
we Shall not be backward, One thing I must
tell you as 'tis certainly an extraordinary one
& as 'tis between you & I it will not be look'd on
as Vaunting, one of the light Dragoons an Irish
man going into the country on a message was attackd
by four riffle men one seized his bridle
who he shot through the head one made off &
he took the other two prisoners without being
hurt this is one instance of many of the cowardice
of these people yesterday morning at five we
were ordered to prepare to march to support Lord
Cornwalles at Newtown where it was said the
Rebels were landing 1000 men when we
came there we found the alarm false & that
instead of landing men the had the night before
abandoned all their marks on the Island in the
utmost precipetation & this morning news is come

is come from Genl. Howe that they have abandoned
new York & that we have have sent over a brigade
to take possession of it. From the present appearance
of things it would seem the war will not continue
long or by that bloody one that the affair
of Bunkers hill seem'd to prognosticate. their army
at Bedfoord was composed of their chosen men &
if we may juge from them the never will stand
again indeed what they did, did not deserve that
appelation but what can have induced them to
abandoned their numerous works is astonishing
some are apt to think they have heard of [unclear]Rurgayns[/unclear]
coming on their back in the cause if so
the war will not continue long for they certainly
will never stand before us. I had like to have
forgot to tell you there is good reason to believe
Genl. Putnam is wounded & perhaps dead in
the [unclear]woods[/unclear] but is not confirmed.
I have not yet seen the acct. of our kill'd
& wounded but believe it does not exceed one hundred
Sir Alexr. Murray of the 17th Lt. Col.
Grant of the 40th Capt. of Granrs. of the 52d
& two Artillery officers I recollect are among
the former Lt. Coll. Munkton of the 45th Shot
through the body but will do well Lt. Brown
of the 44 shot through the body & Capt. [unclear]Henerdy[/unclear]
of the same Regt. through the hand. The
Light Dragoons has not yet lost blood though
 the had been a good deal in the w[deletion][/deletion][insertion]ay[/insertion] of it a cannon
shot had like to have taken of the Lieutenant
