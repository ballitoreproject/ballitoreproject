My dear Mrs Leadbeater
Your letter of the [unclear]20th[/unclear] with 13.4 only
reached me this day: I got the paper
& left it at Mr Calverts, I hope it is

to the monks & Priests, and the
suddenness of her death has
given rise to suspicions not
by any means favourable to

melancholy one, but it may
in all probability hasten the
fate of that unfortunate Country.
I am glad to hear of Williams
intimation of coming to town, tell him
intention of coming to town, tell him
we shall expect him. I hope John Doyle
got home safe: I gave him a bill
of the Coals & the change, & also a
bill of the laths & the change-

We are quite happy at hearing you
are all well & that our friend
Elizabeth is so comfortable at Clogheen
indeed her disposition is such as
wd render her happy in any place
or situation --
Mrs. Reid will thank you when
you see Mrs Gratton to give her
best regards to her & the young
Ladies, & when you write
again let us know how they
are - I hope you will not
hesitate to let me know what
I can do for you in town, for I
assure you I shall have much
pleasure in accomplishing it. We
hope Mrs. Shackletons health improves -
Ellen begs her best Love to you Sally & the girls.
Remember me to Wm. farewell yr friend W Reid

Ballitore -
wd disgrace any country -
I suppose Sally is not returned from
Carlow, I hope she was not in the Meeting
House there, when the savage attack
was made on it lately, such conduct
