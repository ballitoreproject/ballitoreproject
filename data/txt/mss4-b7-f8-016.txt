Ballitore; 6th of 5 Mo: 1778
My dear Molly,
As I considered with myself whether
I had contented thee by the part I wrote in Sally's
letter it occurred to me that perhaps thou wert confined
to the house more than was agreeable to thee
by the weather which (if the same as we have had
here) was rather unfavourable for walking the Streets
of Dublin this thought determined me to write a letter
in spite of any obstacle thrown in my way by my s
Nell I'll say no more but strive to finish now I have
begun. I suppose Cousin Aby to have informed you of
Johnson's behaviour & [underline]his[/underline] resolution to send him home
to his Uncle ~ the Stage on second day was too full
both within & without to give him room, the following
day however some one lent him his horse to ride
'tis said he paid his addresses a young woman of
the family the same I believe that was some time
at

at Betty Malone's however it be we have got a good
riddance of him & peace is again restored. A Widdows
was like to get an addition to her lodgers, the affair has
something curious therefore shall relate it as well as I
can. A mourning coach drove to the door - enter a Widow
her little daughter & a genteel looking Man - the Widow
being placed in the Arm-chair by the Man
which he observed suited her very well declared her
business - she wished to have accommodation for herself
& daughter, maid & Coach-man for about three
months - the Coach & horses she purposed sending
home thou must know she has both Town & Country
house & yet chuses to take lodgings in a strange
place Abby seemed inclined to come to an agreement
but for the Coach-man & took time to consider of it ~
the Coach drove back to Timolin. Abby went over to
my Aunt to consult upon the matter the result
of which was - Frank Ruby was sent to Timolin
to make farther enquiry about the Woman & to
acquaint her that she could not be accomodated
Frank returned without being able to cast much light
on

on the affair he just learned that my Lady had the
Dropsy ~ it had been remarked before that she was
big about the waste - but could not unravel the
mystery of her chusing lodgings in preference
to her own houses nor her keeping the Driver
though dismissing the Coach & horses - this day
she applied to E. Boake for lodging with the
same success so she must seek some more hospitable
country - Thou hast been too happy in enjoying
so much of Eliza's company I wish
Genius would put it in S. Neale's head
here for some time but I fear very much that
we'll have only a glimpse however we must
be content. E. Widdows' eyes continue poorly she
would be willing to undergo the pain of tooth-ache
again so that her eyes might be well as she finds
that pain can be so readily removed it would
be a most melancholy thing if she could not
see Lycoris when she comes but she will not be
reduced to that miserable state I hope Adieu WR
