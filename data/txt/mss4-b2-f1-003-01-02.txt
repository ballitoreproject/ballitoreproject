My dear James,


        I received thy letter in course, and am well pleased 
+++ I think I perfectly understand thy communications respecting thyself 
Thou darest not but be faithful in far greater matters - it would be a shame if thou should flinch in trials of a lesser degree - Thou dost well to be faithful in small things it is the way to be a ruler over more - And yet these small things often appear to be of gigantick size till that Power arises which makes the mountains skip like rams, and the little hills like lambs. Be assured faithfulness is properly estimated by him, who is both Judge & Rewarder - he knows what every requisition of duty costs his servants [page number] 204 - these feel that to be exceedingly heavy, which others think a very light service & little matter - but He is "a God of Knowledge , & by him actions are weighed". I am glad thou came off in those conflicts, to thy own conscious satisfaction - as the burden is within, so the effectual help is within, and the victory within. Go on and prosper
