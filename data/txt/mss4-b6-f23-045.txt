Now laughing Spring delighted roves
Thro' Bursledon's shades of tender green,
Where Melesina graceful moves,
Of Bursledon's shades [deletion]the[/deletion] acknowledg'd Queen
[unclear]Mithe[/unclear] is gay spring tide & the while
Her choral train the lay prolong.
yet brighter Melesina's smile
Yet sweeter Melesina's song.
[deletion]Sweet, oh twas[/deletion] [insertion]But oh how[/insertion] passing sweet [deletion]the[/deletion] [insertion]that[/insertion] strain!
Tho' sadly did [deletion]those[/deletion] [insertion]the[/insertion] numbers flow,
Which told a mother's poignant pain
Which told a mother's secret wo.
And worthy she of all th[deletion]e[/deletion][insertion]o[/insertion]se tears
that beauteous floweret laid in clay,
The cherished hope of future years
Torn from parental arms away.
The lyre is mute - cloud is the strain
and shall we hear its sound no more—[insertion]?[/insertion]

To [deletion]bid[/deletion][insertion]He comes to dry his mothers[/insertion] the sufferer cease to mourn
And faith & hope & peace & joy
To the domestick hearth return
And renovated musick floats
On vernal gales that gently play
Echo, prolong the enchanting notes;
[deletion]an angel Rosalia lay[/deletion] [insertion]Rosalia! sweet Rosalia![/insertion]
Oh while [deletion]that[/deletion][insertion]these[/insertion] strains their sweetness pour
Hushed be each murmur harsh & rude
my reed be silent then—no[insertion]r[/insertion] more
On those soft symphonic intrude
Her eldest born, long absent boy
He come, to [unclear][/unclear] his mother's lear
To bid faith, hope & peace & joy
In home's dear circle re-appear
Her eldest born, from distant shore,
Returns to dry his mother's tear,
And hope and joy and song restore
To home's bright circle ever dear
