Tent Lodge Ap: 9th. 1811 -
My dear Friend
I have just heard that some of my
Neighbors are going to Ireland, & though they allow me little
time, I cannot refrain from writing you a few lines. Mine
must be a melancholy letter, if it enumerates the various sorrows
which the last seven months have produced, besides the accidents
which befell Jn: & myself, my 2d Son (in Spain) met with one, which
for two months endanger'd his life, & it is only a few days since
we knew of his safety,- - I can scarcely trust myself to tell you
of the very severe & unexpected blow I received on the 28th of Feby.
That day, I got the account of my beloved Louis death on the
[unclear]8th.[/unclear] of Decr. last, he died at Antigua of the yellow fever, on the
fourth day after he was attack'd,- - before the expiration of the
week following, I heard of the death of my most excellent friend
[unclear][/unclear] Claxton; of his generous [underline]intentions[/underline] towards my Son Bedford
being entirely defeated by an error in his Will,- which sets aside

a very handsome Annuity during the lives of two elderly Ladies,
& after their deaths the perpetuity of a considerable Estate - these
various sorrows, at a time my frame was weaken'd by my late
fracture,(which (which I think never will be recover'd) bow'd me low indeed.
I have done my best, & God has graciously supported me,- I feel no
inclination to murmur, but I earnestly wish to be laid in the
peaceful Grave beside my dear Elizabeth. The character given
of my Louis, tho' truly gratifying, mark'd more strongly the
extent of my loss!- I had trusted to his tenderly affectionate heart
for much comfort in my declining years,- it has pleased God
to order otherwise, & I consider this stroke as mercifully intended
to loosen my few remaining ties to Earth - I shall sink your
Spirits my dear Friend, by the melancholy which overcomes my
own, - I have done - I hope you will be enabled to give me a
good account of your amiable Invalid Lydia White, - whose mind,
from your account, is better fitted for Heaven, than Earth, - it is
not for the Dead, but for the Living, we should mourn - [unclear]Thomas[/unclear]
Wilkinson left me on Sunday, he kindly came over from the
Quarterly Meeting the day before - I was glad to think him quite
recover'd from the effects of his accidents. We talk'd of you, as

indeed we always do,- with affectionate interest - Two months
since I ordered my Kendal Bookseller to procure me your "Cottage
Dialogues", & he has just informed me "they are not yet publish'd"-
I thank you for the Extract from Col. Keating's letter, they are
very gratifying! he certainly did not see Elizabeth in Feb: 1801 -
She was not in London till the following year, & then for a short
time only - When you write next, tell me of Mr. Kearney's father
[unclear][/unclear] of any Profession or Business, & what? Like you, I am delighted
with "the Lady of the Lake", & on [underline]the whole[/underline] prefer it to either the Lay
or Marmion,- though certainly there are some passages in the latter
more striking, than any in the Lady of the Lake - I own Scott is a
favourite Poet of mine - All those, whose opinion I respect, as
[unclear][/unclear][unclear][/unclear] me about a new Work call'd "Self [unclear]Confront[/unclear]" - I have
yet seen it, but I am told it is as Pious as Calibs, & much more
liberal & amusing - The account you give of your Family, is
very promising, & I ardently hope your best wishes may be fulfill'd
my letter is call'd for, & I must hastily beg to be affectionately
remember'd to all my kind Friends at Ballitore, & assure you
of the Esteem & sincere Regard of
[unclear][/unclear]
Faithful Turpin sends her
best Respects, She & I have mingled
our tears of late very plentifully

Mary Leadbeater
Ballitore.
