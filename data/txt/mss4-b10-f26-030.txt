Paris Sept 10th 1854 Wagram Hotel
My dear Mother
We expected when we were
last from Basle on 6th just that we should
have been at least in London by this time
but neither Thos. nor I were well enough
to travel yesterday nor is Thos. yet - tho' I am
pretty well, - Thos. is better but in bed today
to be well enough to get on tomorrow - We
left Basle on the 6th in the 12 45 train for
Paris & had to travel all night having
stopt 3 hours at Strasbourg where we
had time to drive & see the Cathedral
& wonderful Clock - we did not get here
until 11 oclock on Thursday morning the 7
all of us very much tired more so because
we had a very crowded train & disagreeable
people - when we arrived here at our
old Hotel tho' not in our former apartment
& had washed dressed & breakfasted we
felt somewhat refreshed & went to the

Louvre but as it closes every day at 4
oclock we had not much time to stay
we afterwards walked about & visited some
of the places we knew & liked when
here before & went early to bed - the
next day - Thos. had to go about his passport
& to the post office to try for letters and
as the two places are at opposite sides
of the City it took some time - Mary staid
 within to write to Olivia, & Emy & I went
about by ourselves until Thos. returned
& then we went again to the Louvre and
saw many rooms & things only lately opened
to the public at all & it being late when we
got to the Large Gallery of paintings we had
not time to see them Thos. proposed we
not time to see them & Thos. proposed we
should stay another day for the purpose &
when we left the Louvre & had dined at a
restaurant we went to the railway station
to find out about our departure because
as we were booked from Basle to London
by 2nd Class it was necessary to be sure
what train to go by that [underline]had second class[/underline] on
it as some have only first class - We had
therefore arranged to leave [underline]this morning[/underline] having
fixed to spend Saturday in the Louvre &
it was well we had done so for I was not
well enough yesterday morning to be even
up for breakfast & during the day when
I was better & able to be out Thos. was
very poorly - we attributed both our illnesses
to [insertion]pease[/insertion] soup we had had for dinner & neither
of us having taken any for some time it
disagreed with us - we were all inclined
for early bed & none of us up early this
morning - Thos. still in bed & sleeping after
breakfast - we hope he will be well enough
to start tomorrow for Boulogne & it may be
if all are well on to London tomorrow night
but of this we are not quite sure yet -
however I hope we shall be once more
in "Old Ireland" before the end of the week
these little attacks of Thos. make me very
anxious to be at home - Paris is much

cooler than when we were here before.
this is not the fashionable time here and
we have not seen so many nice people
but still it has the same appearance
of every one being out & enjoying themselves
there is an immensity of Building going
on in this neighbourhood & many improvements
since we were here - the Exhibition Building
wh. is to be open next year is roofed but not
nearly finished yet - it will be a fine and
[underline]permanent[/underline] building not like either ours
or the London one of 1851 - it is not a Chrystal
Palace - but is I believe to be lighted by a
Glass roof & side windows -
We have not met a single person we
knew since we left home except Gabe
Fisher - wh. seems curious where such
numbers are always travelling both from
England & Ireland - We have not seen
either Emperor or Empress I believe
they are at Boulogne - This is one of
the FÃªte days at St. Cloud but as I
