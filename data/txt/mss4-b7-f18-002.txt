Selby 5th Month 7th 1812
My dear Cousin
I received thy kind letter along with
the Book thou was so good as to send us and
for which tho; late I beg thou will accept my
best thanks and be assured it will at any
time give me the greatest pleasure to hear
from thee when ever thou wilt favour me
with a few lines. I wish in thy next thou
wilt let me know in what County the
Village of Ballitore is in; for when I inquire
after thee I am at a loss in making people
understand as they all ask me in what part
of Ireland it is. In my last letter I inform'd
thee of my Son's marriage. I may now tell thee
that they have increased their family by the
birth of a Daughter she is a fine child about

17 months old my Son resides at Staynor I
have nothing to do with the Farm now I have
retired from business myself and Daughters
live at Selby my Son Samuel will be at liberty
in a few months when I hope he will meet
with a comfortable situation he intends visiting
London. Cousin Sarah Armitage has been
very ill but is much better she desires her love
her Brother John who was a Linen Draper has
burried his only Daughter two years ago he
resided at York but now lives at Selby having
given up business. Cousin Jane Hartley is a
Widow she is in good health and looks very well
she resides at York at present but frequently
moves her place of residence. Mary Procter is yet
living and in good health considering her age
she is ninety years old. I was glad to hear of
thy Brothers and Sisters welfare wish thou would
give my love to them and thy family; thy letter
found us in tolerable health which blessing tho;

the assistance of an alsufficient Providence we
still enjoy. I was pleased to hear from thyself
the worthy character which thou gives thy Husband
and of thyself and familys good health with a
sincere prayer for the continuation of that
health & subscribe myself
Thy affectionate Cousin
