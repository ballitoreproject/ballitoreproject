Hannah Pim of Youghal arrived to
day and as there are no friends here
whom she knows except ourselves
I suppose we shall be pretty much

she seems so amiable and kind.
12 Wednesday Another glorious day -
and we took a walk a fine long walk
after breakfast - Mr Hamilton accompanied
[extra line]
point a most charming view of
the Castle and Lake which I hope
to sketch some day -
I walked so much before dinner
that I staid in after it and
wrote to Papa &c and read -
Ned looks better today and as this
frosty weather does not affect him
much or indeed at all I think
a strong proof that his lungs
are not affected much -
After tea we sat quite a long
time in the dining room chatting
and listening to some interesting
and amusing conversation
us - We saw from one
