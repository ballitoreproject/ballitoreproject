Youngs Bury 4th 11th month 1788


My dear Cousin,


        I was very much gratified by thy kind letter of the 8th month past. I had heard that my dear sisters mouth had been opened, & in such a way as gave me no room to doubt of her lips being previously touched with a live coal from off the Altar, but I am indebted to thee only, for a circumstantial detail of when & where she first spoke, my sisterly affection for her, the glorious cause she has engaged in, both unite to render every particular respecting her deeply interesting to me, and to animate me to fervent desires for her safety
        I stayed about two months in Norfolk after London Yearly Meeting & then accompanied my dear Pupil to this peaceful abode where we purpose staying till the close of the year, the Gurney family have been a good deal affected by the removal of their truly valuable Mother her death was rather sudden, but attended by some circumstances which leave the impressions of consolation & comfort on the minds of her Children & Friends - she abounded with the milk of human kindness and many whose bodies & minds were measurably sustained by her, will deeply feel the deprivation of her kind assistance
        My Brother Thomas is just returned from making us a visit, he spent a little more than a month at Tottenham I believe to his, and our satisfaction, we had been nine years separated, in all that time he seems to have retained that originality which always marked his character and it is truly comfortable to us to find him so innocent, & so far as we can judge, not tried by any evil propensity, which is indeed a great favour to him & us - As the highest entertainment he could promote he brought eight of thy Marys letters to read to us, and he read them over & over again with unabated pleasure, whilst we, as it were with one voice testified how much we felt her kindness to him. My Mother thinks her general state of health not so good as usual I cannot say that there is any apparent alteration except that her spirits are more easily affected - Whilst I was at home we were treated with some of Joshua Beales company his being thy friend was sufficient to interest us, but in conversing with him I thought I discovered a liberality of sentiment & an aspiration to promote the general good of mankind, which incline me to give him credit for superior talents
        I am much obliged by thy judicious remarks respecting reading, I entirely accord with them not only in sentiment but measurably in practice and I can truly say, that I have never experienced more heart felt [sic] satisfaction since I have engaged in this employ than in observing the effect that such reading has upon the mind of my lovd Pupil she desires me to give her love to thee & is always pleased by [obscured by seal] kind remembrance of her
        By this time or at this time my Uncle & Aunt Pike are returned to their own habitation I hope much improved in health - We have had here the finest summer & Automn [sic] both in point of weather and profusion of fruit, that I ever remember. Those who are much older than I am give the same testimonyMy sincere affection awaits every branch of thy numerous family - I should be pleased to hear a better account of thy Wifes health - I understand that Sally has been benefited by bathing in the seaBelieve me - my dear cousin
        Thine very affectionately H. Pim
