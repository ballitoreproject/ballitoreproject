ansd. 8/5mo: 1817
May 1817
It is impossible better to have disposed
of the Papers than you have done, and
Mr. Smith was much pleased with the idea
of printing one in the Farmers Journal.
I therefore venture to send 2 more as I feel
assured that in your hands their destination
will be good. I send some more arithmetical
tables as I suppose the alteration is not
much that will make them useful in Ireland
It gives me very great pleasure indeed to find
that [unclear]Owen Finn[/unclear] is held competent to the manage[insertion]ment[/insertion]
of a school. I hope that it will thrive under
his hand and that he will train many in the
path of virtue and religion
We laughed very much over one of your village
Dialogues last night - the pigs eating the
cap and all poor Sims Cravats, was an
admirable scene and lesson.
I am sure that you will say everything to Anne
and Annes mother on occasion of the clandestine

marriage that ought to be said, and that you
will eventually have the blessing of the peacemaker
not upon you. I strongly advise Anne to conciliate
her mother by acknowledging that she did wrong
to many without requesting her consent, and then
I hope that the Parent will kindly receive both
Husband and wife.
I am truly glad that your Bandette proved
to harmless and your old man so stout.
Pray do you [unclear]ever[/unclear] hear of Thomas Wilkinson -
a worthy excellent man he is - all who
ever knew [insertion]him[/insertion] must be interested to know that he
is well.
Our next address is
William Smith Esqe- M P
London
as is a few days we remove
I am dear M. Leadbeater
Yours with sincere regard
Frances Smith
Believe me that I most truly sympathize
with you in the loss of your very amiable
Niece - the paper strongly resembles my
dear Sister - a young Woman with such
sentiments is long long to be lamented.
I hope that your daughter continues to recover
you do not mention her in your Last, therefore
I trust that all is going on as well as
your parental heart can wish and
that her heavenly father will see fit to
restore her to health and strength.
I took care of your letter
