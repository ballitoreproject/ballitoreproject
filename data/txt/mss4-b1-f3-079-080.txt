149			E. S. to her Husband.
				Ballitore 12th of Fifthmonth ^1780^
	*** I observe thy excellent remarks concerning the kind protection of Him, who has been with us through life, and the good cause we have to trust in his mercy, who knows our hearts; and how sensible we are of our own inability to provide for, or preserve ourselves. And I hope our dear children will reap the advantage of the tender and unremitting concern of their affectionate father. If they do not, they must certainly have more to answer for than poor, neglected children, many of whom are to be met with, even in our own society; and I wish the parents of such might consider the great trust reposed in them, lest the burden of their negligence should be insupportable at last.
						E. S.
