Dear Friend
Elizh Shackleton/ I have often had thee in my rememberance
since I have been favoured to return to my home, and thy kind &
affectionate reception of us when in your parts, and thinking
it might be acceptable to thee and friends of thy Family and in
your neighbourhood to hear of mine & my Companions welfare
hereby inform thee we were favourd to get well over to this city
and met our Families in usual health and a kind reception from
our friends, but as we might expect our Minds have been tried
with great poverty and a dispensation of want, which is without
doubt graciously permitted to teach us humility & greater dependance
on him who still Cloaths & feeds his creatures with that which
is proper for them, & though this is the case yet we have not
any occasion to rapine but sad her rejoice, I look back
with some satisfaction on my late journey into your Nation &
a hope attends my Mind that we were at least in the discharge of
our duty & measurably strengthend to be faithful, but after
all it is our duty not only to say but I realy believe any self
& be an unprofitable servant, & that if the Lord is extreme
& mark what is amiss I cannot stand before him,

And now my Dear Friend I can say that such feelings as these do
often afford my Mind in which I nearly simpathise with those
who have their proving times, and who are permitted to occupy stations
like Mordecai of waiting at the Kings gate, no exaltation of their
nearest relations or any other outward advantages can occasion them
to quit either this station, or the Mourning they have adopted untill their
King took favourably upon the Children of their people in captivity
and by his interposition prevent their destruction, now I think thou
canst make a spiritual application of this to thy own condition
as I have sometimes done, and in the Faith see that he who did
great things in that day, is able and will do them again, & this may
revive thy hope and encourage thee in thy poor times and such a
sequestered spot as Ballytore, I look with satisfaction
over a few in your Nation who I think are in an improving state
and if faithfull will be made useful and some there are of
these in divers parts and also some visited young people, & though
the occasion for Lamentation is great on account of Many who are
deeply centered in the gratifications of this life and seen deaf &
unawakened to the calls of Heaven, yet ought not this to Discovering
the faithfull in the active discharge of every duty required of them
but I think be a means to animate & quicken & Service in the

Vineyard of the and such as are found there employd will
have their reward. I expect thy Daughter Sarah is
now in Wales but have not heard either of her or her companion
since my return this principality is apoor low discouraging
spot & they must suffer there, I am sure they ought to have
our near Simpathy, Thou will please to accept
mine and my wifes love & make it acceptable to all your
Family and Friends in they freedom, in which I remain
thy affectionate friend
Tho' Rutter
