How is our dear E. P.? If I do not mistake, I had the last
word with her in this way. Assure her of my dear love. Her letters are
always particularly acceptable to me; but I would not have her be
uneasy about writing or not writing to me: may she mind well the
work before her! and that is enough for me. Her preservation and
her progress in the heavenly pilgrimage, is the object of my solicitous
desire.

**** With my dear love, tell E.P. I received
her letter. She ought, by this time, to have known me better, than to ima-
gine that I could forget her. She is like one engraven on the palms
of my hands. Indeed, I am as it were astonished, that people
should pay me such attention, and give me so many marks of their
223
affectionate regard. I wish for more and more of those humbling baptisms,
tisms, which keep us down in the Dephs, and in a sense of our
which keep us down in the Deeps, and in a sense of our
own unworthiness and insufficiency *** Cousin E.G.'s salutation
