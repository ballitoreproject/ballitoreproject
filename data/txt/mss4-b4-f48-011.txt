Ballitore 2/9 mo: 1808
I am debarrasie [insertion]for[/insertion] a little while for the children are gone out, & morning
visitors have not yet began their rounds, & I long to tell my ever dear Betsy
how acceptable her letters are to me, one which I received this morning, & one dated
from Stramne 4th M:-the one sent by thy father I have not received-if enclosed to thy
aunt Sally I suppose it will be some time ere I do, as she is on a visit at Violet-bank
whither she went about a week ago in company with neighbour Mr. Conochy as far as
Rathangan, which afforded us a good joke, especially as he went from house to house
requesting security for his good behaviour. A letter came from Lisburne yesterday for
thy aunt, I suppose from one of you. I deserve chastisement (& what greater for the offense
than to be debarred the pleasure of hearing from thee) for not replying to the above mentioned
letter, giving such a picturesque description of the abode of a friend so dear to me,
& the uncle of a friend still dearer. I think thou & Capt: Namage are the describers when
I can best understand. A proper - Did I tell thee that John G: got a letter from Agnes, her own
hand? he sent it to me. She seems dull about her mother, whose situation she says casts a
gloom over all her future prospects & every scene - she mentions [underline]her dear husband's[/underline] attention
to her mother. How mixed is our cup, & how allayed is the pleasure I should feel on seeing her
bestow that epithet on her faithful tho' once (of necessity) "wandering Willie"! The operation
is not to be - the dear woman's spirits & health rest & appetite are good, & perhaps the disease
may be kept stationary. I have been dreaming of Agnes. She said she would write soon to
me, & John has not written since her letter came. My blessings on them for a deliberate
company, except Helen & the Capt:, even John's trunk, [underline]which encloses my Shawl[/underline], partakes
of that property, & is reposing still in Dublin. They have at last sent me down, & subdued
my elastic anxiety about them by the leaden load of procrastination, [deletion]yesterday[/deletion] when
that is removed up start I again I suppose. Yesterday but brought me a letter from
Melisiner, like herself, all breathing sweetness. She continues the garden premiums &
adds another guinea for the neatest house.

I find thou art not in the raptures about Stramore which I was in at thy age, &
I believe the little simple elegance it had then would please thee more than its present
grandeur - I was prejudiced against Woodmount, because I like not houses upon hills, wch
lets one see all at once, even Agnes's contentious, but since you admire it, so will I as far
as the blunted faculties of advance life will permit. Thous is a little permit on Miles's
hill, which I think one of the prettiest, if not the prettiest spots be a house hereabouts, & which
I popped upon the other day when I went astray with ADoyle & the children looking for WM &
his "reaper train," whom we found however, & all joined in admiring, the harvest scene, may
I out say, in the secret of our hearts, adoring the God of harvests! I long to stamp about with
thee & listen to thy travel-tales. I hope thou continues thy father's journal, but perhaps
journals are not they [underline]fate[/underline]- I am sure letters are. Our farmers are down in the mouth-
journals are not thy [underline]fate[/underline] - I am sure letters are. Our farmers are down in the the Mouth -
they were cutting away & all went well, when the aspect of the Heavens charged, & rain
came down upon all their hopes. I view the shy witle upturn'd eye, & being willing to pass
as a weather wise, fortell a speedy settlement in the aerial regions. Which I wish on your
account also. I hope you will pay another visit to Peggy Pike, & also have her company
at Stramore. Dost not thou admire Wm Pike? he is a great favourite of mine. I wish he would
come to see his languishing Mother. It went to my heart the other evening to see him break
forth into tears, hanging his lip like a child, when his wife was mentioned. And yet is there
anything to regret on his account? After so innocent a life, gliding gently away, & with his
children, who "explore the wish, explain the asking eye." I was going to say, by a letter to
Betsy Barrington this morning I find you are in great fashion at Woodmount. Peggy
much taken with thee. I said much to thee about Capt: Baxter. I hope there will be here
when he returns, & not think I have said too much. I think thou would like his honest
countenance, his goodhumoured laugh, his tales of other times, & his enthusiastic admiration
of Burns, even if he did not possess, along with his careless simplicity, a superiour & well
cultivated understanding. Hast thou met with the Antidote to the Miseries of Human life?
I am delighted with it- read Marmien, if thou meet with it. for it is not a very [underline]comeatable[/underline]
book. But perhaps thou dost not read at all- but employs thy eyes otherwise. Must I accure

thee of affection. If i must, it is in this instance concerning literary matters. Going to
visit my Brees, after I had plundered them- one of them made a [underline]sortie[/underline] & stung my hand. I was
busy & neglect applying honey- so it welled & swell'd & inflamed, till it reached my elbow; &
tho it is six days ago the swelling is not quite gone. John & Mary Murray & their niece
Peggy Mandas, are come - the two former J: Thomas's guests- the later Mary & Anne's a pleasant
young woman. I have just received thy letter, which encloses a charming picture of
Woodmount- verify it thyself, for thou canot do it if thouwill-puu moi -did I attempt
it thou may next ask Capt: A: to draw a picture of it from description. I shall have no
objection to compliment it & its inmates when I can do it spontaneously. Ah, my dear
Ben, but I think I will write to hum & to dear A:Atkinson if I can, & leave them for
thee to seal. I sent thee but a few of Deborah's characters- some are rather satirical. She is
indeed a fine, little girl. Eliz: longs to thee as for a kindred soul, I should rejoice could I say
by her part of the mighty debt I owe thy Mother- Perhaps thou wilt not allow
that I mean the loan of thee. Well somehow it seems as if thou would not be
very long with us but.I may be mistaken. I wander from my subject. I was going to expationte
a little more about Ben & A:A:, & say what a blessing it is to have a mind which
soon conforms to the lot where the body is cast'. I fear they want this- perhaps have not enough
sought In it - but i fear always to throw the first stone - not knowing my own heart. I have
admired Peggy Pike in this respect, as in many others. She left Stramore I am certain wilt
regret - but som settled down so contentedly at Brookfield, that I felt much for her leaving it,
but behold her enjoyment rise still rejoice on proportion to her willingness to resign
them! - I am obliged to thee in intending to visit A: Atkinson. I believe I should not feel
my steady friendship In him so tendered & softened, did I not really look upon him as
an object of compassion - but don't tell him so. His age awakes him an unsuitable MattL
IN thee, do thou could cheer his spirits. What dost think of Mary Doyle? - The very
thing! but we could not space her, & might grow low spirited then. I suppose John Hancock
may fear Ebenezer practicing upon his daughter's heart. I wish success to the
Magazine. do bring me a specimen of Drennau's poetry. My dear love to Dn & N Davis
when thou sees them, & ack the Dr: where I can get specimen cheaper than at 8/8[unclear][/unclear]

It is a principal medicine of mine & the great expense embarrasses me. My dear cousin Dolly
Christy still flourished, I find green in old age. Dear James spreading the paternal shade
over his olive plants. I think thou & Hannah will like each other. I wish Mary was at home.
I believe thou will feel the fascination of Hannah Davis's manners & converse. My father & I have
been just proposing a junction. between Dr D & A Attansons familiar & Dr to produce
his healing at which is so well known. Hannah to cheer all wither her influence.
I have just thought that these are medicines to cure Epeleptic fits Wm Walpoles mother
Hannah Simmons had them very bad- a person at Mt. rath cured her completely
now maybe Abby Pim could know whether the art is still extant. She is thou
will soon come home we miss thee very much: my dearlove
to thee & my dear Mary- I am sorry Molly so often omitted send
my love to thee- I often gave it in charge to her- the wet
weather puts us a little out --
The above writing I believe thou knows, so no name is necessary, neither is any
assurance necessary of the continued love of the writer. I have been thinking this
evening whether it would be possible to include Dr & H: Davis to come to Ballitore. We
have no physician here & poor Frank got good practice. There is the Widow Horan's
place - the spot my father was born upon, with a good garden behind a little snag
house could be built there & we are not the worst of all neighborhoods. Do mention it
to them.
5th I believe the franks will be overloaded if I send AAtkinsons & Ben's
letters- so will send them by pat. I believe as I have wrote them. I have mentioned
to Ben the letter of Clarkson & of my mom which I desire thee to ask from him
Sylvy Rait & John Christy are here, the former writing by me - the letter latters to WZ
Entee nows I wish them gone that we may go in to up with M & Anne. They are
standing & on the go I hope. Gone!!! & I am going too so Farewell dearly ML
I send the letters to AA & Ben by post growing old!!
I was hard set to squeeze in the letters. Thou sees the inspiration came - what a pic
to make a cover of the elaborate performance!
