Lisburn February 11th 1812
My dear Friend
I delayed writing until I had sent
the remnants to Dublin, & since they were sent
I have been in an uncommonly procrastinating
disposition. I intended every day to write, but
something still occurred to prevent me from putting
my design in execution - When opportunity
to Dublin offers, please send for the parcel to
John Courtenay, Linen Hall. I have sent 32
yards of linen at 2d per yard, & nine yards of lawn
at 22d per yard - Please keep £2.5 for some of
the books sold, & give Betsy Shackleton 12s.6d for
Mary Chandlee, & £1 . 1s . 3d for Jane Chandlee.
Ward, & Sims & McIntyre have not paid me for
the books they have got, but I hope they will
pay soon.
My Father will have great pleasure in getting the
Straw splitters; please say what sort [deletion][/deletion] [insertion]he[/insertion] shall
get. As to payment for them we can settle
that at some other time. I do not know what
kind of a machine is used for making beading;
but any information respecting straw plait
could be readily procured by writing to William

Corston, Ludgate Hill, London. He is quite an
enthusiast in the cause of employing the poor
in the manufacture of straw plait - I suppose
thee has seen an article in the last Magazine
on the subject of Leghorn plait.
I would willingly undertake to sell some
of the Goose-down tippets, if I thought I could
sell them to any of my acquaintances, but we
have so much goose-down in the various forms
of tippets, muffs, bonnets & trimming for pelisses,
that I do not think I could sell any. Besides
the young ladies here are so partial to their
own work that they seldom buy the work of
others -
I have sent Barlow's Columbiad, & his Advice
to the privileged orders, which my father promised
to send to S. Haughton in the parcel with the
remnants - I have also sent a poetical description
of the Giants' causeway, which I cannot
recommend very highly as good poetry, but
I think you would like to see it - I wish the
description of the coast of Antrim would induce
some of you to visit it during the ensuing
summer - Do not let Betsy Shackleton
forget to write to me; I should be sorry to lose

the pleasure of her correspondence. please also
tell her I am very anxious to receive the
poetry she has promised to send - I will copy
it & return it safely to her -
I fear the Magazine will not be published
much longer; the sale has diminished very
much - Indeed it was not well calculated to
please the generality of readers; it had not
enough of alloy mixed with it. In fact, the
people would rather read nonsense than
sense, & the Proprietors of the Magazine
[unclear]cannot[/unclear] stoop to the level of public opinion
to make their Magazine popular.
I am limited for time, & I must only add,
that I am, with dear love to Betsy Shackleton,
Eliz. & Deborah, most affectionately S Hancock
I had [insertion]written[/insertion] my letter this morning in a hurry to send
by this morning's post, but had not finished it in
time - & my father happening to look over my
letters was quite surprized at my method of
stating accounts, & gave me directions for stating it
in proper order; he is now gone to bed & I fear I
will not state my account right but I shall try,
but any information respecting straw plait
could be readily procured by writing to William

The balance of 1s.9d belongs to whoever buys the
remnants - Now I hope I have stated my account
in proper order - I am sure I have reason to apologize
for my many blunders & inaccuracies.
