In pain in [insertion]wea[/insertion] sickness still more dear
Flow'd round his couch the pious tear
From [unclear]brows[/unclear] like his own sincere
sad watching of his ebbing life
Oh The dearly loved the tender wife
There combats vainly with that grief
That seeks from Heaven alone relief
Tis come - how swiftly did they glide
The fortieth year since by his side
She stood, a young & lovely bride
The pledges of that union sweet
Beside the bed of sickness meet
While grief & love & reverence blend
They mourn the father & the friend
Ah who that generous heart could know
Nor feel its warm & kindly glow,
Gone to the mansions of the blest
Gone where weary spirits rest
Gone where his angel daughters fled
While life bloomed joyous round
each head
Oh let us wipe these selfish tears away
and check these fond regrets which would
delay
The ransom'd spirit in the house of clay
12 mo: 1814
But now 'tis cold, the trial oer
That generous bosom beats no more
Sweet is the gate wch. [unclear][/unclear] blows
Thro' Vallombrosias shade
Yet here no comfort, no repose
My tortures have allay'd
My bosom once all light & gay
Throbb'd high with youthful pride
Calm was the night serene the day
My brother at my side
O Hugo, brother of my Soul
Most dear wert thou to me
My frantick thoughts where they roll
returning for on
For ever turn to thee
Pleasant our childhood's golden [insertion]hours[/insertion]
Pleasant our youthful day
Bright sparkling as the vernal [unclear][/unclear]
Beneath the sunny ray

Thou lonely Bower; no longer gay
Since she who graced thee is away
ye flowers who fondly linger here
and smile upon the fading year
As if for her return ye staid
Alas before your friend draws nigh
Full low your beauteous heads shall lie
Thou favoured Bower needst not repine
Increasing charms shall yet be thine
And spite of Winters gloomy brow
Thy painted seat thy twisted bough
Even now Elizabeth would greet
With smiles of approbation sweet
Fair was thy lot thou favour'd Bower
I was thine to the festal hour
Twas when the voice of Peace restor'd
The Captive sheath'd the bloody sword
Cheer'd the sick heart, & dry'd the tear
joyous band assembled here
High on thy portal bloomd the [insertion]wreath [/insertion]
Enrich'd by Flora's fragrant heath
Twas Virgin hands the garland form'd
The patriot glow their bosoms warmed
From this lov'd haunt so far to stray
With weeping haste her way she sped
To tend upon the dying bed
where [unclear][/unclear] to his fate, reclin'd
Her frd belov'd her uncle kind
