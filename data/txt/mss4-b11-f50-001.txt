[Mary Watson]
Often, very often since we parted has my
mind expanded in the tenderest affection towards thee my
beloved Molly, & all the affectionate feelings of a mind
solicitous for thy happiness, from the united ties of nature
& divine love have been strong with me; thou hast been
the daily companion of my mind; often have I wish'd to write
to thee, as often hitherto been prevented by many intervening
avocations, & indeed an incapacity of expressing what I feel,
& what I want to say; My experience has taught me to believe
the higher sensations of the mind flow from the tongue or
pen with ease, but there is known to a delicate mind certain
seasons when all the powers of language are baffled, & the
most copious expressions very imperfect; for thee my beloved
relative this is very much the state of my mind. Servant
beyond the force of [underline]mere[/underline] nature are my desires for thy happiness
in the most entensive sense of the word, & a hope
accompanies my wish that it may be granted thee. Let the
language of the experience of thy Progenitors powerfully
prevail: let the language of truth in thy own mind, in
the cool of the day confirm it, that Religion & happiness
are synonymous terms: In the name of the God of Heaven
& Earth set up thy banners now in thine entrance on the
public walk of life, seek carefully the durable Riches of

Righteousness; the blessings of that Hand that makes truly
rich, & builds up families on the solid foundation of unshaken
[unclear]Teach[/unclear], santifies every dispensation whether joyous or painful
for, great is the necessity of having our prosperity sanctified,
lest we grow full & forget the giver, & prostitute his favours
to purposes repugnant to his designs & our essential good;
happy the Cabbin of sorrow & penury in comparison of the
Palace of unsanctified affluence. Thy mind happily established
on this foundation, in the pursuit of the divine
blessing, will not be unmindful of thy duty as an Individual,
nor insensible of the obligations to fill it up before God
& his Church. Oh! that now in the bloom of thy youth, &
having the lengthening prospect of all the World calls good
before thee, thy mind may be turned to his service, who hath
called thee with an high & holy calling: that by a religious
dedication of thyself & all faculties, thou may be made an instrument
of good to others in the days wherein the Gates of Zion
do mourn. — Thy beloved companion, thy bosom friend, in
an inexpressible dear relation claims thy help, thy sympathy
& assistance in the most interesting concern; prudent economy
& the domestic offices are to be fill'd up with propriety; that
thou may fill up the valuable relations, & be adorned with
qualities so beautifully described Proverbs 31 Chapr. 10th Verse,
& to the end, & above all to promote this truest interest, for which
I believe he is at times properly anxious, to go hand in hand
up to the House of the Lord, to the mountain of the House
of the God of Jacob — Associate with such amongst you who
may strengthen thee in the best things; be diligent in the attendance
of meetings of worship & Dicipline, [unclear]make[/unclear] a point of

attending week day meetings; evidence to others my dear Child
the precepts I have wish'd to instill into thy tender mind
have not been disbelieved, nor any conscious solicitude for thee
an unavailing care. Cherish the affection of thy dear Companion
with a delicate solicitude, give him no pain in things seemingly
trivial; anticipate his desires with alacrity; this will
secure mutual returns, & establish reciprocal happiness.
esteem is look'd upon as a cool word in comparison of many
others as relative to conjugal felicity; but if it seems not
sufficiently ardent, it is the permanent basis of union,
when the short lived fever of the passions has subsided,
& cool judgment opened its discerning eye. Affection, deliberate
steady affection has then selected that which is estimable,
as its treasure, & laid a deep foundation to build upon, that
has stood the shock of future tryals, & supported in the
various perturbations of life, & blessed in every allotment;
but where an [unclear]enterier[/unclear] has been the chief good, & this not
supported with real estimable qualities, short lived have the
comfort of such been, for no mind can long love the object the
judgment cannot esteem. I immagine not dear Molly that
I write this from any jealousy of its being necessary, for thy
guard, I only revive sentiments thou often entertains, &
indulge myself with familiar conversation with one I love
as a Father loves his Child.— I am my dear Molly with
the assurances of best affection, thy Uncle truly solicitous for
thy Welfare
