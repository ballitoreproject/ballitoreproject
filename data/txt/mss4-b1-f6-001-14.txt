It was our Ship that took ye [unclear]Ballas[/unclear] french frigate of 32 Guns.
in Consequence of ye Adml. orders. the Prisoners are silent about their
national strength. a short time will determine all unless
the perfidious Dogs Dodge us & skulk in their Habours, which
we are all afraid off. on our return the India Squadron is to
sail. ye Capt: Lloyd (formerly our Second Lieut.) of ye Vulcan
fireship is to be Ad: Shuldams, Capt: he is my good friend
& in his Visits here frequently asks am I ready. I believe
I shall be sent to the Vulcan this Cruise as she wants
Midm. however I am positively to go if not prevented by
want of [insertion]a[/insertion] supply which I have implor'd ye [unclear]Ald.[/unclear] to grant me.
I have beg'd him to write to Capt: Jervis to supply me on his
acct. & he will have me fitted out. I beseech you will write
to him & forward me in this affair which will certainly
raise me above want. & there is enough afterwards of my
little patrimony to pay all. arguments are in vain. I am
devoted to ye service. & am determin'd to persevere in my exertions
for preferment. . by my station I have many times extensive authority
over hundreds of men. & before God I assure I have never
ill us'd my power nor oppress'd an inferior; so from my heart in
the presence of my maker can say I act not from idle ambition
& juvenile pride, but [deletion]from[/deletion] on honest & upright principles
becoming a Military Youth & not unbecoming a Christian.
it's too true, of Religion I think little. but I acknowledge a Savior
& adore a God. I practice morality as far as possibly I can. I do unto
all men as I wou'd be done unto, I [unclear]wrong[/unclear] no man. I injure no
