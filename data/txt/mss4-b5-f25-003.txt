Leeds 7.mo 8th
Dear Cousn
I recd thine wth yr Manuscript
inclos'd for W Maude & most of wch I
copied & then forwardes them as directed
Like wind thy second Lett' last Mo. thro'
ye hands of thy Bror. who at ye same time
favd me both an agreeable Lett from him
wch I acknowledge ye rest of, inclosed
in this, wch thou wilt please to deliver
I have not ask'd him to hand me a few
lines, thinking it wou'd be unreasonable
unless it was in my power to return
him any thing of ye same kind in exchange -
tho' believe he thinks, that
if it be only a Cup of cold Water, [unclear]lened[/unclear]
reasonably, it is enough, therefore
may intimate to him that it woud be
very acceptable to me to find myself
remember'd by him & when he finds
freedom a few lines wou'd give me
some pleasure - thou wou'd perhaps
take ye trouble of forwarding 'em to me
perhaps by Pim Neving, who I expect
will be the bearer of [unclear]them[/unclear] - I am not
so well to day as sometimes, & [unclear][/unclear]
find up stairs found a little inclination

to drop thee a Line - Was pleas'd much
wth thy Bror company, had I been timely
appriz'd of his visit, should have endeavord
to have gone up to London with him
We have three sweet Children, my little Boy
who is out at Nurse has begun to be
ill in ye Measles, hope we shall be favor
with his recovery - Frds in Leeds are
as well as usual, is it likely we
shall see thy Sister in Yorkshire
another year, we wish to become
acquainted wth ye rest of your family
wch I hope may be more ye case
in time - - I spent part of a day
wth Sarah Dillwynn at Underliff, she
is an agreeable Woman, but is not
her Husband as much so, he lodgd
above three Weeks at our House when
in Leeds - Coud have liked to have had
some of SD. company at York last
Week, but it did not fall out so
S. Webster has been discarded in an
offer to a very valuable [unclear]Ser[/unclear]daughter
in this neighborhood, wish poor Lad
he had good Wife, think it woud
prove of service to him - It being
dark must conclude wth our Love
to Self Fathr &c &c thine
Se Carbut
