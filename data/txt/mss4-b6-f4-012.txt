into the business, & some of them have not hesitated to
declare, that if the restriction be carried, a disunion
will take place among the States. The Enemies of
Slavery have used great activity, & in the House of Representatives
it is supposed they will have a Majority
of 8 to 10 votes. - In the Senate, shameful to tell, the majority
is 2 in favor of Slavery. - Should the Migration
unfortunately be permitted into that fertile region, we
cannot but foresee an increase of this National curse.
With all their professions of Republicanism,
The Southern planters, are confirmed Aristocrats
& in their actions are governed by the most
selfish, interested motives. - Hast thou ever
seen Moore's Epistles from America? I read that one, in
which he exclaims against Slavery, with just indignation -
beginning "Oh Freedom, Freedom. how I hate thy Cant!" &c
It is time for me to close this irregular
epistle. I have written it at intervals, & without any
arrangement,& and did I not rely upon thy kindess in
overlooking omissions & mistakes, I should be unwilling
to let it cross the Atlantic, - Whenever thy more important
avocations will allow thee to fill a sheet
in return, it will be sure of [unclear]receiving[/unclear] a warm reception
I request to be remembered to all my old acquaintances -
particularly thy family, Jas White & wife, A Taverner
& H Haughton, Mill family, Betsey Barrington - not forgetting
my affectionate Nurse Dolly. - I recognised the lively spirits
of E. Shackleton, in the free use she made of thy pen - I hope
she may never experience any diminution of them -
I have heard nothing respecting Peter Widdows lately
remember me to his Mother & sisters. - I understand Thomas
O'Brien has settled in Ohio. - With sentiments of sincere regard
[unclear]I[/unclear] subscribe myself thy affectionate friend Jacob Harvey
W. Grattan does pretty well
