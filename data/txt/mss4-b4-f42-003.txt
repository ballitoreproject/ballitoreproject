My dear Mother,
letter, my poor scribble did not merit so early, or
so full a reply, I reced an acceptable letter from
my Brother a little before I reced thine, I was glad
to find he had a gleam of hope that he would at
last be gratified with obtaining the object of his
love. I am glad not only on his account, but
also on yours, who want to enjoy a little repose
in the evening of life, my dear Aunt's belief
is remarkable, perhaps this disposition of events
is all in infinite Wisdom, I thought of it
the day I heard of her removal, it is admirable
to consider (& surely cause of humble gratitude)
how the hand of kind Providence has
been in our family, is not, "His mercy on them
"that fear him from generation to generation"?
Oh that it may continue, & none of us forfeit
his gracious intention! for what avails all
that we could promise to ourselves, or the great
imaginations we could form without his blessing
I am very much obliged by thy kind
is

it is said "He scattered [insertion]the[/insertion] proud in the imagination
of their hearts": it is no wonder the
remembrance of my dear Aunt should often
present itself to thy mind, it often does to mine
accompanied with emotions of concern & gratitude,
as she was to me as a Parent, I am comforted
when I reflect on your joyful hope that
she has obtained a release from all sorrow & pain.
she was (I think) a sincere hearted, upright
Woman, her actions being influenced by an honest
intention, her bodily infirmities sometimes
I believe indisposed her mind, but our kind Creator
sees the heart, see its infirmaties & is "No hard
Master." I write uncommon to my dear Mother,
this [insertion]is[/insertion] a state I seldom converse in, or a subject
I seldom make so free with, it so freely occurs
that I do no suppress it. Dear Samuel Savold's
company no doubt would be particularly
pleasing to thee, the remembrance of his formerly
being instrumental in administring help in
time of distress must render him dear, besides
his [deletion]his[/deletion] living ministry: we expect him in this
town

town this night & at our meeting tomorrow.
I am much obliged by thy thinking so much about
me, the smoky chimney is a grievance in
our house, & we are much perplexed with a
bad little grate & no [unclear]crane[/unclear], we can scarcely boil
one good joint of meat properly, because there is
no way of hanging the pot up off the fire, the
fierce boil does not penetrate, & the stone coal
is hurt with the pressure of the weight, the girl
is much fretted, being a good servant, & one that
understands cookery, my husband talks of setting about
the new chimney without much delay:
I am greatly pleased with the [insertion]look of the[/insertion] Garden laid out
in thy plan, I think if kept neat it will be
beautiful, I had a Gardener at it 9 days setting
the box &c. an ingenious carpenter measured &
laid it out according to the plan, which he much
admired, & reckoned it the completest plan he ever
saw on paper for a Garden, I believe the box
will grow, however I have left some in the ground
to replace any that should fail, it is hard to please
every

every body, some reckon the garden spoiled, others
lament the well, but I am pleased myself,
& thou will be pleased I hope; & thus, I am
satisfied, because I shall often want thy information,
which I value more than that of most.
I have a fine large bed for tulips and renuncluses
(for I think it will hold what I have
of both) within side the garden door, I have got
some Gooseberry trees of a choice kind (I believe)
from J. [unclear]aller[/unclear] planted in the border laid out for
them & shrubs, I intend to plant some large
flowering shrubs at the four corners, & small
nice trees at the corner of my border for flowers
The gardener recommended my getting the plot
sodded, but I intend to follow thy direction & sow seeds
I was the more anxious to get the garden regulated
because the walks wanted graveling so badly, &
I did not like to let them remain dirty another
summer, & reducing their size was the first step
to take, this [insertion]is[/insertion] a comical correspondence on a
garden. I want to acquire knowledge in the
art
