3rd mo. 1824
My dear E
I am sorry I have
no good acts to give
of my father save
that a blister which
was put on the back
of his neck has risen
& we hope he will
get a better rest
than last night
the girls are all
waiting for a
favorable [unclear]change[/unclear]
which I hope I can
tell thee of soon
at present I am much
hurried & must cut short this note
I send two [unclear]h[/unclear] handkerchiefs which
I had bought for thee before the last
order arrived I could not get the
pattern of the others but will try
for it when I can
I had a letter with good [unclear]acts[/unclear]
from my mother to day
farewel thy [unclear][/unclear]
E Leadbeater
