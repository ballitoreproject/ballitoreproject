From the same to Anne Elly         5th


Dear Friend,                                                                 Ballitore 1/12 month 1779


+++ Remember us very affectionately to thy worthy husband, who I believe advances not only in his journey, but in a preparation for a happy conclusion of it. Remember us nearly to the young couple who are now united as one flesh: may they become one in a right spirit, that spirit which clothed and dignified some of their ancestors, and caused them to prefer the Friendship of God, all powerful, to the friendship of the world which is vain & fallacious. Remember us very kindly to the girls, I wish them to dwell in humility and walk in fear, that fear which preserves from the snares of death, laid by an assiduous, insidious adversary, who is constantly on his watch to deceive and betray, and if he cannot prevail to draw into scandalous immoralities, will endeavour to lift up the mind above that safe and sweet state in which true comfort and solid happiness are only to be enjoyed. Our dear love to thy sister Beale if with you thee, and besure accept of the same from us all, particularly from my better half, and
thy truly affectionate friend
Richard Shackleton
