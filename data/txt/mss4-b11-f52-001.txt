Dear Mother
This is to let thee know that I am at Psent
in a good state of health hoping that this will find thee in the Enjoyment
of the same Blessing; I was very sorry to hear that thee was
ill of the Cold, but am heartily glad to hear that thee is better; I hope
thee won't impute my long Silence to any Disrespect for it wou'd
be the greatest Pleasure I cou'd have to let thee know that I am,
sensible of my never being [insertion]able sufficiently[/insertion] to make thee a suitable Returne for
thy great Care of me, both when with thee [insertion]&[/insertion] since [unclear]I[/unclear] but when I have had
an Opportunity of writing I have been mostly so busy that I had
not time; please to let me know & first hand how thee Enjoys
thy [underline]Health for the Continuance of wch. I shoud be very ungrateful for[/underline]
thy Eaternal Care of me if I was not always anxious about, I am
with dear Love to thee, Brother, Sister &c.
Thy Affectionate Son
 Barcroft Fuller
