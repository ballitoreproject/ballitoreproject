And lately a Mechanics, & an Apprentices Libraries
were established, which promise to be highly useful
to the youth of the city. - Joseph Lancaster is
fixed in Baltimore, where I understand he has a large
School, & is doing pretty well. -
In the beginning of 10th month, I left New York
for Indiana on a particular business, & altho' I had an
interesting journey, yet it would have been much more
so, but for two reasons - the lateness of the season, & the
want of a companion. - I reached Baltimore just
at the commencement of the Yearly Meeting, & attended
its opening: - there, I saw Wm Forster Jr & Jesse Kersey, - the
latter has quite recovered the use of his jaw, & is as
eloquent a speaker as ever. I am sorry (for your sake)
to hear that he has given up all thoughts of a visit
to Europe at present. - From Baltimore I proceeded
to Pittsburg, where I embarked on "La belle
Riviere", as the French, very appropriately named
the majestic Ohio, & descending it, I dis-embarked at
Galliopolis, in the state of Ohio, whence I travelled
over land to Chillicothe, Maysville, Lexington, Frankfort
& Louisville (Kentucky.) I was rather disappointed
with Ohio. - it did not exhibit that beautiful
appearance of comfort & simplicity, which my imagination,
from reading [insertion]the[/insertion] descriptions of travellers, had assigned
it. - Yet, the people have [insertion]an[/insertion] abundance of the necessaries

of life, & I dare say, feel quite happy. - The population
has been made up from citizens of every state in the
Union, & European emigrants. - but this mixture, creates
rather a curious general character for society, & at first
offends the nice taste of a traveller. - Of course, there will
be found many detached spots, where a body of settlers
may have preserved the precise manners, which they brought
with them, - & this observation, I should think, applies
most truly to Friends, who thou knows, are seldom, in
this respect, acted upon, by external circumstances. However
I travelled too quickly thro' the state, to observe
any thing very minutely, & therefore I may err in my
conclusions. - Kentucky is a very fine state, &
I saw the best part of it, with which I was both surprised
& pleased. - Lexington is a large town of
6000 Inhabitants, situated in the midst of what may
almost be termed a garden. - the country about it, is
highly cultivated, neatly laid out in farms, & interspersed
with numerous Seats of gentlemen of property. - It has
a University, which at present contains 300 students, &
some able Professors. - and all this, in the "backwoods"
of America! The Slaves are well treated here, &
seem happy enough. - I saw no instances of ill usage
where I travelled. - Indiana is the reverse of
Kentucky - rough, uncultivated, & thinly settled - but I only
saw the worst parts of it. I had a desire to

visit Morris Birkbeck's settlement in Illinois, but my time
did not permit. - On my return to Kentucky, I spent
several days most delightfully at the Country Seat of an
old gentleman, who was a native of Dublin, but who
emigrated, before the Revolutionary War, in which he took
an active part. He is very rich, has a charming family,
([underline]one, un[/underline]married daughter) & lives in handsome style. - I became
intimate in their social circle, & departed with
much regret, - refusing their kind solicitations to "put over
the Christmas" with them. How delightful it is, to
meet with such incidents, where you least expect
them - they leave a sweet impression on the memory
which after events cannot obliterate!
I returned to Newyork, by nearly the same route, & arrived
on the 3d of 1st month. Had it been autumn or spring, I wd.
have come home thro' Virginia, & visited the two Ex. [underline]Kings[/underline]
Jefferson & Madison - besides the natural bridge, great cave
&c. - but this pleasure, I hope is yet to come.
I intend to send over my Journal of this tour shortly,
altho' it is not of course, so interesting as that to Niagara.
I don't know how I have managed to
fill nearly three sheets with nothing at all! - nor how
many more I [underline]would[/underline] fill, did not a sense of propriety
arise just at this moment, to suggest, that I have intruded
rather too far already, upon thy time & patience. - therefore
I must bid thee adieu - requesting that when not engaged
in more important avocations thou would be so kind as
to favor me, with another of thy interesting Epistles
Thou will please remember me affectionately to all those friends in whose
memory I still retain a place, - particularly thy own family, - the Mill - Jas.
White's - not forgetting Betsy S., whose lively humor & instructive conversation
are always fresh in my memory. - & last tho' not [underline]least[/underline] my old nurse Dolly.
Abm & Mary Bell & their four fine children are very well & desire to
be remembered to thee & thy sister Sally.- Once more farewell
believe me thy affect friend

I wrote Tommy Fisher last month -
I hope the family will not come here
without first sending out James as a Pioneer -
I send this letter under cover to Wm J Harvey, Belfast, who will
forward it to thee, together with a small book of which I beg thy
acceptance - It is a poem called "Judgement" written by a young
American of this City, who has appeared once before in print.
The subject is the Last Day which of course, for its delineations must
depend upon the fancy or imagination of the writer. I think it
reflects credit upon him altho' [underline]I[/underline] should have preferred
another subject. - As a specimen of [underline]American[/underline] poetry, it
will no doubt prove acceptable to thee.
