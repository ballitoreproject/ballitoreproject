x 27th He and Papa went in to town this
morning. Who should come over to
dinner but Doctor Henry and Catherine. it
was very pleasant, they walked all the way
out returned on foot too. At dinner
the Doctor and Philip kept up a lively
conversation, of which the chief topic was
the word 'wrong' and I think we all
agreed pretty well on the subject. As well
as I recollect he said there was no such
thing as wrong, [underline]because[/underline] no one yet
could agree what was wrong, each person
judged for himself, and each had a
different standard to judge by. [deletion]He also[/deletion]
[deletion]said[/deletion], "We should be guided by our own
conscience" said Philip. "Conscience"! replied
the Doctor, "what is it"? "Your conscience
is made for you, and depends upon
your training and education", and I
think he was right
Papa and Charlie came out again tonight
We expect Uncle T and Aunt E to dinner on 6th.. day.
