26[underline]th[/underline],, Friday - St Stephen's day -
and a remarkably clear and sunny
one but very cold and frosty -
I was just wishing to go to town
[deletion]id[/deletion] and wondering how I would
get in when [deletion]f[/deletion] way opened most
unexpectedly and we had our drive
in and out quite safe -.
We dined at Tanners off three
chops which were very good and
piping hot - Miss Tivy and the
two little Newmans returned with
us - The ball is going on now
and is quite a grand affair -
The ladies looked very stylish -
I ran down awhile ago to see what
[unclear]I[/unclear] could from the corridor, when
just as I was making my observations
out sailed a lady with gentleman
and off I flew to be sure -
The room seemed pretty full
and supper table laid out in the
drawing room
