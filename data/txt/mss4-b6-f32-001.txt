I this moment received your letter, the Newspaper
account that you mentioned was the truth of poor
Went's Death which happened on the 19th of October
last in the County of Cork when he was out Hunting,
he never spoke after he got the fall, every help that
could be got he had, he died about Twentyeight
[deletion]after[/deletion] hour after he met with [insertion]the[/insertion] accident, it was occasioned
by the mouthpiece of his Bridle breaking
when he was galloping - My Brother George
is in the Army again and is in the East Indies, I
had a letter from him lately he was at that time
very well, he mentioned the place he was in was
very [deletion][/deletion] sickly and that some of his officers
died there - I believe My Eldest son will stop at
your House going to Dublin with some of his Family

of [unclear]Wrents[/unclear] Death, it was at his place he died

Ah why in [deletion]yo[/deletion] life & health's full bloom
Perish'd my lov'd, mine early friend,
And why to that untimely tomb
Must so much worth & truth descend?
That generous heart's last beat is o'er
That heart which throbb'd for other's wo,
And those closed eye-lids shall no more
Permit Compassion's tear to flow
[deletion]Though[/deletion] Good Humour bade thy converse shine
And cheat with blameless Mirth the hour
Yet ever ready to resign
Her sprightly sway to Pity's power
And Memory on thy name shall dwell
And fond regret the sigh shall rend,
Then take, O take this last farewell
My long-beloved, mine early friend.
