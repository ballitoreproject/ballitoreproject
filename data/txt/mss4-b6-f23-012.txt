Moulded by Nature's happy art
A cloudless brow & joyous heart
Retain these ever gentle maid
In paths of peace & duty led
And [deletion]wise[/deletion] [insertion]good[/insertion] as fair & [deletion]good[/deletion] [insertion]wise[/insertion] as gay
Now in the morning of thy day
Never may folly, guilt or pain
Enter thy bosom's sacred fane
Caution with innocence combin'd
Reflection - with a candid mind
Ever be there, so shalt thou prove
In every state respect & love
Goodhumour smile upon thy cheek
How dear th[deletion]y[/deletion][insertion]at[/insertion] charm I need not speak
Thine be the case to keep that
charm thro' life.
O guard it well as maid[insertion]en[/insertion] & as wife
Ne'er let it fail thee in the [unclear]face[/unclear] of strife
