				Dublin 23rd of Secondmonth 1779.
	My Dear Love,
		This day is over: it is near nine oâ€™clock. It has been a memorable day, to be commemorated by me and mine with humble gratitude. The meeting was solemn and favoured. The spirit of thy poor husband, prostrated in reverent, humble gratitude, and baptized in the Deeps. Surely if this connexion was not of the Lord, surely his power would not be so evidently felt in the solemnization of it. Gratitude, my dear, gratitude has overcome my heart for this addition of favour. We have had this evening a good religious opportunity after tea, in which dear James Gough was, I think well concerned: as he was remarkably in the public meeting, both in testimony, before the parties took each other in marriage, and afterwards in supplication. **
