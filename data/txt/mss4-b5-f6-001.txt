According to my Arabella's request, I begin on a separate
paper to answer that part of thy letter which I was
prevented doing the last time I wrote. I shall begin
where thou does, there thou tells me that thy Mother
thou thinks will not be like to pay a visit to Ballitore;
this is news very unwelcome & I wish thou may be
disappointed in thy fears, do not bl[deletion][/deletion]ame me for wishing
thee a disappoinment, for I hope it would not be a
disagreeable one. I am sensible that the loss of so tender
a Parent as thine was, & so good an example, must be
very great; but, my dear, we should not [insertion]lax[/insertion] the divine disposal,
but consider that, "Whatever is, is right." not that I would
p[deletion]e[/deletion]r[insertion]e[/insertion]tend to imagine that one must stiffle the emotions of
nature, which it is impossible to do & thou thyself, I am
confident considers the kindness of Providence in sparing thee
thy Mother & thy Aunt. I do not wonder if thou shudders at
the idea of the danger she has escaped. Thou art very welcome
to communicate thy griefs to me, it is the duty of a friend
to administer comfort, which I will do, as far as is in my power.
But I should thank thee for thy parody which thou wert
so kind as to send me, I do not forget thy promise of sending
me any of thy poetical performances which thou may at
times compose for thy amusement; & I shall take it as a
proof of thy affection thou art so kind as to profess for me;
& I cannot but think thou must compose pretty often as
thou has a twin that way, & to any that have, I think it
must come quite natural when alone to amuse themselves
that way; we always have a fund of entertainment in ourselves
to divert solitude, if the mind is not stained with quill; but if

if it is, solitude is unsupportable & heart corroding refections
prey on both mind & body: may this, my dear Bell, never be the
case with thee or thy friend! I hope it never will; we have a
kind & merciful Father, who, if we look to him aright, will
guide & protect us, through ev'ry toilsome path & intricate
labyrinth in this vale of wo, though as yet I cannot call it
so by experience, for I have had little of its sorrows, for
which I wish I was truly thankful, I am sorry that any
portion of it's sorrows has fallen to thy lot & made thee at so
early an age out of conceit with it; I can hardly think (but
do not doubt thy veracity) that [insertion]thou[/insertion] art so in love with solitude
as to prefer it to the amusements of town; but no doubt thou
views (by the light of reason & sense) these amusements
in a proper light, that they draw the mind from what it
should be fixed on & carry it away on the wings of varity,
drowning all serious reflections, making the mind giddy
with diversion & unfit to judge for itself, or to see the ruin
to which with hasty & joyful steps it is approaching, &
in those few moments when it can think it finds nothing,
pleasing in the reflection - & in the end bitterly laments
the loss of time, so foolishly spent in the pursuit of a bubble:
as the manner in which I am educated, & the rules of our
society afford no room for my knowledge of it, I cannot
speak from experience, but [insertion]from[/insertion] what I hear & imagine; Tell me
dost thou coincide with my opinion. I think a cheerful
agreeable neighbourhood domestick harmony & improving
friends, are preferable to any thing else, I add a self approving
mind conscious of being right; may we, my dear, experience
this, 'tis the best wish I can give my friend,
could wishes avail. Thou says I will think thee romantick
forgive

forgive me if I do, a [underline]little[/underline], but thy youth & lively imagination
are an ample excuse: & I doubt not when judgement has
matured a good understanding. that my dear Bell will be
a Shining Woman, especially if Humility, the ornament
of every virtue, be joined with superiour accomplishments
without this nothing can please, it is the salt which
preserves the other virtues from decay, why is the violet so
beloved? with it's sweetness it adds Humility. Think not my
dear Bell that I mean to accuse thee of Pride, or judge myself
capable of advising, I am much wronged if thou harbours such
a thought I only speak my sentiments with the sincerity
which one friend should use to another, & which I thought
would be agreeable to thee, without sincerity, Friendship
is nothing... I should not be so free in communicating my
sentiments to thee, dis I not rely on thy [insertion]not[/insertion] shewing this to
any; thy concern lest thy Mother should feel by the remembrance
of her loss is very laudable; [deletion]so[/deletion] [insertion]we[/insertion] should avoid
pairing those to whom our obligations are so many, & so
great an obedience is due, very blameable will we be, if by
word or action we cause them a pang, & will most certainly
incur the divine displeasure. I wonder thou would
be backward in shewing thy performance, I should be very
ridiculous, if I criticise on another's compositions, when my
own afforded a much larger field for criticim.
My pen grows bad & my time is shortened, therefore let
me now take my leave, & do not be offended [insertion]at[/insertion] or put any wrong
constructions on what I have wrote, but remember that
sincerity is the characteristic of a friend. 28th / 1 mo. 1776
