Aunt was there, I drove down to see G
who was just going out to drive. She
met us [insertion]soon[/insertion] after in Mrs McDonald's - and looked
right well - Aunt read me a [underline]story[/underline] this eve
10 Tuesday - We took no less than two
drives to day - first one down to
Bray and then one after dinner round
to Ballyman where [insertion]we[/insertion] called to see if there
was any sign of Margt who was coming
out - but neither Mary nor Phil were
there so home we came, by Enniskerry
at a spinning rate - I was riding
and an emulation sprung up between
the mare and [unclear]Jean[/unclear] - it was very
pleasant - Before dinner we had
gone to the Dargle - Who should
appear at tea time but Magt and
Ned - a welcome surprise
