My dear Friend
I am very sorry that
we had not the pleasure of your
& Sarah's company during your
visit to Carlow, but I cannot
blame you, as I think it very
wrong to put ourselves in danger
of fever where we are conscious
that we cannot be of use to the
invalid. Barcroft, we hope, is
getting better, & his fever has been
very mild - Judy we expect will
also have the disease mildly, but
as I am still very weak & not
well able to pay much attention
to our invalids, I would find my
self much easier if Judy's mother
were here to take care of her.

Perhaps you would be so kind
as to request she may come as
soon as possible -
Yours very truly
S H Haughton
