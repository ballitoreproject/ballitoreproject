the day here - After dinner we
went to walking - Mary Strangman
had returned with us. We were
going down the avenue, Charlie following
us in the children's gig, Lilly pushing
him. I thinking to help her began to
pull when [deletion]wh[/deletion] back went the girl
and poor Charlie on [underline]his[/underline] back, He
seemed greatly hurt and was very
nearly fainting. I was quite frightened
and indeed all of us [insertion]seemed so[/insertion]: however
he grew better after awhile and
we brought him up in the gig,
and then pursued our walk,
met Philip who had gone up to
meet us on the hill at the Sand
pit - Oh the view there was most
beautiful, the evening [underline]so[/underline] fine.
Philip parted from us after awhile
and went home across the river.
On returning we found Charlie in
bed, the best place for him I think -
The Whites left us after tea -
