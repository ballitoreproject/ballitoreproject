Dear Cousin
R. Shackleton/

Soon after I received thy acceptable favor Cousin John Bradford was removed I hastened in a few days after the funeral to my sister, she was near her time, nearer than I imagined as it proved  she was agreeable surprised & rejoiced to see me, she did not expect me til the week following  I came the 29th of last month, ^third day of the week^ only just in time  she was taken ill the next day & was delivered of a fine Boy about 5 in the evening  she had a fainting fit soon after her delivery which alarmed me greatly but had a tolerable night, on fifth day she was chearful & seemed bravely, she rested little in the night but on sixth day morning was very drowsy in the afternoon about three o clock she awoke after a short sleep & rather rambled, she was not hot or feverish but looked very pale, she did not talk much, twice she said O tis a fearful bonny house on seventh day she altered greatly  once she spoke to her eldest daughter & sometime after strove to speak to me but could not, she continued in that situation til about nine in the evening when she was released from a painful Life, & is at Rest I doubt not  Rachel Wilson & Barbara Sharples attended the funeral on third day the 5th instant. She told me the evening before she was taken ill, if she was taken away (as she was rather apprehensive having been differently carried on for sometime than when in that situation before) she hoped it would be well with her or to this Effect adding I dont speak it boastingly 
She earnestly requested that if it should be so that her Children as many of em as were fit might be placed amongst Friends 
She has left some advice in writing to her Husband & Children  I intend thee a copy the first opportunity  It has been a trying time to me  a Scene of deep distress  the poor Children what he will do with them I know not but by no means should they stay with their Father if he will consent to their removal but I fear he will prove perverse  their Mother was prudent & kept things much to her self  he was not the best of Husbands
The Children might be soon placed I am persuaded would he consent, Cousin Morris has been here & has said what he could, & will do his utmost for them but whether he can make any thing of him or no I cant tell  The Camberts [?] have been finished & at Lancaster sometime waiting for Captain Greenwood  I hope they will please, I have not seen them but Cousin Morris says he thinks them good
I am with dear love to all my Cousins thy truly Affectionate Kinswoman

A line the first opportunity will be very acceptable
