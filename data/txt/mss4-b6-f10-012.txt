Dear friend
Mary Leadbeater
I Recd. thy letter this day (no date) enclosing
one from our Jams. 4 days old - the public ways are so obstructed
by an uncommon fall of snow for the season. I know not when
this can be forwarded - above is copy of the few subscribers we
have got - the unliterary cast of the people here will plead
our excuse for the smallness of the number - I have got a
letter from Joseph Jacob with Thos Clarksons proposals for
another works, Prospectus of the 1st vol. of a work - wch. is to be
PS My wife desires me to add - that our Nancy
is fearful her poor old mother may suffer want
in this pinching season, & desires Mary Doyle will
please to advance her 5/5 - I want also from
thee or Sally a copy of thy mothers letter to David
Hume in consequence of calling the [underline]Quakers deists[/underline]
& his answer to sd. letter - I sent Wm. some [unclear]poctual[/unclear]
productions of this place what sayest thou of them

comprised in two thick octavo volumes, containing the history of the
rise progress & accomplishment of that great event the abolition
of the Slave trade wth proper engravings priced 1L-5s-0d British"
and proposing my endeavouring for subscribers half the money
to [insertion]be[/insertion] paid in hand - we have made application to several &
no likelihood of one being got here - the people are so indifferent
about such events besides the book appears so
high as to entitle the author to the name of book-maker -
however I cd not have any of our selfish motives to influence
our friends in the village any more nor any
less than they may think right - if thou canst get
any names for it return them me I wd send the prospectus
had we more than one -
I think upon the whole it wd. be very well to enshrine
these philant[insertion]h[/insertion]ropists who have unceasingly espoused [deletion]the[/deletion]
the cause of suffering humanity provided the [unclear]traping[/unclear] I shoud
not be too costly or self-unpleasant
Annexed I intend extracts from Jno Hancocks letter in Edwd
Rushtons case - had this event happened in the days of antient
superstition & credulity, & been handed down to us in an
eastern dress - I have no doubt it wd have obtained the character
of a divine Miracle - and even in this day of free-thinking
have we not reason to acknowledge God as the great first
cause of every useful discovery - and unless his mighty hand
guide [insertion][underline]& prosper[/underline][/insertion] that of the artist - vain is the help of man -

unless the Lord build the house & keep the City - the builders and
the watchmen - build & watch in vain - I wish the present builders
& pretended watchmen in the degenerate society wd. honestly attend
to these few yet forcable expressions, if so I believe many of their
buildings wd. fall to pieces & they wd. have to bewail their self-[unclear]activity[/unclear]
as in dust & ashes -
Lisburn 10.mo 26 - 1807
I had a letter lately from Edwd. Rushton, he speaks wth much feeling
of his returning sight, he says "after being for more than 30 yrs
excluded from a glim[insertion]p[/insertion]se of [deletion]light[/deletion] the world, I can walk 
about, read with the assistance of a glass 30 or 40 pages of a folio
edition of Pope [deletion]s works[/deletion] and what is still more interesting to my
feelings, I can distinguish the features of my family" he speaks
of the marriage of his daughter in the following manner
"After all man is but a bundle of habits, and when these
habits are abruptly broken in upon, a sort of mental laceration
takes place, my daughter had been my close companion
for years, and I feel her loss most sensibly,
the parent who [deletion]woud[/deletion] from motives of mere convenience
woud obstruct, or even retard the happiness of his
child, must in my opinion be selfish & contemptible
in the extream" he sends me a copy of a letter wch
he wrote some time ago to Thos. Paine, urging him to advocate
the cause of the blacks, and remonstrating with him, for having
neglected them, to this letter T: P made no reply but
has since declined writing to him, Rushton well observes
"I wish politicians & philosophers woud learn to be consistant
Jefferson the president of the united states, the freest

country in the world, holds hundreds of his fellow creatures in
a state of bondage, and Horne Tooke the celebrated English patriot
is an enemy to the abolition of the slave trade" - I thought
these little extracts & acct. of this interesting Rushton woud
be acceptable to thee & many men of our Ballitore friends
I wd send J: Hancocks letter if a safe conveyance offered
he is one of my most intimate & valuable correspondents
& I believe a genuine Christian in his heart & conduct
tho stigmatised by the ignorant & prejudiced, as a dangerous
schismatick, heretick & other opprobrious names
farewll thy affte friend Sam Haughton

If ML. has any books she would approve of for James
Haughtons reading (out of school) she would oblige his
Mother by lending him such as she thinks proper -
he has written home for some - & we have none, that seems suitable,
