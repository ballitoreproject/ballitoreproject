seventh day 26th 4th mo 1833,
My dear Eliza
It is a long time now since I wrote to thee
but thou has heard of of us since, that we are all well
and just as usual, the two children are here still
Emy is very cross these two days back, her teeth I
suppose are troubling her, she has got quite sunburnt
being out so much. the greatest news I
have to tell thee is that Richard & Elizth are coming
to the cottage on the road, I hope thou
may not have heard it before thou wilt get this
or thou wilt think we have no mind to tell
thee any thing, we only knew it ourselves on fifth
day night, when my Mother had a note from
Richard saying they were to leave mary St the
eighth of next month, and would be moving out
after the meeting; R & E spent second day here
with their precious daughter. they spoke of it that
day which was the first I heard of it, so they will
be new neighbours. another thing I have to say is
the Lunells have been looking at the house &
who knows but against thou comes home, [underline]We[/underline]
may be safely transplanted to the other cottage
however that is not decided yet. we are not to
move until the house is actually set. Edward &

Sarah & the seven children were here on third day
so thou may think we had a housefull, Ed seems
finely, looks well and seems in pretty good spirits
S & children all well. Manliff & I went to town on
fifth day we staid but a short time. I went to
inquire how Mary Gough was who had been very
ill my Aunt had been greatly frightened, I found
her finely she looks a little delicate, but was up &
dressed, I don't rightly know what ailed her, but after
taking some medicine which Dr Macready ordered
her she fainted, & that frightened my Aunt so much
it is well it did not happen the meeting week as
they are to have Josiah & his wife in town. I saw
Martha at Britain Street she & John were up
at Round wood on first day, they went on seventh
day night and returned on second day morning.
they are both well [deletion]well[/deletion]: it is fixed for Frederic to
sleep at Dominick Street, when Mary street is given
up, poor Mary street we will miss it. I am just after
tying up the nosegays for the meeting they are
now all ready to go in tomorrow. I believe it was
this time twelvemonths we could scarcely get flowers
enough to make them out, but that is not the case
 now for there are plenty of Narcisse & Jonquils &&.-
I had to make three attempts before I had enough
& each time my hand was so full there was

a pain in my thumb tell Elizabeth that I have
one for Sally amongst them; I saw her not very long
since and she looked very well and chearful. I
hope to get my Mother to go in tomorrow & leave
the children here with me, as I think it would
 be a great bother to go bring them in to town Emy
I think would be crying all day if she was brought
in they are all to dine at Mary street which is
old still thou knows, Arthur does not intend going
in so he & I may keep house. I have not seen or
heard any thing of the Henrys this good while Thomas
will wait untill [underline]thou[/underline] comes home
ere [underline]he[/underline] will pay us a visit I suppose.
I know of no one coming to the meeting
tho' they say it is likely to be large so many
were disappointed last year, which I think is
likely enough to be the case. There is great talk here
of the rail road, a great many ma[insertion]n[/insertion]y have come up from
the country I believe to see & get employment at it
Paddy Redmond Jr & Johnny [unclear]Kirwan[/unclear] are both gone
the former seems to to have cooled on Van Diemens
Land, they are to get nine shillings a week which
is a fine thing for Johnny as he will be better able
to help his mother. poor Ally is almost half way
by this, she sailed the seventeenth. I wonder how she
feels. And now it is almost time to say something
about thee. I am afraid thou art not growing stout

and that thou wilt not return as well as we could
wish, why dost thou do anything to give thee cold,
I hear of thy having had three or four colds since thou
went down which is a thing I dont like at all -
Martha told me she had a letter from thee & to judge
from what thou said she thought thee but middling
surely thou ought to try and get as stout as thou can.
but thou wilt only laugh at me for all this lecturing
and tell me that I ought to practice before I preach.
Give my dear love to Elizabeth you will have fine
fun next week I suppose all I say is take care of thy
self. Farewell & with dear love I am thy affecte Sister Selina

My Mother desires her love ands says that if [unclear][/unclear] should he
that we are to move to this cottage. (which she thinks is
very uncertain) she does not wish thee to come home untill
we are settled there. She wishes thee to stay quietly untill
it is all over, so thou may make thy mind easy and do
as thou art bid, be sure write soon.
