Thou wilt please give my affecte remembrance
to James White & his wife, A Taverner & H Haughton,
the Mill family, thy sister Sally, Betsey Barrington,
Abby Widdows, & in fact all my old friends.- Tell
my Nurse Dolly, that her remembrance of me, was
very acceptable. I presume there are none of
my old Schoolfellows in Ballitore now. - It is
more than five years since I left the "Classic Vale" -
But I hope it will not be quite so many,
before I re-visit it. -
With best regards
several members of your family, &
hoping soon I have the pleasure of again
hearing from thee, I subscribe myself
with Sincerity
thy affecte. friend
