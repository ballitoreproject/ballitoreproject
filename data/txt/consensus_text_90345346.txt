24th.. When out walking we were continually
meeting an old gentleman out driving about
in a gig, who always stopped to speak
to the Whites - This was Mr Chaine [insertion]proprietor[/insertion] [deletion][/deletion]
of [deletion]the[/deletion] more than [underline]20[/underline] bleaching mills
as well as I recollect. He is a very [unclear]singular[/unclear]
old gentleman, wealthy and a widower
has several children all married I believe
and now has one of his daughters
in law a widow with three children
living with him. Well yesterday
[unclear]evening[/unclear] an invitation for us all to
dine with him the next day at
six O'clock came , to which was
sent an answer in the affirmative
Doctor Fisher was included in the
general invitation, but not having
any fancy for these kind of dinner
parties, he intended - excusing himself
and I believe Liddy had settled to stay
also and keep him company. However
this morning while we were working
who should drive up but Mr Chaine
