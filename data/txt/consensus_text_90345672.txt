Margt. Mary and Rebecca were
there - of the boys only young George
a dreadfully shy youth who appeared in
the distance and at dinner -
After it Mary Rebecca and I went to
take a row in the boat and as Richard joined
us and acted the part of rower we had
great sailing about and went up as far
as the bridge, the river was very full
of weeds which certainly did not lighten
the task of the poor rower -
As I wanted to go to see Emily Mason
who was then staying at her Aunt's
the Leckeys - we left Griesemount
rather earlier and meeting Thos
with the phaeton, drove to the old
school house where they live - However
our visit was useless for having knocked
and rung four times in vain, we came
away in despair concluding that all
were out - The drive home on that
beautiful evening was very pleasant
We walked to the Shultyes where
we were going to spend the evening -
and enjoyed it too -
There was no variety in the company
