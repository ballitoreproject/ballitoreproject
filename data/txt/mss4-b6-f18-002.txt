Austel in Cornwal. 7th mo 25th
1786
Dear Molly
I wrote from Plymouth abt. 10 days since jointly to thyself,
Bror. Abram. & Sister Sarah not then intending to add to yr. Expence in
Postage. since which having receiv'd a Letter dated the 17th Inst. from dear
Wm. Matthews, informing of his Intention to embark from Bristol in the
Ship St. James for New York, to sail the 25th and that dear Jno. Pemberton
was gone further No. in the Islands beyond Scotland & well. dr M Jenkins well
in Surrey with S.S. P.B. in Hampshire. Z.D. gone tods Scotland. Ann
Jessop in Lincolnshire. G.D. with R Wright & Coo. had dropt Anchor at
Norwich till a fair wind. & that our precious S.D. is very happy as usual
at L. Murray's Hold gate near York, I thought I wou'd convey the general
Tidings in said Lettr. to thee, believing that if the dear frds. at Ballitore
(that pleasing Retreat) are not (as the Yorkshire folks say) fashd with
hearing abt. us [underline]poor Americans[/underline], it will afford some entertainment, as well
as renew that Sympathy in which my dear S. Grubb & self, so largely shared
when with you, & which we still wish may be continued, that yr kind
remembrance of us poor Pilgrims may furnish us [insertion]with[/insertion] occasional[deletion]ly[/deletion] pleasingly
to conclude, that you are not so carefully observant of that old Proverb
"Out of Sight out of Mind" as we fear'd. And as one inducement to let us hear
once more from you, let me ask the Question. What is become of the
Book of Manuscripts, which thou & dear Abram, engaged to prepare
for me against the Y. M. last in London? I dont give up my claim, [unclear]so[/unclear]
as the word of an honest man is as good as his Bond, having had yours
shall hope you will not fail to send it by some suitable conveyance,
which dear Robt. Grubb will be, who will probably in a few weeks
cross the Channel hither - and now I am in the line of freedom, let me
desire another kindness at thy hands, viz. procure me half a Dozen
knit worsted Pincushions of the frd. at Mt. melick, three of them in
a deep green & white. the other three Pompadore & white, without
Initials. & desire RG. to pay the expence, or if thou hast not oppory
with him, I will take Care to remit the Cost to thee, but on no other
terms [underline]will[/underline] I accept them, so mind that, & act accordingly -
We are now near the Land's End, and have in this County met with
divers valuable honest frds. amongst whom are some promising Young People,
we have been refresh'd in their Company, & believing dear Cathrne. Phillips
has not laboured in vain amongst frds. in these Parts, we are encouraged
Since writing this, have a Letter from home saying Wm. Brown is deceased. the [insertion]3[/insertion] frds. from England all well, also our frd
S. [unclear]Sanders[/unclear] (who continues to wish he had not made so hasty an escape home -

therefrom to hope our little Service will not be wholly lost. O 'tis a
lovely Sight when we behold the beloved Youth willingly stooping to the
crucifying Power, & resigning themselves to the holy Harness, it is [unclear]animat[/unclear]
comfortable, & raises a joyous hope, that there will be a succession of [unclear]valian[/unclear]
under the Banner of the Prince of Peace; may these & the visited Child.
of my heavenly father in yr Land, make a total surrender of their Wills
to his holy Will, that as little Children, in pure simplicity, they may be
"taught to go" and in the approved Season be enabled "to [underline]run[/underline] without
weariness, & walk without fainting" in the Path of Obedience, witnessing
all the "Ways of divine Wisdom to be ways of pleasantness, & all her Paths
Peace" is my affectionate fervent desire. that so when the few [unclear]stakes[/unclear]
which remain in our Zion, may in providential direction be removed,
"instead of the Fathers (& Mothers) these may be the Children", who clad
with the same Mantle of holy Zeal for the grt. & good Cause of Truth
& Righteousness , may shew forth His Praise, who is calling with an
high & holy Calling, yea renewing his Proclamation to the North, "Give 
& to the South "Keep not back" and bringing Sons from far, & [unclear]Daughters[/unclear]
from the Ends of the Earth, who if they "keep all his Commandments
always, "hath graciously determined it shall be well with them, & their
Children for ever." and that the Children of my much lov'd fds. Ric'd
& Eliza Shackleton may happily become of this number, is my continued
desire
Salute me to thy dr Parents, to all thy Connections
to whom I am known, & to my acquaintance at Ballitore particularly
dear Anna Taverner, whose faith & patience I hope is maintained, &
who is under the Care of the grt. & blessed Physician, who formerly
declared himself to be "The Lord that healeth" -
My dear Compn. unites in the offer of best Love to all the
above named - & to besure to her Robt. if he comes in thy way, tell him
we are well -
Now though I have express'd a wish to hear from you
I desire no communication in any other Channel than perfect friends
which has produced the present salutation from thy affectionate frd
