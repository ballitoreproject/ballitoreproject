My dear Molly
I believe it will be very unexpected to thee
to receive affew lines from me yet I believe it wile
not be disagreeable though it may be to give thee
a little trouble for a friend. James Christy jur.
he requests me to ask thee to get him a piece of
Sagathy he would like it a good deal darker then what
thou had in Dublin. Since I parted thee I thought
several times about the payment of what thou wast
to get for me, it felt very disagreable to me, not
knowing who it is, that is to advance the money.
I wish I could hand thee my proportion but as I do not
know the sum nor any way to get it to thee, I must
leave it at present and ask thy excuse for my

stupidity.
The day we left Dublin we got to Newrey very agreably
James is a pleasing companion on a journey as elsewhere
Eleanor Whitfield was my other companion, please tell Sally
that she was greatly taken with her by the sight she got
of her, in J. Bewleys hall, she sayd she felt a great
love for her and admired her much. I believe she is an
innosant creature. the next morning we got to
Stromore to breakfast where I met dear M. Pike she
is the same cheerful pretty little Woman. She stayd untill
first day evening, Brother and Sister came third day, and
I with them, left that on forth day. James has improved
the house much by raising the roof, that with three fine
Children has made some alterations in Stramore sinse.
thou sow it, I wish thou would come while I am in
this province, and renew thy acquaintance. I must

not for get to tell thee that we found [underline]our own[/underline] poor Children
well, the are grown greatly since I saw them Joe sayd
he knew me, I believe he had some recolection of me.
farewell dear Molly please remember my love affection
to thy Mother and Sally, in which Brother and sister
joins me,
F. Strangman
