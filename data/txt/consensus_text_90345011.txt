friends to tea next
fourth day evening.
William and Hannah
Jacob, Willm & Lydia
Roberts, and of all the
people - young Sam
Bewley. We are to
go and invite Arthur
to morrow, if nothing
prevents, and if Marie
comes in we shall
be a nice little party.
I wrote to Polly to come
in, and spend this
week with us. Oh!
I hope she will -
Poor Margt has a
bad cold - she has
gone to bed and
J and I are writing
