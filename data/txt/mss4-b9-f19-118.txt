My dear E - Many thanks for the pot of ointment
please say what I owe thee for it - poor Mary
Doyle kept thy note & ointment till I sent for
them yesterday, she is in trouble about poor
Margt Wright who is not expected to recover
Abby is greatly to be felt for, thy father looks
very thin he consulted Cheyne who advises
him to ride a great deal on horse back, he
seem'd quite enliven'd by having got
the Dr.'s opinion I was sorry to hear that
Doctor D was so ill we cannot expect him
to live for ever - Ah thou forgot to send
J Graydon's book & he wanting it
so badly, Willy gets on very well
considering everything I did not think
he wd. have outlived that fine hardy
little felow of E [unclear]Gleyehaks[/unclear]
I persuaded my father to
come out with one last
night to see the children
excuse this had nothing
many thanks for the basket
full my father takes home
his basket I suppose she &
Abby will soon be home
ever thine SB

E Leadbeater
