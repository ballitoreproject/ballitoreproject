Wednesday
Dearest Wife
I am glad
to hear you are
coming home
either Saturday or
Monday - I hope
the former -
It is very extraordinary
that
Lyd should be
holding out so
long with so
little change
- does she continue
to be delirious?
or has she longer
seasons of sensibility
than she
had -
I hope [insertion]when[/insertion] you come
you wont be going

over to stop at
Orange Hill - but
will come & stay
at home - the
Princess of Wales
should be a warning
to you - I wish
you were here &
would make up
your mind to
stop here -
I have not seen
baby this week.
- but intend going
over to-morrow
evening - Rose
was over to-day
& says he looks well
& fat -
I had only James
& Ben Dickson for
dinner yesterday
your ever affec
husband [underline]Robert F.[/underline]
