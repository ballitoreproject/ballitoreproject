9th month
on the car - I wish I
had a little more "brass"
or perhaps I should call it
"sense" - for only the idea
of going by myself with
Ellen who however was quite
a stranger to them, put
me all in the tremors.
However I got over the business
tolerabl[deletion]l[/deletion]y, and as Ellen said
made no "[underline]blunders[/underline]."
We met Anne near the
house, just as we were
going to make a wrong turn,
for there are so many
different paths in the plantation,
they are very puzzling
to a person not well acquainted
with the place - Mary
instead of Susan had come
out to stay a few days, so
after paying a little visit
