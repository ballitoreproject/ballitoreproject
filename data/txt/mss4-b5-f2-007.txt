lines of the 12th, accompanied by proposals of printing by subscription

it shall, or 'till it may, I wish & mean to use same indenting in
promoting thy design, intending to inform thee the result -
My name may be set down for 6 books - Barcroft Haughton

Should any thing further occur to thee on the subject please to
let me know it timely. -
This being pretty much a letter of business, Vanishing not to

Thy affectionate friend
