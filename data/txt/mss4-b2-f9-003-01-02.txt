Ballitore: 14/3 month 1765
Dear Cousin Debby,
        My wife received thy agreeable letter of 18th ultimate, & on perusing of it I felt something of near unity & sympathy with thee. I am glad when I see the stretching forth of the crook of the Shepherd of Israel to gather into his fold: and I believe thou & my dear friend thy husband are objects of his peculiar regard & favour, whom he will bless in a still more abundant manner, if you steadily, humbly & diligently wait to feel the renewings of his sacred baptisms to keep your own hearts clean, and to qualify you for the parts ^posts^ & stations allotted you in his house. May we never, my dear friend, by our own doing, or not doing, defeat His gracious purposes towards us, or come short of the measure of the stature which his goodness & wisdom designs us. Let others, if they will, be great in the world, & seek the friendship & grandeur of it: if they succeed in their pursuit, & obtain all of it that they aim at, their happiness is embittered with many a surfeitting [sic] care, & their rest (such as it is) disturbed with many an anxious allay. Let us, dear Debby, ever covet [?] to have our minds clothed with humility: in this state we shall most comfortably enjoy the various blessings of this life, with which our great & good Benefactor has mercifully favoured us, & in this state only we will ^shall^, or can be prepared to received the unmixed happiness of the earnest of that life which is to come I salute you both, dear friends, in much affection, and, whatever becomes of me surrounded with besetments of various kinds, I heartily wish you well on your way, that ye might & useful may grow eminent & useful instruments in the good hand of Him that hath visited you & watches over you, that your lives may be full of successful & honourable labour, & your latter ends full of peace. ++++
thy truly affectionate friend & kinsman
Richard Shackleton
