From the same to the same.

My dear friend will I am persuaded believe that my pleasure was great when I heard that thou wert wast landed ++ I hope thou art now finely recruited after thy journey, and heartily desire that the several little changes and alterations ^which necessarily^ that attend a migration of this sort, may conspire to cherish, to comfort, to strengthen the constitution of thy inward frame ^[pencil note] x^ - Thou and I, my dear friend, are two poor, helpless creatures, who stand exceedingly in need of divine help - If he who made us will be graciously pleased to extend his merciful, condescending regard and care towards us; if he will take us into the protection of the hollow of his hand, and under the hiding of his power, we then shall live before him - otherwise we shall be agitated by every conflict, as reeds shaken by the wind, and even our natural lives, from one cause or other, become a burden - But I trust, my beloved friend, that he who hath visited and cultivated, and planted, and watered, and preserved will continue to cast a compassionate eye upon us, will support, and direct, and open our way before us - We are blind and ignorant; but he is perfectly wise, into whose hand we commit our spirits to be moulded, modelled, rectified and sanctified according to his will. Here then let us hold - let us leave all to him, who hath cared & will care for us, if we be chaste in our love to him, & faithful & obedient in every jot & tittle of his law legibly engraven on the tablet of our hearts - but remember, a little cloud intercepts the rays of the sun from us, & unfaithfulness in matters comparatively small will preclude the enlivening warmth & strengthening virtue of divine favour.
