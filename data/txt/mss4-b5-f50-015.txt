[10 Nov., 1821]
I must break through all my usual forms
of commencing a letter to call upon thee my dear friend,
who I am sure wilt sympathize with all my joys & sorrows
to rejoice along with me on the acquisition of a delightful
acquaintance in that most charming woman Mrs.
Archibald Graham, to whom I am much indebted to
our mutual friend Theodore Spiliot for giving me a
letter of introduction. I spent a most interesting hour
& a half with her yesterday. Before I was 5 minutes
in her company I felt almost as much at home
as if I were in Ballitore; she enquired & conversed
about you, mentioning your names, as if you were her
personal acquaintances - & one of her first enquiries was
for [underline]Mary[/underline] Leadbeater. She had so much to say, & what
she did say was so delightful that I found it almost
impossible to leave her. We ran through a great variety
I arrived in Edinburgh about [unclear]1[/unclear] in the evening ot the 25th ult.- I went immediately
to my hospitable landlady's Helen [unclear]Sullin's[/unclear] - & after I have [deletion][/deletion] made myself warm
with a cup of tea & a good fire,- I asked her for the letters which had arrived during
my absence with which I amused myself during the evening,- & among which I
have to acknowledge one from thee dated the 26th of 6th month.- Thou tells me in
it that you were much gratified with my account of my visit to Lanark,- of Samuel
Tuke, of Chalmers - & the tender moralist of Tweed - now I have several times since
been puzzling myself to make out who is "this tender moralist of Tweed" - I
suppose thou [deletion][unclear]ber[/unclear][/deletion] wilt think me very stupid not to know -. but it is a gratification
even to a stupid person to have his darkness enlightened,- These hopes I
keep a note-book of these remarkable incidents,- I reply that I have kept a regular
[deletion]journal[/deletion] diary of the events of my life since the commencement of 1817.- & often gratify
myself with perusing it - & glancing at some of its "sunny spots" - among which
I shall always consider - from 11 till half past 12 - on the 10th of the 11th month 1821.-
I take very kind this advice thou has given me about learning to [unclear][/unclear]

of topics - Ballitore - the Society of Friends - their principles - the Ballitores
of Liverpool, with whom she is acquainted - the [underline]great[/underline] Rathbone
as she emphatically called the late Wm Rathbone - the African
Slave Trade - Politics - Ballitore again, literature &c &c
[unclear][/unclear] She introduced me to her son Thomas Graham, who is what
&c - She introduced me to her son Thomas Graham, who is what
they call here a Writer - somewhat the same as an Attorney
in England - & also to her [insertion]youngest[/insertion] daughter, a fine, intelligent-looking
little girl, about the age of Hannah White - she told me a great
deal about her family - of her daughter married to half half-pay
officer - & of her son, a physician, who is gone to India - & obtained
from me almost as many particulars about my own relations.
I really cannot attempt to describe my rapturous feelings, after I
left this home, - & had [underline]time[/underline] to [deletion]th[/deletion] reflect on the happenings which
I had been enjoying - & anticipate still greater in the position
of such a friend in addition to all whom I am already blessed
with - I often think that had this choice of my friend been
left entirely to myself - I could not possibly have selected any
so desirable as those whom the wisdom & goodness of Providence
have already chosen for me - I hope I may be [deletion]sufficiently[/deletion]
but really I shall be so much occupied this year with [deletion]my[/deletion] the preparations for my
graduation that I shall have no time for it. - Has Elizabeth returned yet from Lisburn?
I spent the evening of last first day week at George Miller's - & as soon as
I could got a convenient opportunity, drew my chair over [insertion]next[/insertion] to that of his wife
& chatted with her about Wm. & Blessing Lecky, whom she recollected very well.-
She knew thee by name very well & told me of some of thy poems which thou
sent to Blessing Lecky. She desired me to remember her very affectionately
to thee.- she said that Samuel Elby informed her of Blessing's death soon
after it took place. Please to tell thy sister Sally, [insertion]with my love [/insertion] that I wish to take an
early opportunity of enquiring of Alexander Cruickshank about the friend mentioned
in her letter. I have been at his house several times since I came
but strangers were there,- & I could not get a convenient opportunity,- I gave
her love to George & Anne Miller - & requested the latter to give his love to John
Frazer & his wife, which she promised to do
I hope Deborah continues better,- please give my love to her & acknowledgements

grateful for as many [unclear]uninvited[/unclear] favours
Now that I have unburdened my mind of what was uppermost
in it, I shall turn to the other matters, I intend, however, to write to
Theodore to thank him for his kindness -
You have I suppose long since been informed of my arrival by
means of a Scotsman which I sent to Lydia two days after, - not that
my arrival was announced in the paper itself - but by my handwriting
on the [unclear]er[/unclear].- Since I saw you,- I spent a most delightful week at
my uncle Dawson's - my aunt was exceedingly gratified with
thy annals; - I would be extremely obliged,- if thou has
no objection to send her the two former volumes through some
no objection to send her the two former volumes through time
safe hand - I suppose Elizabeth has informed thee of my seeing her
in Lisburn, - I wish I could have remained longer there, but my
aunt Dawson's kind solicitations added to the strong attraction of her
& my cousin's society - tempted me to give them as much time as
I could well spare & consequently abridged my visit at Lisburn.
I was very much gratified with the very little which I saw
of John Hancock's family - I would gladly have stopped to see
more if I could,- [insertion]&[/insertion] have conversed more with John [deletion]Him[/deletion] himself - as
well as with Betsey - (a fine girl - but 'tis a great pity she's so dressy) -
& with Mary Wm's wife,- who is a most charming woman - -
judgements for her kind letter, which I intend to answer in due time
To Lydia also my thanks are due for her short letter "on such a wee sheet"
as she says herself,- but in this "wee sheet" - she promises to begin another immediately
on one of her Brobdignagian sheets;- now when I receive this Brobdignagian
sheet, - I intend to write to her.. The "wee sheet" - contains also sundry other promises,
respecting Latin translations - I hope she will be punctual in fulfilling
her 'engagements." - Sarah's little communication, although but a scrap, was also acceptable.-
Among the letters which arrived during my absence was also one from
Jacob Harvey dated the 7th of 9th month - It contains nothing however very particular.-
Elizabeth Dell from Essex & Lydia Sutton from Carlisle, both ministering friends
are here at present,- they both recollected thy sister Sally, & were enquiring about her.
I had a very acceptable religious visit from them yesterday week.
I suppose thou has heard of the precarious state of health in which my grand father is
at present; - he was seized some weeks ago with an apoplectic attack & continues still in
a weak, [unclear][/unclear] state.- My father's family intend [deletion]have[/deletion] remov[deletion]ed[/deletion]ing to his house in the country
in consequence.- Either my father, uncle James, or my brother is constantly with him.

think of sending a [underline]note[/underline] by post, & that I do not except an opportunity to Ireland
soon, - I hope she will [underline]earn a letter[/underline] soon by writing one,- As she wished to hear
how I liked Mrs. Grahame, thou mayest show her this,- Betsey, I suppose, has altogether
forsaken me. I have lately removed my lodging to Alexander Forbes's
10 St. Patrick's square, to which please to direct your letters.- Accept my love for thy family as well as for all my other friends in Ballitore.- Thy affect friend
family as well as for all my other friends in Ballitore.- Thy affecte. friend
10 St. Patrick's- square 10 of 11 Mo. 1821.-

The disturbances in the Co. Limerick appear to be assuming a most alarming
appearance. Alas ! - Government must do more for Ireland than send over a royal drunkard to drink her health in whiskey punch- the evils which
a royal drunkard to drink her health in whiskey punch - the evils which
afflict the country are radical, & require a [underline]radical[/underline] cure.
Please to give my love to Mary Shackleton, & tell her that, as I could not
