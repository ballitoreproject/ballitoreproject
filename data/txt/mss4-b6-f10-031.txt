Carlow 6th Sepr 1816
My dear friend,
I blame myself for not having address'd myself
to thee (somewhat in this way) many weeks or months
ago - more especially as the recollection of thy feeling communications
[insertion]to me[/insertion] on a similar occasion during the illness of
my dear deceased son as well as on many other trying
circumstances in my family - but well knowing the goodness
of thy heart & thy readiness to forgive even un-intended neglect
wch. indeed my dear friend has been very far from my intention
but proceeded merely from a growing disposition
to procrastinate - however I have now resolved to delay no
longer in expressing mine & my wifes near sympathy with
thee & our friends in Ballitore under your present &
late afflictions - when last with you I felt my heart unusually
attached to Dear Deborah & if I may presume
to express my sentiments - they were come life come death
this dear innocent child will be happy whatmore
can her nearest connections wish for, to dispute the decrees
of omnipotence woud be injurious - his ways indeed
are as a great deep & beyond our finite comprehensions
to unfold - Let us therefore my dear friend endeavour sincerely
to adopt the language of our holy patterns not mine x
My dear friend

but thy will be done, thou gavest & when thou seeest meet
to take away - I will in all things when aided by thy power
give thanks - The foregoing may appear as if I had given up
all hope - yet that is not the case while life remains we
[insertion]are[/insertion] willing to cling to this anchor of the soul and it has often
happened that our most gloomy apprehensions have
been succeeded by the recovery of what appeared to us lost
I have read somewhere of a female who had frequently undergone
the operation of [unclear]taping[unclear][/unclear] & yet survived 20 or 30 years
I am glad to hear Deborah bore the operation so well
we have had frequent accts of her situation wch. made
me more easy in not writing to thee - indeed I do not
care to write unless I feel something to warm my heart
when this is not the case I find the work to go very
heavily on - when opportunity & inclination occurs I
Request to have even [insertion]if[/insertion] but a few lines from thy even
hand on this interesting subject. -
My wife & I paid a visit to our friends Mt Rath & Mt.-melick
last week they were generally as usual - on our
way home we spent a few hours very agreeably with our
friends Vicars's (Laura near Mt Melick) they inquired affectionately
for thy Bro: Abraham who had visited them
lately R. Vicars's wife desired me to let him know she

had lost her favourite Sparrow by the [unclear]unmercyful[/unclear] claws
of a cat - & regrets she did not proffit by his warning
to her in the case - poor woman her lamentation on the
occasion was both pittiful & laughable & perhaps this
amiable weakness even for the loss of a sparrow may be
forgiven when we reflect she has been hitherto childless
the dear creature she said used to come to her on the pillow
put its bill into her mouth & kiss her - & fled there
for protection in her absence & was murdered by the
cat in the place it expected protection &c &c &c
We visited Mary Bewley in her little cottage they all
seemed as usual poor Betsy Beale exerting herself
in the best manner she can yet I fear to little purpose
trade being so bad - her son James gone to Cork - Nancy
Shannon &c went an 1st Day to visit the [unclear]dry bones[/unclear] at
Ballynakill - I sat with them at Mt Melick wth out
(I think) either proffit or loss - some I believe were entertained
with the novelty My wife unites in Dear love
to thee & family Ebenezar & Dear Deborah &c &c
Thy very Affectionate friend
