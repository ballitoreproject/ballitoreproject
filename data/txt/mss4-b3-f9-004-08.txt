From Richard Shackleton to Joseph Jacob

Ballitore: 19/3 month 1775

Dear Cousin,
++++ Submit we must: our lives, the lives of all we hold dear to us, & every comfort we extract from every thing are in the hand of Omnipotence, & under his control. How awfully should we then walk before him who is the source of every blessing to his depending children, & who on the other hand (as a certain author most beautifully remarks) can disquiet the soul, & vex it in all its faculties. I have been led very lately to ponder a good deal on the uncertainty of our tranquillity, & the necessity of the mediation & interposition of that great Power, to preserve us alive in every respect. Doubtless, whatever may be our trials, or from whatever quarter they may come, if we watch steadily unto prayer, if we keep a conscience void of offence, if we look & lean to the Lord for succour, we shall be helped through one difficulty, & one exercise after another, till our measure of suffering is filled up, & our weary spirits are admitted into that holy rest prepared for those who through Faith have overcome in this dangerous warfare.
+++	I am, dear Joseph, affectionately thine
		Richard Shackleton
