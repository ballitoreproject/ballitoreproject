My dear Elizth
I found Margt much as I last left her
very thin & very weak but I hope she will recruit
with fine weather & care the latter has not been
wanting as I believe every one engaged about her
did their best for her she has been taking asses'
milk & I hope will soon take the quinine but the
Doctor [deletion]S[/deletion] did not call since my return & I am unwilling
to give her [unclear]part[/unclear] medicine till I see him,
Willy alarm'd me a good deal he is greatly
[unclear]reduced[/unclear] in [deletion]age[/deletion] his flesh & has no appetite
[unclear][/unclear] tongue extremely foul he coughs a good [unclear][/unclear]
as it was & as for poor little[unclear]Nezen[/unclear] it is melancholy
to hear him thro' the night however if there
is any faith in J B's remedy he is to have it
immediately, tell Abby I am much obliged for
the belt I had forgotten it in my hurry, tell
Richd that I would not do any thing about taking
the piece of ground he spoke of without consulting
Eben as I do not see that it is quite necessary
to the Inn

Martha is leaving us I wish I had a good trusty clever girl for
Britain [unclear]street[/unclear] if and should come in thy Deborah's or Abby
Wrights way let me know, I said nothing as yet about
moving Margt either to town or country as any alteration
proposed is set down as finding fault with old
[unclear]memories[/unclear], I will attend to thy commission about Harriet
measures, I will attend to thy commission about Harriet
I believe she is in the country at present I thought it
would be an elegant plan even before thou mention'd it
her society wd be so desirable, did I tell thee Eben's
to Martha Wright as I could not find his direction
I hope to hear from you all soon, how is poor [unclear]little[/unclear] Johnny?
Elizth Leadbeater
Ballitore
I mean to send thy [unclear][/unclear] as I can
plan for my aunt Sally; I sent thy letter to T K inclosed
ever thy SB
