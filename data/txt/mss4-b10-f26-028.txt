My dearest Mother
It was delightful to receive
Elzth. letter here yesterday on our arrival
telling us of the welfare of our dear home
circle - we were also glad to find by it
that our letters had reached you for we
were somewhat in doubt about them
[deletion]as[/deletion] the last particularly as it had been posted
from [deletion]an[/deletion] a town of small import altho
a post town - Since those to Elzth. were written
I wrote to Martha from Geneva wh I hope you
have received ere this - when I posted it I thought
we should have left Geneva next day but
Thos. took ill very soon after it was in the
office wh alarmed us very much, needlessly
as it proved but as he was in bed one whole
day & part of two other we were of course
delayed - I do not know well what caused
his illness but suppose it was something
he ate -- it was not like Cholera but still
he [unclear]ate[/unclear] -- it was not like Cholera but still
it made me very uneasy whilst it lasted

& you may be sure I longed to be at home [deletion]but[/deletion]
and very thankful we happened not to be
travelling or we should have had to stop on
the road he was so sick, faint & one night
very feverish - however staying in bed and
perfect quiet (his usual remedy) soon
restored him & I am happy to say he is now
himself again - we had expected a letter
from the Doctor at Geneva wh at first made
us stop there at all more than the one
day - but we had to leave after all without
it & it followed us here - but we got it too
late to accede to any of his plans & we return
home without seeing him - We left Geneva
on Friday morning in a Carriage by which
we were to arrive in Lausanne early in
the evening but the horses were tired and
we travelled very slowly & did not get to
our journeys end until bed time and
with some difficulty got beds - every place
being full brim full of English - we had
here to engage another Voiturier - and happened
on a return carriage to Bale wh engaged to
bring us here in three days - we had a fine
roomy vehicle 3 good horses & a smart
little Vetturino (for he was an Italian [insertion]by birth I believe[/insertion] but
he spoke the funniest mixture of French
Italian & German so that it was almost by
[underline]signs[/underline] after all that we made ourselves
intelligible to each other even with all Kate
Roberts cleverness - We had a very fine day
& clear mountains from Geneva to Lausanne
& the road being almost all along the edge
of the Lake it was delightful - where we
stopped to rest the Horses & dine ourselves
there were Baths & Emy Kate & Georgie
bathed in the Lake & I took a warm
bath all of wh were exceedingly refreshing
we left Lausanne about 9 on Saturday morn
& so had not much time for seeing the town
but I saw Gibbon's House & the outside of the
Cathedral & the [underline]best[/underline] parts of the town - we got
to Fribourg that night about 1/2 past 8 and
went to bed almost immediately - the next
morning we got up to see the two Suspension
Bridges before breakfast - but as it was Sunday
we could not hear [underline]the Organ[/underline] - as it would
not play during service or until 11 oclock
& we could not wait for it - the country
through wh we had to pass was tame in
comparison to what we had seen but still

in richness & comfort & verdure it was
beautiful -- on Sunday we stopt to rest
the horses at Berne a very nice & picturesque
town where we had [insertion]nearly[/insertion] three hours to walk
about & dine - we went to the ramparts
from wh there is a fine view of the Snowy
mountains if the weather had been favorable
but tho' it was hot & sunny the clouds
hung so low round the horizon that it was
only here & there we could see a peak to tell
us they were there at all - this was very
tantalizing as it was to be our last look at
them I might say - however after we left
Berne the clouds cleared away more & we
saw five or six peaks at a time - it was
nearly dark when we got to Soleure where
we slept on Sunday night - It being Sunday
we had the advantage of seeing the people
"dressed in their best" - the costume at Berne
is very pretty & curious - & the streets were
quite alive with the people walking about
the shops were not so generally open as in
most other continental towns - except Cigar
shops & cake shops I think all were shut
I mean at Berne for [insertion]at[/insertion] Soleure it was late when we arrived
