My Lord
At the desire of Mrs. Leadbeater, I take the Liberty of
enclosing your Grace the last Publication The Landlords Friend
This Lady has met with much Success for years in sundry
Publications. The Effusions from her Pen are chiefly guided
by morality, and an anxious desire to better the Conditions of the
labouring Poor
May that Providence, that has made you Great, fill
your heart with Benevolence is the fervent wish of your devoted
Servt. T J K
