14th..- Went to meeting with Margt. after
which went out to the Glasneven gardens
with Aunt Eliza who brought us out in
Paddy Monaghan's car. The gardens
looked beautiful, but the greenhouses
surpassed all - Oh such lovely flowers!
One might spend days looking at.
I saw there several shrubs and trees, mentioned
by Doctor Hooker in his travels to the H[deletion]y[/deletion]imalay.
The rhododendrons were in brilliant
blossom. The plantains looked like
giant sword ferns. Uncle T and
Aunt C were to go down to Dunlaoire.
Florence has gone. Papa went out
this evening.
