My dear Sally, Mt.mellick 30.th of 8mo. 1790.
It was kind of thee & I admire thy freedom,
[deletion][/deletion] [insertion]in thus[/insertion] communicating
thy sentiments so frankly & openly, tho', I must confess,
I was a good deal hurt too, for thou hast
mistaken me; however I shall endeavour to
make thy mind easy respecting that part
of my letter which I fear has given thee some
uneasiness, & still, I believe, if thou knew but
all thou would excuse me ~ Why my dear
friend when I considered how undeserving &
unworthy I was of such a person, such connexions,
I wondered at my assurance; for what
pretensions could I have, what way was I
in to support a wife, what place had I to bring
her to? & I am far from being a strong healthy
man, so that these weighed with me, & were
my reasons for those strange expressions:
now wilt thou excuse me, for this is the
truth? And that [underline]one reason[/underline] which thou wished
so much to know was this. I had got some encouragement,
(but it was not from any of your family),
& I was [underline]then[/underline] willing to make it an excuse
for

for what I had done (but that was cowardly)
for I dreaded the issue least, by a hasty
imprudent slip, I had thrown myself
entirely from that I had so long waited on
as well as wished for; but now these are
removed, & I hope & believe the time is come
for it to go forward, [insertion]so[/insertion] do thou act [insertion]for me[/insertion] accordingly
if thou please, & do forgive me for I expect
to behave better in future ~
I don't want [insertion] at all[/insertion] to be held in competition
with [insertion] dear [/insertion] J: Clibborn [insertion] for [/insertion] I know right well there
is a vast difference, save in that respect
thou hinted at, & in that I think I am
not [underline]much[/underline] his inferior tho' , [insertion]perhaps[/insertion] I don't shew
it so much, neither did I want to be told
that the object in question was [underline]well[/underline] deserving
my attachment for I was & I am [underline]well[/underline]
convinced of it. Shall I hear from thee
again? Do write if it be but two or three
lines. Thy last I only rec.d yesterday it
lay in this Post Office since last 4th day
till then the Post-master not knowing remembering

remembering [insertion]I believe[/insertion] that Mary Pim lived
at the Pro: School, farewell
I believe
dearly thine
