Dear Molly
Dublin 27th. 12 mo 1775
I am loath to let slip so favourable an
opportunity, of writing to my Dr friend; tho I cant
say but thou art still remiss in this point to me; if thee
has waited for a opportunity, that I think is not
sufficient; as there is a very speedy conveyance by post
 for with the greatest pleasure wou'd I have paid for
it, well I am still willing to apolagise for thee, as
to be sure I know not what might hinder, but allowi[insertion]ng[/insertion]
there was hinderances, sure thee might allow one hour
to gratifie me; & I cou'd wish that friendship, & esteem
might be between us, which wou'd encourage us to
keep up a [insertion]mutual[/insertion] correspondence, arriseing from real regard:
which I hope we have for each other, I am often very
busy myself,& perhaps at the time when I think it's
my duty, to return my friends favours; but however
I refer some of these obstructions, till after I have
clear'd myself; in hopes to pull it up another times
and am often glad that we have, these opportunity
of communicating our sentaments to each other, when
it's not in our power to appear in person; sertainly

this was a good institution, from the first, as it ineab[insertion]les[/insertion]
us to keep up [deletion]a[/deletion] friendships, which might have been desolv'd
by time & absence; which might be to our advantage
and indeed, many are the good institutions there is among us
& many improving oppertunitys we miss, by not timely
taking heed; well my Dr.; I hope thee wont disappoint me, as
I expect a long letter in return; I dont know yet who may
convey this to thee, I did intend that Jenny Beale wou'd, be so
kind, but she being indisposed with a cold [deletion][/deletion] [insertion]wont go, she[/insertion] has kept her
bed, these 3 days, & rather feverish but suppose is now some
what better, E Pike, cant say whether she can leave her yet, but
rather think she wont. I suppose thee had heard of Barthy
Clibbourn. Daughters illness, as Joss here, she's been far
gone in a Consumption, her life is this some time dispair'd
off; but still holds out to admiration; she being
so weak scarce able to help herself, & worn so thin that
one wou'd not immagin she cou'd exist a day more; tho
no sign of so speedy a removal, as no persavable alteration
these some days, tho sertainly she must be weaker -
at the begining, she was not sensable of this been her
and, (which was the affects of cold, tho not in a healthfull
state before,) but now being quite sensable, she wont recover,
she is resign'd to the will of the Almighty; she had
a visit from James Gough, by her own desire; which was
of satisfaction to both, he said she was in a sweet fraim
of mind, & he belived wou'd be very happy, which was
no doubt to her Parents, a great comfort, tho her loss may
be great & afflicting to them: I hope it may be to her
everlasting gain - I was a few days agoe informd, that

Thomas Strangman, has lost his Daughter Nancy, her
complaint was this epidemical cold, which I suppose fell
on her lo[insertion]u[/insertion]ngs, in which a Nervous Fever insued, that took
her off: her Parants for her loss is almost inconsalable
& indeed no doubt, so much troubles they have had even since
the removed to Waterford, its not over 7 mo since the buri[insertion]ed[/insertion]
their Eldest; poor people, the are much to be pitty'd -
many have been taken off, since the begining of this cold
how my Dr: have you ascaped, perhaps thee has been confind;
our family all had it but rather slight, & true
Mercy are all well, except sister Fanny who still complain
it has been universal, I think almost in Town & Country-
This evening I am going to see Cousin Jenny White,
who I suppose thee has heard was second day, was 3 weeks
brought to bed of a fine girl, & is now pritty well its
Name is Maryann - Give my love to thy [insertion]Aunt &[/insertion] Sisters, Debby,
Peggy; & besure Sally: Please tell Debby, I send her the gloves
she gave me to get dye'd not knowing who the belong'd
to in Mt Melick, I thought I'd best send them to her who
gave them to me; hoping the may please her, & the person
there for; E Pike, told me she got orders to pay me for
geting them done, which I got done for nothing, by
one of our dyers, I also send Sally, the pattern of the
Cap, having got it from a friend, as at the Poor house
the had none but the common sort, which I suppose
she is not a stranger too, I have procured two [deletion][/deletion]
different cuts, supposing one of them to be the one she
wants, - now my Dr:, having disclosed to thee, some

of my sentaments, I must draw nigh a conclusion
& am in great haist, with assuring thee
my Dr: I am & hope ever to continue, thy sincere friend
and corrispondant,
Sarah Simmons,
N : B
my Mothers love to thee, in which she wou'd be
obliged to thee to procure her, a copy of a letter which
thy Father has in his possession; of Mary Brooks's,
writing, which was I suppose to a couple in England,
she cant exactly, remember their [deletion]Names[/deletion] Names * but
thinks by the above thou may understand it as no
doubt but thou has seen it,
