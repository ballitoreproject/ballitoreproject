Richard Shackleton							  London 6 month 14th 1772
Dear Cousin!

	By this thou will see that the close engagements even of a Yearly-meeting Week do not prevent my attention to and Acknowledgement of thy acceptable Favour, duly received; thy Remembrance of me is very kind, & thy well-timed gentle Caution, I think, hath not been without its Service; thy pertinent Reflections on the surrounding Temptations & Dangers that await even the most vigilant, I wish still to keep in view, hoping to derive further Benefit Therefrom, being well assured that a Dependant watchful State is the safest.
	Did anything of value offer in return, & had I time & Talents, it would yield me pleasure to convey it; I have often wished to be better qualified, were it only for my Friends sake -- Perhaps thou wilt reply that the Meeting itself hath surely afforded matter sufficient for a long Epistle, I acknowledge it hath for more than one, & I hope the Friends from Ireland will be careful to take them over, that they may conduce to your Comfort & Edification, yours especially, that have staid by the Stuff; if ye have been faithful ye are certainly entitled to the Promise: But did not these Epistles so amply supply my Defect, in answering thy Request, these Friends are well qualified, & a circumstantial account, viva voce, must yield a Satisfaction so much superiour, that an attempt to anticipate, tho weak, would seem unkind; for these weighty reasons I trust thou will readily excuse my silence on this head; besides, I have another Matter in agitation at present, that hangs rather heavier on me than my Cloaths [sic]--^tho the weather is warm^ thou probably wilt hear of it, as Joseph or Jacob will be of the Council ^now^ about to be called, wherein should any weighty Objections arise I hope to be passive, Peace generally accompanies a proper Submition [sic] to the Advice of wise & experienced Friends, yet according to my apprehension we have few amongst us that travel deeper [words crossed out] in search of, & more closely attend to the Pointings, Counsel & Direction of Unerring Wisdom, in their steppings along, than our worthy well esteemed William Hunt, with whom I seem in degree united in an Engagement which he left to my Consideration when we parted soon after our landing from Ireland, and I have, as I think, duly considered it, so that be the result of the Consultation what it may, unless, as before observed, some weighty Objections arise, I shall endeavour to keep to my own feelings & apprehensions of Duty therein, provided that Williams Concurrence & unity still remain.
	Joseph Garrett & Richard Pike, innocent Youth, kept with William & Thomas til they reached London, I turned homewards pretty Directly from Liverpool, & Sally Hall to Skipton, I left her well; the Letters for her & her Sister Dale shall be forwarded with Care: I am informed by Letter from John Hustler that thy Relation M. Fletcher got safe to Idle; he will assist in securing the Money, which when on Board, for the greater safety there & on the Road I prevailed with her to give up, & since desired him to repay; she being sickly on the passage we accommodated her with a Place in the Cabin, & with all other Necessaries, such as she was able to use, at least equal with the rest of us.
	I have been several times at Richard Burkes Lodgings, now in Cecil Street, & he also had the trouble of calling once at mine, we at length met, but had very little opportunity for Conversation, Meeting-time intervening; however he treated me however with great Civility, enquired kindly after thee & thy Family for whom he expressed a great Regard, & proposed to get me Franks; I accepted the Proposal & am obliged to thee as well as him for it; I have not yet had time to call on the two Members.
	I cannot recollect much of News at present, save that at the conclusion of the Business yesterday, we were favoured with some Expressions dropt [sic] by Samuel Fothergill & transmitted as a kind of farewell message to the Yearly-meeting; that great Apostle & worthy seems to be hastening fast to the End of his Course in full assurance of the Reward of Peace; I saw him on my way up; his Expressions were very affecting, they brought a great Solemnity over the Meeting; which on the whole hath been a favoured one & thro Mercy ended well. I desire to be often affectionately remembered by thee, & the whole of thy amiable Family, as such I truly esteem you all, thyself, thy Wife, thy Son & every Daughter, not forgetting the least, I so remember you, I conclude, with desires also to hear from you as occasion with Freedom may prompt.
	My assured Friend
