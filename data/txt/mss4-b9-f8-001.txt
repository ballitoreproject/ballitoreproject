My dear Emily
Untill yesterday from
your Uncle Sethum, I had
heard nothing either directly
or indirectly from your
Aunt or Uncle since they
left Ireland you may
guess therefore with
what interest I read
tho letters from your
Aunt which you sent
me to day. I now
return them with many
thanks for your so kindly
thinking of me.
Your Aunt H B and I were
fully expecting your mother
would have been able

to pay us a visit here
before she returned to
Dunlavin and that
the errcel I have bought
your sister with her.
It is years I believe
since she was here and
we thought if she could
be prevailed on to stay
with us for 2 or 3 weeks,
the change of air & scene
might have had, perhaps
a permanent effect upon
health. Give my Love
to her & thee her  [unclear] unknown [/unclear]
she feels inclined to come
we shall be glad, very
glad to make her welcome
Your Father also is [unclear]under[/unclear]
Your Father also is [unclear][/unclear]
a sort of promise to pay
us a visit, but he has not
come near us the whole
Summer. Them
having taken of their abode
at Healle Richmond in Paris
makes me feel easier
than I should at the [unclear][/unclear] he
when I think of yours
Uncle & Aunt being so
far away by themselves.
The Ladies who keep the
House, can both speak
English well & were very
agreeable & kind to us when
we were with them, I
remain Dear Emily
