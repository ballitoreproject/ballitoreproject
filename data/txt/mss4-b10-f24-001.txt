Dresden 1st May 1847
My dear Mrs Barrington
I was greatly gratified
by the receipt of your kind letter by Eliza
& should have acknowledged it long ago
but while Thomas & Eliza were here I was
kept in a constant fuss & perpetual motion
& could not settle my mind to write
to any one. This morning Eliza &
Thomas & Mary have left us & very
lonely we will feel after them, I am
very sorry to find they have such a
day, heavy thunder showers, incessantly
since 10 o'clock, my brother James
leaves Dresden in about a fortnight & I
dare say we will not remain long behind
& perhaps before the summer is over
I may have the great pleasure of seeing
my dear friends in Ireland. I think we

will leave this the beginning of June
for England & I hope we will not be long
in England without visiting Ireland.
I am afraid I will feel the want of Mary
very much it is the only drawback I feel
to my happiness. that I must be so much
separated from her, neither she nor I
are much improved in health or appearance
by our travels I have felt little
or no rheumatism since I left home
but my stomach still gives me as much
trouble as ever. W Evans was looking
very poorly when I first met him
on the continent he is greatly improved
& though he certainly looks much older
than when you saw him yet I think he
looks in better health & his spirits are
very good. you will I hope see our
friends who left us this morning almost
as soon as you will receive this
letter, they will tell you all particulars
about us & about their journey & their
little adventures & also about James's
beard after which you enquire so particularly,
it is certainly very disfiguring
I am sure you would be very
sorry to see him with it, though it
does not inconvenience him when
eating neither is it parted on the
upper lip, I believe it never grows
so long as to be in the way.
I am truly sorry to hear that poor Richard
is so delicate I very much fear for
him & cannot bear to think of his
sorely tried Father, one who feels so
keenly & has already suffered so much.
We have had here a very backward spring
& with you I believe it has not been
much better, it is not long since we
had heavy snow & when Thomas & Eliza

were on their trip to Vienna it snowed
incessantly for 36 hours, I dare say they
wrote to you all about it. Wm. has
just gone into town to see after the model
& I expect him back shortly to dinner
it will be a solitary meal today, I
did not feel it when they were absent
on their trip, as I expected them back
but when they are gone not to return it is
quite another thing. I will be very anxious
to hear of the safe arrival of
the three travellers in poor old Ireland
now poorer than ever & always I fear
doomed to poverty.
Give my kindest love to Mrs Fayle &
& tell Manliff I hope he will follow
my good example I recommend it
to him highly. & believe me ever
in whatever land & in whatever state

to be your sincerely attached friend

name instead of my new one it is the first
time I made this mistake & I boasted yesterday
