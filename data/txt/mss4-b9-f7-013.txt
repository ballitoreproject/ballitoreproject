My dear Elizabeth
You are Welcome home.
I hope you found all right on your
return. I have had two notes
from H Williams about some person
who wants to get the House next
door to him, which by the by I thought was
occupied, but suppose I overlooked it
when with you last. I do not know
even the name of the Person he [unclear][/unclear] this house
mind and as I do not either well [unclear][/unclear]
would you have the goodness to enquire
about him and if you think him
likely to be a good tenant and that 3/0
a week is a fair and proportionate
rent for it, make an agreement with him
to pay weekly the rent to you and give him
possession, but if you do not like [unclear][/unclear]
as enquiry, better leave the forms
empty

I wish I could throw any light on the
Earl H concern, but untill I can
her the title deeds I am completely
in the dark. I agree with you that
Mr Palen should get the rent from
Yours. I remain your affectionate E B
([underline]post paid[/underline])
