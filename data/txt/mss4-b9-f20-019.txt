1st mo 1828
My dear E - Excuse this shabby
scrap: thine arrived this eve
for which many thanks I think
thou hast got a troublesome
[underline]Agency [/underline] thou ought to be well paid
the beds, thou knows thy self what
to charge for, I intend getting the
one I have [unclear][/unclear]'d the other was
much smaller I believe I ought
to leave it till thou hast money,
enough of mine to pay for them
as Edw is paying for all the other
things, our hopes are a little relieved
about Emily tho' very little
she was taken into the open air
which seem'd to have a good effect
on her her pulse fell many degrees
this is new years day
I dont wonder at this time
reviving many recollections
I was going to say painful
but they are not so
it is only
painful
to think

that the same enjoyments
are never to occur again
22..- ,,
this is painful but I think
there is great pleasure
in looking back to former times
& dwelling upon the good qualities
of our precious parents, their
memory is inexpressibly
dear & sweet, they
were most excellent -
so you had Richd at christmas
I wish I could see him here
& may be I may didnt thou
venture to Thadbally yet?
I wish thou would come to Dublin
but I suppose [unclear][/unclear] I see them at
the meeting time it is the
most I may expect
ever thy SB
