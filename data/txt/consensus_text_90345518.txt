25 Thursday - we had Papa's welcome

He read Waverly to us in the evening
but not much of it. Oh I
wish he could oftener stay out
and yet we dont [underline]seem[/underline] to prize his

company enough, dont exert

his few leisure hours - I am
sure I dont act [underline]my[/underline] part and
yet there is no one I a have more
ardent desire to please. But there
is no use in bemoaning my stupidity
I was not born to shine and [underline]if[/underline] I only
act my humble part, cannot do more - alas!
