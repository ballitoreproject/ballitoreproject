Dear M Davis
I have been reading the
Friend about Amanda Smith
I believe her well employed
in Liberia. If it is possible
to get her to give a more
systematic account, it would
add to her usefulness.
Thus a little in this style thus
9
Jane engaged this month
at [unclear]herc[/unclear] is at Schol
remember Bug Girls
Preschool many times numbers
attending from , to the number.
The languge spoken.
As A Smith speaks of Books
I wish to know in what
Language printed .3
What are the Titles of those
mostly used & of thee New
Testament in the Liberian
Language is published in Honroria
& of any printing is done there.
 If I have satisfactory answers
I intead to send some Books to
thee I want to Know in what
language the children are taught

I dont like to give thee
extra trouble - I wish A Smith
better supported & I think
of she will give us more
information better arranged
it may help that object
I will ask thee to
accept [unclear]credored[/unclear] Four Pounds
 to be remitted to her - & if
thou canst obtain further
information as to Languages &
it may be very useful.
with Kind regards
Thine sincerely
Geo Sturge
