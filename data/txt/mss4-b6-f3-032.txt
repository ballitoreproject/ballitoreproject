To M.L. -
I suppose my dear Friend, thou will suppose I have no small
portion of vanity when I begin to write to thee, however thy kind
addition to my friend Betsy's letter has so delighted me that
I cannot help returning thee thanks for it. Thou enquires about
the writer of the ballad on Woodstock. I do not know who is the
author, as it is a very ancient ballad in this country, but it was
sent to the Magazine by a clergyman who lives near the Giants'
Causeway. In the next magazine thou will see a poem which
Rushton sent me on the recovery of his eyesight, which I think
thou will admire, and I assure thee I am quite rejoiced that he

sent it to me, as I think it is a proof of his friendship for me.
I doubt Betsy S. has said more for me than I deserve, and I fear you
will be sadly disappointed in me; I do not know when I will be
likely to go to Ballitore, for I seem to have so many things to attend
to at home, that it is often difficult for me to get abroad - My
Father will have business in Dublin this summer, and if he goes
there we will certainly go with him, and as I dislike Dublin very
much his plan will be to send Betsy & me on to Ballitore, and
when his business is finished he & the boys will follow us - However
as yet this is only building castles in the air - which is sometimes
a very pleasant amusement - I delivered thy message to [unclear]B[/unclear] He
Jane & Edmund were here lately,
but we do not see them as often
as we would wish - Excuse the
freedom of this scrawl and
believe me thy affectionate
S Hancock.
Ballitore
