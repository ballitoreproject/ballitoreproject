My dear Elizth
I recd the hamper & its contents safe except the
cream cheese which was quite spoil'd before it reach'd
me I am much obliged by my mothers good intentions
& would say nothing of the accident except to prevent
her sending again - I dont know what to say for
all the trouble I have given I did not expect to get
nearly so much jam & I did know when I would stop
taking out eggs I concluded thou fill'd the hamper
with your own eggs, I send this by [unclear]Joss[/unclear] Houghton
who I hope will leave it with the waiter at the
Inn I send [deletion]Ph[/deletion] Psyche for which Eben paid R W 3,, 1. /2
& a pair of stockings for Richd for which I paid 10s/-
let him hand it to thee - I heard but once
from Lydia since she went home, my aunt B &
Sally have return'd from Glendruid, Margaret
is out there now - I was sorry Betsy Barrington & M
White did not fulfil their promise, & call to see me
I was greatly disappointed with dear love to all I conclude thy SB
