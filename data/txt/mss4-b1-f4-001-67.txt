for thee now in the decline of life; and I trust Almighty
help and favour will be near for thy comfort and support.
Remember me affectionately to our dear S. A petition was
begot in my heart for her this day in meeting, that she may
be preserved in the training of Infinite Wisdom, and grow
to be useful in the Church of Christ, according to the extent
of the designation of her gracious Master, whose she is, and
whom I believe she serves acceptably. If she finds in her
heart to write me a line, it will, doubtless be acceptable;
but I would not have her to be uneasy if she does not, for
I shall not be uneasy on that account. I wish her never to
give to others that which is only for herself, nor to keep
unprofitably and detrimentally to herself, what may be
given to her for others. If it will be any encouragement
or satisfaction to her, I can freely say I have near unity
with her sweet effusions, and her deportment and conduct
preaches loudly (I wish I could say effectually) to me.
R. S.
