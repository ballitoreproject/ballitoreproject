light infantry (one of the finest battalions in the world) with with[insertion]out[/insertion] either recommendation,
or any personal knowledge of either my Captain, or Officers,
& with very little money, I assure you, I served the whole Campaign 1776
with the battalion, got a very slight wound in my right leg, on the
bloody 27th of August on Long-Island, was at various other places during
the whole Campaign, as we were more employed, & much more so dreaded
by our dastardly & murdering-like enemy the Rebels, than any other part
of the Army. I am very well convinced, (whether I deserved it or not, I
can't answer for) that Providence had a very great hand in me; for very
near nine months, during which time we [insertion]never[/insertion] had ten days rest together, &
in a scorching-hot country, very great fogs & cold nights, I never once slept
with my clothes off, or in a house; we used sometimes get into a barn, wch
was a very great luxury; the open heavens was our covering; heavy rains,
& most dreadful & tremend[deletion]r[/deletion]ous thunder & light[deletion]e[/deletion]ning has often frighted me
more than the roaring of cannon, & dreadful slaughter of small arms &
bayonets, during which, thank God for it, I never had an hour's illness; if
I had the Lord help me, my best retreat would have been a Military hospital,
& twenty to one my promotion stopped, as nothing ever could have promoted
me, but my being always on the spot, & my name often reaching the General's
ears among the return of men fit for duty after a skirmish, for we were
always in hot water. My Captain, whose name was Knight (43d (light
company) regiment,) at last began to like me very well, after trying me
for a campaign, & sharing the many hardships of the field together, spoke
of me to the General, who gave [deletion]me[/deletion] but little hopes - I still persevered - Capt.
Knight was in a [insertion]very[/insertion] little time appointed Aid de camp to the General (Howe) &
I was taken prisoner; & (which is very extraordinary, & never a precedent
known of the like before to a Captive), Genl. Howe gave [insertion]me[/insertion] a 2d Lieutenancy in
his own regiment (the 23d or Royal Welch Fusileers) one of the finest regiments
in the army. To tell you the hardships I suffered while I was prisoner would
be impossible, I shall retain that until I have the pleasure of seeing you, if ever
I am so blessed: all I shall say on that head is, that I saw the best part of
seven [deletion]part[/deletion] of the rebellious provinces, & slept in most of their jails.
I suppose you are married by this time, & has a housefull of children; if
you are, & have children, God bless you & them, & all prosperity attend you;
whoever the happy man is I wish him the same; I can't help telling you I am
not a little jealous of you, I should expect at least to hear from you on that head
