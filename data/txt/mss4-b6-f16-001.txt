Clonmel 5 mo- 29th- 1823
Dear friend
Mary Leadbeater
Meeting with an opportunity per thy nephew
RG I am inclined to make use of it to put
into thy hands 5 letters from my revered friend
thy honourable father addressed to my dear
father & to my bror Richd Jacob leaving thee
at liberty to take such extracts from them
as thou may incline, as I think they contain
some matter wch ought not to be lost
I have cause to think that what I now
send is only a part of the correspondence
wch existed for several years between the
parties & [insertion]as[/insertion] I am endeavouring to get possession
of the letters I would wish to know from thee
how long it is likely to be before the volume
thou art now compiling will be finished.
Thy dear sister Margt. Grubb is again
revived so as to get about amongst her
friends

& also to meetings [unclear]tho'[/unclear] she is still very
infirm & has a good deal the appearance
of declining old age, but retains the same
sweet, innocent, chearful disposition for
wch. she has been remarkable thro' life -
My Jane & I have frequent opportunity of
her company in her present residence wch
we esteem a priviledge. Thy dear
sisters Deborah, Lydia & Sarah are affectionately
remembered by us & we shall be obliged
when thou hast opportunity to give our
dear love to them, [insertion]also[/insertion] to thy husband, thy
daughter Elizth Betsey Shackleton & our
cousins Thos, Fanny & Lucy Bewley ~
I am affectionately thy friend
Isaac Jacob
If not too troublesome
I wd. wish to be remembered
to Doctor Davis
