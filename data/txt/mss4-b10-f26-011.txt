Dresden March 19th 1847
My dearest Mother
We arrived here last night about 1/2 past 9 oclock one
week and three hours after we left Kingstown pier! was not that quick?
we were here before our letters written to apprise thee of our [deletion]arrival[/deletion] [insertion]coming[/insertion] - my head
is in such a whirl that I can scarcely collect my thoughts to write - I wrote to
you from Liege and again from Cologne - we put the first into the office at
Liege as we were passing to the railway and did (could not) pay the postage - the
one from Cologne we gave to the waiter and money to pay for it but as that is
such a temptation to put it into his pocket you will most probably have to pay
for it too - I am not saying this by way of apology for I know I need not only to let
you know the fact - We did not stop in Cologne to see any thing - Thos. seemed so
anxious to push forward I thought it much better to do [insertion]so[/insertion] and we agreed to change
our route and instead of going by Frankfort by ourselves join with our agreeable
friends Mr Goldener & Mr Henry and [insertion]go[/insertion] post by [insertion]Minden,[/insertion] Hanover Brunswick Magdeburg
& Leipzig tho' it would be more fatiguing - we accordingly left every thing to Mr Goldener's
arrangement and started from Cologne 1/4 past six on Monday evening taking
leave of Dr Bushman there (he gave us his address and requested we should
write to him from Dresden to tell him how we got on and invited us to go see
him at Wisbaden if we should happen to pass that way) I cannot tell you
the names of all the port towns we passed at every one of which we had
to change horses and carriages - the first place we went into a house a
common little public house there was an oval table laid out in the centre of
the room with one candle on it and in the centre a cloth like our table covers [insertion]but[/insertion] small
& put corner ways so [drawing] and on it placed a little plate of sliced beef & some other
meat & black bread & brown bread & cheese & butter no drink of any kind - with
some difficulty we got cold water and that was all any of us took we did not
feel inclined for the eatables at all - at the far end of the room was another table
at wh. were [deletion]two[/deletion] men playing cards & smoking - our horses &c were soon ready and we
proceeded and so we went on until Wednesday morning day & night nothing
particular occurring sometimes we went in to the houses & sometimes not - generally
it was pleasanter to walk about in the open air than go amongst the drinkers & smokers
in one place we heard glee singing in the streets wh. put us in mind of the [unclear][/unclear]
some of our Muffling was forgotten at Minden but we wrote to the post master
about it & they say we will get it - time will tell - on Wednesday morning we
got to a place called Nendorf a watering place belonging to some petty prince

or Duke and where there is a great resort at particular seasons to drink the waters
the post master in the town is the principal person from whom fresh horses must
be taken if he have them - at this place he said he must give us three horses we having
all the rest of the way travelled with only two - Mr Goldener objected but it was no use 3
we must have & they were put to & we nearly ready to start when the payment came
to be made then the secretary (for the Master himself was not yet up) objected to take the english
sovereign for more than 17/ - this occasioned a great dispute both secretary and
Mr Goldener [insertion]were angry[/insertion] - the latter told the former it was downright swindling cheating &c
the secretary threatened to strike & indeed I almost feared he would - then the horse were
ordered back to the stable "a government officer had been insulted by being called a
ordered back to the stable a government officer had been insulted by being called a
swindler - we should have neither horses nor carriage " - we then went to another
hotel where we could get horses but then the postmaster would not give up our
luggage (which unfortunately had been for the first time on our journey brought
into the houses at all) - what was to be done - the burgomaster was applied to - they found
him cleaning his horses - he dressed himself but on his cap & coat of authority and
came down to the postmaster - that was of no avail the Postmaster being considered
highest in authority - we had therefore to apply to a higher [deletion]w[/deletion]one and had to take a
carrge & pair & set off to a court of justice - where each gentleman had to have
a seperate case made out drawn up and then these to be given to a Judge
and a regular verdict given on the case - the judge gave all in our favor
except that he thought Mr Goldener had better not have called the man a cheat
[insertion]said[/insertion] that regular law proceedings might be gone on with & that they all could have
recovered damages for the delay occasioned them on their journey wh. damages
Mr Goldener travelling by order of the British government would have laid at [insertion]Â£[/insertion] 500
p day - but the judge a very gentlemanly man indeed advised against
this said he would give an order or even come with us himself to have our
luggage given up to us Mr Goldener acknowledging that he was angry when he applied
the offensive epithet - we went to another Hotel and took Lunch but had to
take the horses & carriage after all from the post master as those we were to have
had from the Burgomaster were hired by the postmaster for us to go to the court of
justice & were too tired to go on to Hanover - it all ended very well except that
we should have been at our journey, and nearly a day sooner only for it - It was
quite an adventure and offered us some amusement afterwards - still I think
if Mr Goldener finds he has suffered by the delay he will not let it rest here
We got to Hanover a nice lively clean looking town in time for the four oclock
train to Brunswick - I should have liked very much to have stopped a while in
Hanover every thing looked so gay - the Station house & waiting rooms are splendid
the Ladies waiting room particularly is exceedingly elegant - the second class carriages equal
to our first or nearly so - the people very polite and the officers at railroad also we were
not at all annoyed by smoking - when we said we did not like smoking they put
us into carriages by ourselves and afterwards admitted no gentleman without

letting them know they were not to smoke - We got on pleasantly to Brunswick
against six oclock - dined at Table. [unclear][/unclear] had very good bedroom & beds - had tea also and
went to bed right willingly after travelling three days & two nights without ceasing or
lying down - we got some sleep in the carriages between times but not a great deal - Brunswick
is a very curious town but we had not time to see much of it - We left it by Railway
at 1/2 past seven on Thursday morning Thos. & I for Dresden Mr Goldener & Mr Henry for
Berlin we were as far as Magdeburgh together we there parted company I think with
mutual regret, we exchanged cards (amicably though) and gave each other invitations
to our homes if we chanced to be in the way of each other in future and separately perhaps
never to meet again - We felt very lonely after them & Thos. I think felt it very much
more so perhaps because we were really fatigued with the quick travelling &c.. We
got to Leipzig a little after three fortunately met a very nice waiter belonging to the Dresden
railway Hotel quite a young man but he could speak English a little wh. with the little
German Thos. knows enabled us to get on very well we ordered dinner, and took
it at the public table (veal cutlets Potatoes & bread all most excellent & nicely cooked)
the waiter then told us we might go walk in the park as the train would not start [unclear]until[/unclear]
five oclock we did so and [insertion]saw[/insertion] great numbers of people walking & driving, the avenues in
the park quite alive with children & their nurses & maids basking in the Sun so lively
and merry looking it was quite pleasant to see them; with almost every group
there was a wicker work carriage on four wheels with nice
heads to [deletion][/deletion] in wh. the youngest child was sitting or
lying covered with a down quilt - the young nursery Maids in
their hair wh. is always nicely done up - the older one had a kind of
cap or hood - the Ladies wore warm wadded cloaks but mostly light
summer bonnets - they do not appear to us to be as cold at all well they were much more warmly
clad than we would have been at home in such weather - it is and has been most beautiful
weather ever since we came to the continent frost every night [unclear]but[/unclear] bright clear starlight
the days brilliant sunshine without a cloud to be seen - would have been too hot for exercise
had there not been also a pleasant breeze - we every day saw the snow lying in heaps here &
there in sheltered places - the ice still on the water every where when deep enough to have been
frozen to any great depth - the large rivers not quite free from ice either the Elbe is only just
open - yesterday we saw snow 8 or 10 feet deep in some places - We arrived here before
our letters as I told you so that we took the Girls quite by surprise it was to their Hotel we came
(James in private Lodging, & [deletion]was[/deletion] [insertion]had[/insertion] just left Bessie & Mary) We almost put Bessie into hysterics - they
were you may be sure rejoiced to see us - we got supper our room was soon prepared but
there was so much to be said on all sides that we did not go to bed early - it was too late to see
James last night so Mary got up early & went off this morning before we were up, to tell him
we were come & bring him here - Mary breakfasted with him & then they both came over and
caught us at breakfast - James has a frightful beard (he made me kiss him twice for all that)
he looks much older owing to that I think - we are to go over to him to tea and to see A J & Catharine
we have dined here and are writing before we go out - (Thomas has been out & in again)
I am now longing to hear from you all it seems very long since we parted we have seen
such variety - and the weather so delightful - still were the sun does not shine it is
very cold - I every day regret Emy's not being with us - had I at all anticipated such weather

I would have had a deal more courage to take charge of her - if her cold had been well & that she
were as well as usual it would have done her a deal of good - but we could not have travelled at
the rate we did she would not have been at all able for that nor would we have done so had
she been with us - It is I imagine far pleasanter here now than in the height of Summer
because you have the advantage of the warm sun without the Sultriness - I must
now conclude as all are waiting for me to go out - I will not write to any one else
at present so you might send this to any one that wd. care to see it - I would
[unclear]like[/unclear] Lucy to see it - if I were to write separately to every one I would do nothing else
I hope you have this fine weather at home if so everything will look gay soon.
Here the Gardens have nothing whatever in them except perhaps a little box edging, but
in many places they were working at them we saw very little farm work doing as we
[insertion]came[/insertion] along - but we saw great numbers of persons working at railroads - the Windows in
many places are filled with Flowers - Hyacinths tulips Camellias &c. small Laurestinus
in pots is another common thing also a small kind of Lilac - In hopes of soon hearing from
home and that all are well and with very dear love to all [insertion]in which Thos bids me join him[/insertion] I am my dear Mother
Your affectionate daughter
EH
Bessie & Mary look very well I think
Be sure you mention every one when you write
or Elizth. will do so for I am sure she knows how interesting the merest trifles are to those away from
home

Please tell
Maniff
to remember
the cockles -
Eliza has
monopolized
all the news
so I can only
say
I am very
affectionately
Mrs Edith Henry
