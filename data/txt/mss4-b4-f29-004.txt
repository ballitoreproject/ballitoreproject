Ballitore 7th of 2nd mo 1808
My dear Aunt
True enough it was a
queer way I took to make thee answer
my letter, signs on it thou
did not mind me. I write this
without any hopes of an answer
short or long, but endeed I [insertion]rather[/insertion] see that
-self than a letter, My Mother
stay'd three days out, Sarah was
with her, they went to Mountmelick
& saw my dear Sister Elizabeth
I am obliged to Mary Haughton
for her love, please give her mine, I
got a letter from my Aunt Chandlee
I am mighty sorry my poor Uncle is
so ill, he used to be so pleasant & gay
when I was in Athy he used to
carry me on his back about the
house, when I saw him after there
was a great change. I am longing
till Lydia White has a Child, en[unclear][/unclear]
one's afraid of doing some mischief by

her. Give my love to The faintly
smiling Maid, she wont be always
faintly smiling [insertion]I hope[/insertion], I suppose thou knows
who I mean. I went to Thomas
Glassbrook's for a loaf this morning
they were not up but a man (who
I soon knew was [insertion]a[/insertion] Preacher) came in,
he said it was a pity I should sin
on a Sabbath, now let us reason on
it said he, I was going to run
off but I thought [underline]worse[/underline] of it after,
he ask'd me, had not He that made
me, the best right todo with me, he
said it so often, that at last I said I
believed so, you think so said he, I
said nothing, he continued, He desires
that you should not only Resist from
sin on a sabbath, but from all corporeal
labour, for the first time
I ventured a look at him, I was
sorry after for I not only [underline]faintly[/underline]
[underline]smil'd[/underline] but almost laugh'd, he
said something more which I dont

remember, [deletion][/deletion] he then walk'd over
to the fire to settle his watch by
one that hung over the Chimney
piece, I took the opportunity & gave
him the slip thou has all the
particulars, [insertion]of my adventure[/insertion] as thou may plainly
perceive, now I think as he was
advising me to desist from sin
on the sabbath, he might as
well put in for me to resist
form sin the whole week, bu
as I fear thou will be tir'd of [unclear][/unclear]
these desistings, I had better desist
from writing any more about it
My Mother Mary and Anne
& Richard Sarah and Lydia all
join in love to, Richard has
fine fun gathering eggs, Sarah
and Lydia are employ'd with
their babys, & me thy humble
servand. (as Mconnaky says)
writing to thee. Molly Webster
got her house whitewash'd it is
greatly improved, Jos is very gay, &

cracks a great deal of jokes with Lydia
Molly is gay too. "Will to be sure"
said poor Elizabeth when she was
here, "is it not a poor case & weddings
so seldom in Ballitore, that
two should happen while I was away
Morris Lyons is married, there
S: [unclear][/unclear] begs
thou will bring her a
little Cucumber seed &
the market quarterly
of Celery & Cauliflower
thou can get

was a great feasting dancing and musick
there). It is a most time for me
to conclude or do give my dear love
to Aunt Chandlee's family and
Aunt Higginson's I am rejoiced at
the thought of going to Carlow, I was
disappointed in not going last Quarterly
Meeting, I find it was all for the better
farewell thy affectionate
