Papa, Mama's return from Liverpool, Invitation to Glendruid,
after all - so I sent down as desired
[deletion]by[/deletion] to meet the ten O'clock train, by
which they or rather Mama came out.
Papa staid in town till the next
train. They went to town yesterday evening
instead of coming here where they
would have found everything prepared
for them. Well no matter it is
very pleasant to have them back again.
October 1st.. - First day. Papa, Avy, and I
went to meeting. Florence and Jane
returned with us to Glendruid, Uncle
R Aunt E and Mary Gough following
afterwards on a car. Grandmama seemed
pretty well and invited us three girls
to spend 6th.. day there which I hope
we [underline]shall[/underline] do. Avy and I are also
engaged to spend next third day
at Trafalgar Terrace. Mary and
Jos Carrol were at meeting to day.
It was 'Preparation' day and an Epistle
from New York was read.
October -
