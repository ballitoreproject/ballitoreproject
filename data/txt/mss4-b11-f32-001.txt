August 9th 1857
My dear Jenny
I hope in my
heart you may get leave,
& I almost think you
will, for Uncle Richard
said Uncle Edward [underline]said[/underline]
he had [underline]no[/underline] objection to
you coming, to Come,
come, come, Come to the
dear old place, & we
shall be so happy. But
I am afraid I shall
have to go home on Saturday

 so if you would come
on Wednesday, we would
have another day, shall
events come on Thursday, &
if you come by an early
train we can meet you,
if you let us know, which
you must do if you don't
come on Wednesday. The
sooner you come the
better, for you need
not be afraid of takeing
us by surprise, as the
[underline]bed is ready[/underline] for you,
& we won't put ourselves
out of our way in the

least. now we shall be
expecting you, & will
write to mamma to
get leave to stay another
week or till Teusday at
least, this day week. The
 railway car is [deletion]in[/deletion] always
at the station, & we
shall be & Tony, (the driver)
to be on the watch for
you & take care of you,
if you come by a late
train, if you come by
an early one, I can
meet you, now, if
I have not said enough
I don't know what to say

How is Nannie? I was
sorry to hear she was
so poorly. How are
little Richard & his
sister. I saw my Harry
the other day, he looked
very well & called me his
'old wife' & Edmund
is a great fat child
waddling about. I have
a great deal to talk
about, but must wait
till we meet: With dear
love & hoping soon to
 [underline]see thee[/underline] & [unclear]all[/unclear]
I remain
Ellen Cole
