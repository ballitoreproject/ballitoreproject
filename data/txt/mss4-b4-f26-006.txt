DS 79 Ballitore: 15/1 mo:1779.
My dear Sister
Near two weeks elapsing without hearing from you
we were beginning to be uneasie, but last fourth day thy acceptable
letter arrived in the Dublin-bag, and we were comforted by hearing of
your welfare and the recovery of our friends Molly Dudley and Susy
Keys: [deletion][unclear]ck[/unclear][/deletion] concerned to hear of Joseph Jackson's indisposition. Much
desire (if consistent with the divine will) he may be spared to his family
and friends. I take him to be the flower of his father's house.
I was glad to hear amiable Sally Fennell was was delivered, shall wish
to hear the same of Molly Fennell
We hope in a little time we shall be settled; our present
situation tho' [deletion]practicable [/deletion][insertion]tolerable[/insertion] is not very pleasing, my mother[deletion]s[/deletion] stays till after
supper here, and I oft fear her taking cold going so late out of a
warm room into the extreme cold frosty air: she has been at our
monthly meeting: her stomach rather disordered, last night she emptied
it: which I hope will greatly reliever her, as when it is loaded on account
of bad digestion, then she so threatened with sym[insertion]p [/insertion]toms of the nervous
complaint which is both exceedingly painful to her-self and friends

I acknowledge the justness of thy remarks on our parents, and the great
privilege that is granted us above many others in this respect, I
wish their excellent example may animate us all to press after what
they are in possession of & may our hearts be humbled and contrited
before Him, who we may daily see is full of compassion, slow to anger
& of great mercy, it is He that can warm our hearts, and create in us
good desires, it is strange for me, who am not even an infant, to ante
thus to thee, who hast more experience: this I know, that at times I am (I
trust) desirous that every haughty thing in me may be brought down,
& yet oft, very oft my im[deletion]m[/deletion]agination and thoughts wander very far astray
My brother set off fifth day for Edenderry hoping to accompany
Lydia to Dublin today or tomorrow, & to pr[deletion]o[/deletion][insertion]e[/insertion]vail on her to let him
attend her next third day to the women's meeting, Jemmy Abell &
Richard seemed much taken with Lydia, she is certainly a very graceful
person, and possessed of gentle manners & I trust will be gentle and
tender over her little charge, which really is great. Molly Pemberton
acts a very kind part towards her. Those lines of Molly's on her dear
aunt were very indeed moving I doubt [insertion]not[/insertion] but the flowing of them eased
poor Molly's distressed mine, we poor, simple people who have not these

talents find great relief by tears. I am obliged for thy concern about
my face: I can scarcely secure the sympathy of my friends, or their
congratulations till there is an alteration: now it is finely, but I
have a fine flannel to my jaw, just recovered from a fit of the
tooth-ache: poor Molly also had it & both her jaws swelled, & is flanneled
also, Sally too had a touch: but (thro' mercy) we seem all mending or
mended: our intended sister also was a fellow sufferer, we feared since
it run through the family, that thou did not escape: but hope thou hast
I do not remember that we have got the epistle thou mentions read
here yet: in time suppose we shall. Poor dear cousin Debby Christy is
kind in informing us often how are: our John much by the last
as w[insertion]h[/insertion]en he left us, she met him a day's journey from home, was
agreeably surprized a little after by the arrival of Samuel [unclear]Shavold[/unclear]
& Thomas Caugton, &c. & had their company near home with her.
they lodged at her uncle Thomas's - cousin Debby had hope that they
might be of great service in their Province, as Samuel is much beloved
there. Poor Sally Nicholson by all accounts is almost gone. Thou
I suppose heard of young John Wright's son John's miscarriage, Sally
had a moving letter from dear little Abby lately: she writes sensibly,
& by her account her poor brother is a subject of pity: the girl was
extremeley bold. Cousin Hannah Thompson has got so far in our

neighbourhood as Athy, we expect soon to be favoured with a visit from
he and Abby. I was rejoiced to hear of the recovery of the chimacy;
now I hope you will get up your crane & be relieved from a smoaky
house, and I expect my little snug chamber will be no longer annoyed
by smo[deletion]a[/deletion]ke or Sulpher - has no tooth made it's appearance in dear
little Anne's mouth, I hoped the cough was a token of teeth. I hope thy
sister Sally (John) still retains her good spirits; I suppose cousin
Robert patiently waits Thomas Wely's call. I had a letter lately
from Molly Yough: it was written the day preceding Jack Watson's
marriage, she said there would be like to be a grand appearance the
bride dressed in [unclear]robes[/unclear] of [insertion]white[/insertion] shining satin, I wish the principals of our
intended marriage may make an exemplary appearance, my mother
does not at present [insertion]intend[/insertion] going, but sending us there I should be very well
pleased to be excused: but they say it would not look handsome, as thou
can not be there: we are getting new gowns if I remember think I shall
send thee patterns: mine is a tatinet: my sister's poplin. hast thou
heard of the birth of Samuel Haughton's son, he & mother finely, their
sweet little daughter Betty was ill last fourth day, we have
not heard since we hope Hannah Haughton (prospect) is rather better
she is very loving, all our dear love attend our friends and relations
in Clonmel, you particularly: cousin Jonathan Haughton's love: he is when
I have scarce [deletion]room[/deletion] to say I am thy affectionate sister D: Shackleton.
