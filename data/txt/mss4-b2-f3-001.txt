From Richard Shackleton to J.B. on occasion of the death of James Gough.

Ballitore: 17/10 month 1780

J. B.
Dear Cousin,
	The near affection, esteem & respect which I bore to thy late father-in-law does not permit me to remain seem inattentive to his family, nor to be deficient in such visible token of friendship as is in my power to give. I therefore take this opportunity of expressing my joint concern with yours for our common loss, a loss severely felt throughout the borders of our religious society in these nations, where the report has yet spread, & attended with peculiar regret. For as love begets love, that spirit of charity, benevolence & brotherly kindness which so conspicuously influenced the disposition of that good man, did not fail to produce reciprocal affection towards him in others. We lament the steady, upright friend, the pleasing, instructive companion, the lively, experienced minister, the diligent, faithful labourer removed from amongst us. His family, who more particularly partook of the pleasure & profit arising from such good qualities & qualifications must doubtless deeply feel the privation: but this sorrow will (I trust) be so tempered ^with resignation to the divine Will, & is mingled^ with a comfortable hope of the happy end of the dear deceased, that there will ensue a quiet composure of mind, & sweet unity with his spirit safely centred [sic] in its [sic] holy rest. What remains for us is, so to pass the short, uncertain time of our sojourning here as that we at the close of all, may join the spirits of the blessed, never more to be [pencil page number] 341 separated from them. Human nature recoils with horror at the idea of everlasting exclusion from heaven & happiness, in the regions of wo [sic] & misery. And yet, if we would on any reasonable grounds expect to die the death of the righteous, & that our latter end should be like unto his, we must use all diligent endeavour to live the life of the righteous, that we may obtain at last the glorious prize, & not most unhappily miss of so great salvation. Religious parents, devoted as thy dear father-in-law was, to the service of Truth, & indefatigable in his labours for the good of others, not only purchase a blessed inheritance for themselves, but often for their successors  their pains, their prayers, their secret offerings rise in sweet memorial, & their children & families inherit the benefit thereof. Such, I hope & I believe, will (through infinite mercy) be the happy experience of most of the nearest relatives of my dear friend, & some of the branches of this valuable stock abiding the purging seasons, & submitting to the forming & turning of the Divine hand, will bear fruit grateful to God & Man. With these my spirit hath unity, & I earnestly desire their preservation & perseverance in that holy path, into which the feet of their minds have been turned; that they, in their day, may be useful & honourable, living members of the church of Christ, & that there may be a succession of testimony-bearers to that Truth, which was first, & will stand last upon earth. But should any of the visited children of a visited family, the offspring of religious parents, who have watched over them with tender attention, & often admonished them for their good; should any of these turn from the Grace of God into wantonness, trample upon his witness in their consciences, reject the calls & invitations of his Spirit, & set at naught their birth-right & education, surely dangerous as it their situation ^they are running giddily^ (as it were) on the edge of a dreadful precipice, & dallying with their destruction. With all my heart I wish that the youth amongst us were properly sensible of the magnitude of the danger of slighting, & neglecting to cultivate the merciful visitations of Heaven: that which in mercy was extended as a shepherd's crook to draw them, & help them along, will, if despised & let go, prove as an iron-rod: the same sun, which, in the visible world creation, cheers & invigorates the living, accelerates the putrefaction of the dead. As they did not like (says the Apostle) to retain God in their knowledge, (which implies that they had once known him & been visited by him), God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do these things which are not convenient: & then follows a catalogue, disgraceful, not only to Christianity, but to humanity itself. O may those children of my honoured friend, who: from their local situation are more exposed to evil than these hopeful plants of the same house, who have partaken more of parental care & nurture; may those, though they may have wandered as into a far country, & fed on unpolluted & unsubstantial food, be favoured with a fresh visitation, & recollection where they are, & whence they have strayed, & be minded to return to their heavenly Father's house, & experience the arms of mercy stretched forth in great condescension to receive them, ere it be too late, & the door be finally shut!
	I had nothing of this, dear cousin, in my apprehension or view when I begun  I only seemed to want to send some token to the family, expressive of my sympathy & friendship  this has without premeditation come from me  I shall leave it  Present my wifes & childrens, with my own affectionate respects to thy mother-in-law. Our dear love attends thee, thy spouse & her sisters. Our [pencil page number] 343 kind salutation to thy own father & his family.
	I am, dear John, with sincere good wishes for thee,
		thy affectionate friend & kinsman
