Dear John,
	++++ Be assured we take part in the good & evil that is allotted you, for we have a near & constant affection for you, & pray in my heart we may be so preserved so walking in fear & humble circumspection, that we may often witness our minds renewed by the leaven of that sweet fellowship which unites the children of one good & gracious Father; that therein & thereby we may grow; & if a little time of trial & warfare be continued to us on this stage, we may be fellow-helpers & associates in the common cause, mutually strengthening one another, & being strengthened by that Power, which supplies strength & vigour to all the several members connected together in the body.
+++
	thy affectionate kinsman
