Ballitore: 15/2 month 1786


My dear James, 
        I have felt somehow of late a listlessness about writing to my friends - not so much of an inclination that way as I have experienced - I dont [sic] say this alteration is of any thing, but of the flesh - I observe divers of our friends treating on religious subjects are apt to say they are led - they mean to lay claim to a very high authority by that expression - which I do not refuse them - but I wish them to use the term with reverence, humility & religious modesty - for there may be a being led by the light of Reason viewing clearly the subject which they are upon - they may be led by a lively imagination connecting one part of it to another - they may be led by the suggestion of the memory recollecting their own former experiences - but to be led by Truth is to be led, as I apprehend, by the immediate fresh drawings, & constraining power & virtue of the holy spirit opening, revealing, & authorizing to publish the burden of the word. So, my dear James, let thee & me, who are but as children, speak as becometh children, husband our little stock & live & act rather under than over our ability - I am sensible it is thy case - though I am led, I suppose by an accidental turn of thought to write thus. +++
        I remark thy state, my dear James, when thou dismissed thy last letter - it is a state of progressive experience, of advanced growth - thou must expect greater degrees of hardness, & of longer continuance than heretofore - thou must be content to earn thy bread by honest labour, & be glad of being put in a way to earn it, by getting employment from the Lord of the vineyard - heavenly wages, the bread of life, the wine of the kingdom is of inestimable value - none can give too much for the purchase.
