Richmond 9/9th. Month 1828.
My dearest Sarah
I write now at our united command,
to entreat thee to come on to us, from Moore. My father
sends his love to thee & says he is wishing very much to
see thee here - need I add that Sally, James thy pet, & thy own
poor Lid are equally anxious to kiss thy sweet lips on this
foreign shore" - I have very little time now to enforce my
entreaties with words of mighty power - as my time is so
limited between this & post hour. - but I must say I long
to show thee our bairnies & every thing. If Eben & Debs
would accompany thee & Edwd & Maggie & Selina we have
for you all - thou & thy bairn could have a double bedded
room for you all - thou & thy bairn could have a double bedded
room, Selina with Sally, & we have another room for our E & D
Tell Eben he promised to take Sally to Killarney this autumn
& autumn is coming - glowing & grand as usual & proud of her
many coloured ornaments. Now my dearest Sarah do not
say no, remember long threatening ought to come at last"
and for my many visits surely I ought to be paid in kind
at least once. If thou should go back to Dublin
before thou comes here I hope thou wilt
bring Selina with thee however thou arranges it
remember we shall be very glad to have her company.
In haste here against my will - but company
to tea so with dear love to the [unclear]Mainlanders[/unclear]
I am thine LfT
