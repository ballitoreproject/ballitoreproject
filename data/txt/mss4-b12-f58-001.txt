for your invite via
Fleetwood wood - I shall
bear it in mind -
It partly depends
on how I feel - as
am such a bad
sailor & I am
afraid to risk anything,
I have been
so often laid up.
these last two years -
Tis very sweet
of you to ask me
& I would of course
like to go -

I am glad to
hear you arrived
safely across = What
a pity about the
little legs of box -
The wood being old
It is more liable
to crack =
The rain has come -
It was well it
was so fine for
the King -
Much love -
Thank you so much
