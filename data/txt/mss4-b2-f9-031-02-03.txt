From the same to the same [pencil note] on the death of a child

My dear Cousin,
	It is not for want of thoughtfulness about thee that I have been silent while thou hast been in trouble. Bare words are easily spoken: but to minister consolation by words or any other mode is not at our command. There is a treasury, a repository, but we do not keep the key of it. Thou knowest it to be so. It has been opened for thee by him who keeps the key: he has fed thee out of it, & sustained thee with hidden manna - His love was always to thee, & his chastisements have been the stripes of a tender Father. Yea, I believe he will never leave, nor forsake thee. Thou hast past & may have again to pass. & we all have had to pass through the gloom & horror of the shadow of death in respect to our near friends & relations - but the arm of Gods power is sufficient, & it only is sufficient effectually to support & comfort our spirits in these trying hours. Look that way, my beloved friend; & let thy dependence be there: so shall these momentary afflictions work the end for which, with unerring wisdom, they have been sent, even to reduce & refine thee as pure & beaten gold, to fit thee for ^more fully coming up in thy several duties in this life, & prepare thee for^ a state of unmixed felicity in the next. In seasons of this sort, domestick troubles, kind friends & courteous neighbours are apt rather to overload with their visits, they mean to help, but they sometimes hurt by detaching the mind from a silent, solid waiting for the springing up of the well of true consolation. Many are strangers to the efficacious virtue which proceedeth from him, the hem of whose garment we should industriously press through the crowd that we may touch with a lively faith, & witness thereby a renewal of our spiritual strength. But as we become weary of such comforters, & retire to the Beloved of souls, pouring out our prayers & tears before him that he may be pleased to continue us & ours in his holy protection keeping & disposal, that he may correct us, but with his judgements & not in anger, lest he bring us to nothing, then ^he^ is pleased to speak peace unto us, & we see that it is in mercy & in perfect wisdom that we are thus tried & proved: so can bless his name who gives & who takes away at his pleasure, & a humble, dutiful acquiescence with his will possess our souls. May this be, & I have no doubt but this has been thy experience, my dear cousin, & I rejoice in the belief that as thou becomest more & more sequestered, separated, dedicated, thou wilt more ^& more^ feel of that substantial, everlasting good which is superior to every possible calamity, whether publick or domestic. In the fresh sense of cordial amity replenishing my heart with endeared love to thee & thine, I dearly salute you, thy father & brother James & bid you affectionately Farewell.
