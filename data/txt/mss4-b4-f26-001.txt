Altho I have nothing to write to my dear sister, that can
render my letter agreeable; yet as I hope true love and harmony
will [insertion]always[/insertion] subsist between us; I am will[insertion]ing[/insertion] to endeavour to scrible over
a few [insertion] lines [/insertion] to let you know how we are, my dear grandfather
had a fit a first day evening, pretty acute pain in his back,
about two a clock in the night his pain abated; but left
him very sore: he is today a good deal better but one thing that [deletion][/deletion] surprizd
us was, a first day before he had the fit, he had two motions: my aunt
is afraid he got some cold when she was at meeting; as he got out of bed;
he desires his love to his friends, I have been there almost every day since:
Nancy Sparkes goes one part of the day and I the other: she is indeed very
helpfull Sally bravely, I think Ned Eape the worst of our family, I fear
he is in a decay, he takes brandy and milk every morning, flaxseed tea at
night: hope mother will get some advice for him. We have not heard
from poor Alby only he got to Barlow his legs were greatly swelled
I fear he will not be able to proceed much farther.
The meeting is now almost over I doubt not but those who went
with dificulty will have there reward: we were concerned to hear of
Thomas Wily & Joseph Jacob fall, hope they were not prevented attending
the meeting. greatly disapointed at Samuel Fathergill's not intending to
come here, I have some hopes still: I was glad to hear that he had
an agreeable opportunity at the Quay, and that thou was there they

younger branches of that family seems in a very particular [deletion][/deletion] [insertion] manner [/insertion] under
the notice of kind providence I have often thought that those have not
so good exa[insertion]m[/insertion]ples as could be wished; are in in a more particular manner under
the immediate notice of providence: May we who have good examples profit
by it, we shall be left with [insertion] out [/insertion] excuse at last: I have frequent fears for myself.
How is Betty's jaw does Sally or Hannah talk of writing to me
I am very jealous of the latter; I lent her Elizabeth Ashbridge's life which
Johnny taked of copying but I suppose had [insertion] not time [/insertion] if she goes to sent it by thee
please to tell if she can read [insertion] it [/insertion] (which I fear she cannot it is so badly wrote)
I thinks it worth her exceptance, I beg she may keep it.
[deletion][/deletion] thinks it worth her exceptance, I beg she may keep it.
I wrote to my father last post my mother by Nanny so hope they will
excuse my not writing to either of [insertion] them [/insertion] now. Cousin Betty desires my mother may
be let her know that we want hops
Please to present my duty and love where proper
Nancy sparks love to you mine to the Quay family I forgot to say Sally is not gone
to the Mill the weather has not been favourable for her she is down today
believe if the weather grows a litter warmer she will go tomorrow
Farewell my dear Peggy, I hope we will have you [deletion][/deletion] home soon
I am thy affectionate Sister
