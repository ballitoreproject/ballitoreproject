Limerick March 16th 1831
4th day
My dear Sarah,
At Lydia's wish I write, as she
is almost constantly by the bed side of
her poor little Willy, to say that though
our hopes on his account were a little
uplifted since her return, yet he has
been again so ill as almost to preclude
hope - last night the pain & great beat
in his head returned, accompanied by
a restlessness & moving his head from
side to side_ There were several leeches
again applied & another blister on
the head, about where the other thus had
been put - however, he got the night
better than was expected - & seems
improved today - tho' on that account
we are desired not to be too much cheered

the extreme inaction of his bowels
makes the doctor very uneasy - we
hope the blister is rising - his pulse
are lowered - and he has had but very
little flushing in the face - our dear
Lydia does not appear to be injured
by the shock & her continual fatigue
and anxiety. I hope we shall be
able to persuade her to take care of
herself without neglecting her duty
as a mother - Polly got a little cold
travelling, but it does not seem to signify.
Lydia desires her dear love to thee,
& I say how she had not given &
write, beside being tired with having
sat up last night - that she, and
those round his bed last night did
not think the morning would see
him alive - his case is a very

precarious one - which, whatever way
it [deletion]preponderat[/deletion] terminates is not likely
to be decided one way or other for
days, perhaps weeks - we can hardly
say that hope & fear alternately preponderate,
as the latter is so much
the most overwhelming - we shall
however not be long without again,
letter, [unclear][/unclear] know how the dear
little [unclear]su[/unclear]fferer continues.
I am dear Sarah, in haste,
thy affecte. S Fisher.

For
Sarah
