dance without my [insertion]Richmond 31: of 10th month 1823[/insertion] assistance
This is intruding on my wife's domain - So farewell my dear Sarah
as I am afraid to cross without leave - yours truly JJ.F
My dearest Sarah
I have so much to say to thee that I
not where to begin - whether first to scold Edward - or
talk of this time twelvemonths when I was with thee,
or tell thee of my cold - or of Thomas's uncle or aunt
Payne - or of the cold weather or - what. Trust then
for I know that this will give thee pleasure, my cold
& cough are quite gone & at the time thy "Ah! thou
hast a cough"! [insertion]came[/insertion] I had scarcely any. Tell Edward I am
[underline]seriously[/underline] displeased with him for not sending me my
property - viz: the letter he had written to me, & tell
him if he dont send it soon I will write a great
scolding - & that if he does I will write as pleasant
an epistle as possible. - This time twelvemonths I was
with thee gay & hearty - making thee laugh [underline]too[/underline] much
cracking nuts, roasting apples - roving thro' woods by
moonlight & candle light, dancing jumping - now I
am far from thee - a bumpy, dumpy, grumpy
wife - ach hone! - The Paynes thank heaven
have left us - they were with us a week - The
woman was tolerably gay for an English woman - had
been once in France & could not help ever bringing
it on the tapis - The husband an incessant grumbler
always scolding his wife & so forth - I argued stoutly
for my country & kept the English pride of

power. - 1st of 11th month. - I have not got the box
yet, but expect it by some of Fishers & [unclear]Unsthank's[/unclear]
carmen on 2nd day. - Joss Harvey will bring thee
this & the gloves & the enclosed Â£3 - if I owe thee
more it will be easily settled by next opportunity.
I hope the gloves will please thee my dear S-.
Had thou any later news of Debs: - I am daily
expecting a letter from Betsy with more particulars.
I had a letter from Elizth last evening telling me a
great deal of news - a very pleasant letter.
Does Maggie attempt walking, talking [deletion]&[/deletion] yet? -
Thou don't mention her half particularly enough - I would
like to know every thing about - even the colour & cut
of her clothes. - What about Eliza? - Dost thou think
she will accept Richd.? - & what do uncle & aunt B -
say to the overture? - I am sadly in the dark about
every thing belonging to you. - Richd's affair has never
been mentioned to me from home - & so slightly by
thee, that had I not known of it I could not have
suspected it. - He told me all he then knew himself
when here - & that is all I have ever heard - Thou
may remember a secret I once mentioned to thee in
a letter - but told no more - this was it.
I intend accompanying my father to Clonmel in
about a week - he will proceed to Ballitore - &

to Clonmel
James will come for me [insertion]to Clonmel[/insertion]. Thou knows all about
Anne Grubb of course. - Every one [underline]now[/underline] says
Tom Murray is worthy of her. - We have as yet
done nothing about the house - [deletion]nor[/deletion] [insertion]&[/insertion] cannot until
father returns from Ballitore. Poor Jane Malone!
I pity her for the loss of her daughter - & she takes
grief so sorely to heart. - I would like to be
remembered to her & her two eldest daughters. -
Dost thou remember how kind Elizth was to
me this time twelvemonth. - I had a very
kind letter from Eliza B. -
If I can I will reply by Joss.
At any rate give her & all at
Tho glen my love. -- Thomas is still here & still
[underline]almost[/underline] completely idle - he teaches Aunt Jane's
children two or three hours. - every day except 1st
& 5th - but that is but little. - I pity S.G. greatly -
but what use is pity! -
I thought I had a great deal to say yesterday
but to day I am dumb.
I have room here to tell you
to Maggie)
that I am
quite rich in [underline]nieces[/underline] now
having two (one of whom shall be, because she [underline]is[/underline], nameless)
Love to Edward - kisses
Ever thy affte. LJ Fisher
oh how happy we were
to her of dear Debs & her baby being so unexpectedly well-

My dear Sal, As Lyd says nothing about me I
must even introduce myself - Why do you not write
longer letters & tell us more of every thing you are doing -
I thought we should have had an account from you
of all you had seen in England, instead of which you scarce
seem to acknowledge that you were there - Had you your
eyes shut all the time you were passing the Cumberland
lakes - I hardly know even if you were [underline]there[/underline] - you are
sadly incommunicative and I think Lyd has not been showing
you a good example in this short letter - Kiss my dear little
niece for me & tell her I long to give her another throw into
