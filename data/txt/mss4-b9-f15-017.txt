Alexander Forbes's 10 St Patrick square Edinburgh 8th of 11th Month 1821.
Thomas Fisher to Sarah Leadbeater
As the Professors & Grinders have given us a holiday, - & as I have just finished
getting my lesson for my grinder to-morrow morning, - to thee, my friend Sarah, I dedicate
these first-fruits, of my leisure moments for from thee I find I have three communications
unanswered - & to the notice of these said communications I shall forthwith
proceed, for, although this being [deletion]my[/deletion] [insertion]the[/insertion] first letter to Ballitore which I [underline]began[/underline] since my arrival, it
might be thought I should relate in it an account of my travels, hitherward - yet I beg
leave to tell whosoever thinks so, - that [deletion][insertion]it does not follow[/insertion][/deletion] because this is the first letter [insertion]to Ballitore which[/insertion] I [underline]began[/underline] since my
arrival, [insertion]it does not follow[/insertion] that it will be the first which I shall [underline]finish[/underline], - or the [underline]first[/underline] - or [underline]second[/underline] - or [underline]third[/underline]
which I shall send - this letter, gentle reader! - is to be written by adjournments - I shall
write by post in a few days -
Having now I hope, satisfied the objections of my imaginary friend - I turn to
thee, - a more substantial one; - & to thy communication which came, accompanied by
sundry others, in a frank dated June 6th. - this communication is [underline]anent[/underline] a certain dispute
which arose in your classic vale "as to the propriety of attending the theatre, its [unclear]use[/unclear] &c." - & thou
tells me that a word or two on this subject in my next would be acceptable - now as this
is my next - I shall send thee an acceptable word or two on the subject. Thou tells me
that some say plays are of use - & refers me to Shakespeare's Hamlet - but unfortunately
Hamlet is not just at my hand at present, - & I cannot therefore immediately refer to
it - but Shakespeare should be listened to on this subject with some caution, - as he stands in
the situation of one who speaks in his own cause - he is a biased witness, - however he [underline]should[/underline]
be listened to. - Thy argument against them I consider the strongest which can be alleged. -
that is - that, by attending the theatre, we contribute to the support of a profession which
can scarcely be considered as compatible with a religious life. - I agree with thee in
the opinion that a well-regulated mind might witness a play without injury - but thy
query - whether a well-regulated mind would seek these scenes from choice - can not I
think be answered in the affirmative [insertion]in the present state of the Theatre[/insertion] - the principles of Friends I consider as particularly
opposed to the [underline]generality[/underline] of stage representations - it is the morality of the world, -
not Quaker morality which is there held up as an example to imitate - & I would join
with the poet Campbell in [deletion]doubting[/deletion] [insertion]questioning[/insertion] the morality of [insertion]any[/insertion] one who professed to frequent the
theatre as a [underline]school of morals[/underline] - [underline]as thou wishes to be established either a friend or an[/underline]
+ It is not my next - but no matter -
in an account which I sent him of my highland trip) of the expression [underline]"contortions[/underline] of the river Firth" - pray did I use such a
contorted expression to my letter to thou?- I must mind in future not to twist rivers- John Rickman has invited all the friend students
here to dine with him [deletion]as follo[/deletion] next 5th day; they are as follows: - Joseph Wess, from Bristol, (not a medical student) - John Averend, from Sheffield
Godfrey Hewett, - from I forget where, - [deletion]& Thomas[/deletion] Edward Arh. from Bristol, & Thomas Fisher, from Limerick -
Thou mayest remember about a year ago I was very uneasy at being put on one of the Committees of the medical society, -
but "tempora mutantur & nos mutamur in illis" - I am now canvassing as hard as I can to be elected a member of the Library
committee, & am in great hopes I shall succeed - at least some of my friends active members & two of them Presidents, have no
doubt of my success- I heard lately of Henry Gaulter, - his general health & spirits are pretty poor, & he intends being here in March -
I wish he & John Leeky would meet in Italy. - I paid a visit last 7.th day to James Grahame, & while I was there the eldest daughter
(a beautiful creature) - & her husband David Bankine came in, - she, has invited me to meet them there at tea next seventh day evening, -
they were all enquiring after Mr. Eugene, - as they call our friend Theodore.- She has sent me a poem of her brother's called "The
Sabbath" - to read- I called on her again yesterday [deletion]to take[/deletion] [insertion]& brought[/insertion] her to a public meeting held at our meeting house by the desire of two English
Ministering friends, - who are here at present, - [insertion]her nephew Thomas Grahame was with us,[/insertion]I have not seen her since.-
I spent [deletion]a day[/deletion] yesterday wining very agreeably at George Miller's - [insertion]his son[/insertion] William, an engraver, a very well-informed young man, is now
at home;- John Everend, the Sheffield student was there, & was entertaining us with anecdotes of France - he having spent a winter there.
I had this day a delightful letter from Theodore [unclear]Sevliot,[/unclear] with a few lines from Betsy (promising more) - & from thy sister Lydia. - But my dear
friend I must bid thee farewell as it is almost 11 o'clock at night, & I have several letters to write, & to prepare for the grinder besides -
now Sarah, ah! do write soon like a good girl - Farewell -

enemy to the theatre, - I hope thou wilt become a decided enemy to it, - & that I may never
see thee at one, or thou me. - "But" - to use thy own words "all these things mind are
between ourselves, & not to be blazon'd out to all Ballitore"
Now for thy "frankful of letter-shreds" - which, though I noticed them in my highland
letter, I have not yet replied to - well, I have since read them over, [insertion]the whole [underline]seven[/underline] of them[/insertion] - & tho' there are some
little matters hinted at in them which I should like to chat about in a walk by our two
selves - or in an [underline]ingle nook[/underline] - yet they are not worth mentioning in a letter.-
Thy [underline]third[/underline] & last communication arrived while I was away - but it is a mere
[underline]scrap[/underline] I find. I must now bid thee farewell for the present, - as I want to deliver the
letter of introduction which Theodore Suliot gave me for Mrs. Grahame.
2 o'clock P.M.- I have just returned from Queen-street,- & Mrs. Grahame is at [underline]kirk[/underline], &
will not be home until 4 o'clock; - I may find her at home, the servant says, between 10 &
11 to-morrow;- thus am I foiled at my second attempt.-
20th As I unexpectedly find some leisure on my hands to-night, having prepared myself
for the grinder to-morrow morning. I propose devoting it to thee; - had I foreseen early enough that
I should have had this evening to spare, I would probably have spent it at John Rickman's or
Mrs. Grahame's - but it is too late now - & thou art a friend who art [underline]older[/underline] than either of them.
(I don't mean more advanced in years, but longer on "my list of friends") - I may therefore
justly claim a preference. - I need not say much at present about Mrs. Grahame, as I wrote
to thy mother pretty fully about her last seventh day week, - but if I should happen to call
upon her before I finish this letter, - I can tell thee more about her. I had a letter yesterday,
from thy sister Lydia, which had an effect on me that no letter from her ever had before,
[deletion]&[/deletion] that is, - it [underline]disappointed[/underline] me - but this requires explanation. - I had been [deletion]expecting[/deletion] indulging
yesterday a slight expectation of receiving either from thy mother, - or one of her daughters a reply
to my letter about Mrs. Grahame, - & as I was coming home to dinner about 3 o'clock was thinking
to myself "Who knows but a letter from Ballitore awaits me at my lodgings?" - & on opening my
door, - I saw a letter on [deletion][/deletion] the table; - without waiting to shut the door, or take off my hat
or coat - I darted over & seized it - [deletion]took it up[/deletion] saw the frank dated Ballitore & at the seal impressed
with L. J. L - " The very thing I was expecting"- thought I - & sat down by the fire, to
read it in comfort - but [deletion]was rather[/deletion]what was my mortification at finding that it had been
dispatched from your post-office the night before my letter (according to my expectation) should have
arrived [deletion][/deletion]- & contained only a [underline]short[/underline] letter from Lydia - This letter begins thus: "Thou wilt
be surprised, I suppose to receive a letter from Ballitore" - "no" thought I, "for I have been expecting
one" - & more so from one to whom thou owes one" - "of this I am not convinced at all"
thought I - " from I never got a reply to my long letter which James Garrate coveyed from Dublin

lin,- & I have in her own handwriting a promise to begin one on a [underline]Brobdingnagian[/underline]
sheet,- & she would have known that I was waiting for this Brobdingnagian sheet, if she had kept
this panb a day longer." - She tells me Deborah half promised to write to me - I should be
exceedingly glad to get a letter from Deborah, but I cannot in justice claim it, as I am in
debt to her, & intend paying her next month - but not so to Lydia. - She begs I will not wait
for the Pliate to write to her - indeed I will, & for Sir Walter's next novel, if she don't write first -
she acknowleges her last to be only to a newspaper - & therefore with a newspaper I shall
answer it. -
I am very comfortably settled in lodgings at present, - & find that I have much more time
to myself than I had at Helen Gillier's, - & I have generally enough to do.- From 8 to 9 in the
morning I attend the [underline]grinder[/underline] - I breakfast between 9 & 10 - from 10 to 12 I attend a course of
Practical Pharmacy, - from 1 to 2 a lecture on Anatomy - from 2 to 3 I walk, - at 3 I dine, -
from 4 to 5 two days in the week, I attend a surgical lecture - & the evenings I generally employ
in preparing for the [underline]grinder[/underline] - There is a friend from Bristol, a medical student lodges
in the same house - his name is Edward Ark - he is rather agreeable - but not altogether so delightful
a companion as Thomas Hodgkin. I believe I shall stop now, - & wait until I have something
interesting to tell thee & [unclear]leisure[/unclear]to say it. -
26th I now sit down again to address thee, not that I have
any great stock of leisure-time in my hands,- for I have not had a
moment to myself all day. & am obliged to stay from lecture to write
this; but, as [deletion]thou[/deletion] Joseph Malcomson of Belfast is in town & goes to Ireland
in a day or two,- I think it a pity o let the opportunity pass, without sending
off the sheet, whether I shall be able to fill it or not. -
The night after I wrote the portion of this letter which is dated the 20th I
went to spend the evening at John Rickman's - where I had not been since I
returned, - Elizabeth R. having been lately delivered of a son, - I waited until
she was so far recovered as to be down stairs - she is now finely as is also
her little boy - I [deletion]to[/deletion] spent a very pleasant evening of course - but Sarah
Godly (- of whom I told this on the jaunting car near Athy) - was, the greater
part of the time, reading her Latin lesson to Frank Sibson - for thou must
know that she has been for the last few weeks one of his private pupils - she is
very clever, & can read Virgil, Horace & Cicero, - & yet is as lively & unaffected
as if she never saw a latin book in her life - John Rickman tells me I have
brought back a little of the [underline]brogue[/underline] from Ireland; - he was also telling me that
I afforded him & his friends a good deal of amusement by [deletion]mentioning[/deletion] [insertion]making use,[/insertion]
