13th.. First-day. A smaller meeting of friends than I expected in this
place. S:T laboured honestly amongst them, yet after meeting did not feel
herself much relieved. The afternoon meeting put off till 6 o'clock, for S:H,
& the towns-folk invited, an abundance came, who heard the Gospel
preached with life & power, & behaved very decently: to me it was, I
think, the most agreeable we have latterly been at. S:T & I sup'd at
S:H's lodging, Alexander Crookshank's, & suddenly after supper, my mind
felt so overpowered with the mercy of good Providence, employing his
poor servants thus, & supporting, & marvellously helping them through
the labour of the day, that I thought I could not contain, but inshort
began to tell them how I had been contemplating, in the midst of their
conversation:- the two Sarahs spoke afterwards, & particularly to young
men present; one, a cousin of Sally Birkbeck's, whose situation, being
in the colledge here, studying Physick, she laments. 14th.. In the evening
